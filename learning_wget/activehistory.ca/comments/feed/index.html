		<title>Comment on A Review of The Education of Augie Merasty: A Residential School Memoir by Jennifer</title>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;What’s missing, however, for the lay reader who hasn’t researched or closely followed news of the Canada’s residential School system and its aftermath, however, is some additional historical context—perhaps as a stand-alone chapter—that would position Augie’s experiences at St. Therese in a broader context. Was St. Therese typical of residential school, or a particularly harsh institution? Moreover, this context might flesh out some of the personages he knew only through a child’s eyes. What might archival records share about Sisters St. Mercy and St. Joy, or Brother Lepeigne’s careers and lives?&quot;

This book is very poignant and descriptive. Powerful and thought provoking. I feel that there was nothing missing from that of a experience of a young child. For the lay reader to get more information that hasn&#039;t &quot;researched or closely followed news of the residential school system&quot;, I feel that this book is the beginning for the general public to start their journey in finding out and researching for themselves. This is the starting point of for many, reconciliation. As for historical context of the school itself, the public must understand that this was all hidden so long and buried, that even survivors children(like myself) can not access the history of the schools or what went on there for that matter. The church protected the people that preyed upon the children, those records will never be for the general member of the public to be seen. So for those that want to know more, learn from the people still here to tell their stories, they are now coming forward after how many years of silence, how about offer them the respect they never received and not question more about the later, follow the silence from the stories to ensure that children and generations after us begin to show empathy for the people and for the horrific history of this part of Canada. For reconciliation finally.]]></description>

It bothers me that this kind of dialogue creates a false sense of equivalency to this &quot;debate.&quot; One writer offers tepid, weak arguments based on faulty logic and limited knowledge of historical context. The other easily exposes those weaknesses using ample evidence, broad knowledge of relevant context, and sound reasoning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] About six months before the release of “L’Empire du Côté Obscur,” Noir Désir’s “Un jour en France” – one of the musically and lyrically brilliant 666.667 Club’s big hits – had also noted the growing popularity of Jean-Marie Le Pen’s party, now enjoying the support of “a few quasi-fascists amounting to approximately 15%.” But the band, which did not conceal its sympathies for the peripheral but then-promising Trotskyist LCR (Ligue communiste révolutionnaire), also vilified the EU’s neoliberal policies. Worthy of note is also the inclusion, in “Un jour en France,” of a reference to Charlie Hebdo’s petition for the outlawing of the Front national – another example (among many others) that contradicts the many accusations (mostly in the British, American, and Canadian press) that the weekly held profoundly racist views.
