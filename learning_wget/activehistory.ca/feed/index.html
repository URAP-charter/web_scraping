Blake Brown</p></div>
<p><strong>John Robson&#8217;s response:</strong></p>
<p>It is flattering that R. Blake Brown responded on Activehistory to my recent article “The Right to Bear Arms” published in the Autumn/Winter 2016 <a href="https://www.dorchesterreview.ca/"><em>Dorchester Review</em></a>, to which I am a contributing editor. His <em>Arming and Disarming</em> is a scrupulously researched book I found helpful in the documentary from which my article was drawn. But I must protest that he misrepresents my argument in several important ways.</p>
<p>He expends considerable energy demolishing the claim that Canadians today enjoy a constitutionally protected right to bear arms enforceable through the courts. But I never made any such assertion. In the documentary we show the opposite, in part citing the case involving Donna and Bruce Montague that he also mentions. And I make it plain throughout the <em>Dorchester Review</em> piece that such a claim is now met with derision and bafflement particularly within the Canadian government. (Which, it seems necessary to stress in the face of frequent media references to “the government” losing a court case, is expressly declared in the Constitution Act 1867 to consist of three branches, the executive, legislative and judiciary.)</p>
<p>What I do say, and here Brown misrepresents my argument largely by omission, is that we did long enjoy this right as part of a robust protection of individual rights inherited from Britain that was the foundation of our success as a nation. If we have recently discarded that inheritance, on matters from free speech to property to self-defence, we ought at least to acknowledge that doing so represents a dramatic change of course even if we support that change.<span id="more-20985"></span></p>
<p>Here I must take issue with his hasty dismissal of “a handful of statements made by nineteenth-century politicians” such as Sir John A. Macdonald in support of the right to bear arms protected in the British 1688/89 Bill of Rights. He says “Robson fails to note that references to such a right were relatively rare in the nineteenth century” but himself fails to note that they were rarely necessary because it was so broadly taken for granted that the subject rarely arose.</p>
<p>Like the court that heard Bruce Montague’s appeal, he makes strikingly short work of my assertion that the preamble to the British North America Act declaring our constitution “similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom” means it incorporated protections from the Bill of Rights and indeed Magna Carta, and more generally granted us limited government and robust individual rights on the British model. Yet the drafters, on both sides of the Atlantic, must have thought this phrase meant something important. If it is not what I assert, whatever can it have been, given that our 1867 Constitution was both federal and entirely written in one place, very much unlike the British one?</p>
<p>Instead Brown leaps immediately to a 2009 Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruling against the right to possess firearms. That a right is no longer respected, legally or otherwise, in 2009 is hardly evidence that it was not respected in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century when people like Macdonald rejected gun control on the grounds that the Bill of Rights was indeed incorporated into our Constitutional order, any more than courts’ increasing sympathy to restrictions on free speech today means it was not protected in 1890 or, indeed, that it ought not to be better protected than it currently is.</p>
<p>In this context Brown did catch me in an embarrassing mistake, a quotation I attributed to William Blackstone that was in fact from the Recorder of London, chief legal advisor to the mayor and council, in 1780. I obtained it from a secondary source but of course should have checked Blackstone directly before quoting. (As to his reproaching me for not quoting the Bill of Rights directly, I did in the documentary.) But Brown goes on to say that “Blackstone enunciated a much more limited right – that subjects had a right to have arms ‘for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law.’” And I must protest this selective quotation.</p>
<p>In the very next paragraph, at the very end of Chapter I of Book I of his <em>Commentaries</em>, Liberty Fund digital edition, Blackstone wrote “to vindicate these rights, when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next, to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and, lastly, to the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence. And all these rights and liberties it is our birthright to enjoy entire; unless where the laws of our country have laid them under necessary restraints: restraints in themselves so gentle and moderate, as will appear, upon further inquiry, that no man of sense or probity would wish to see them slackened.”</p>
<p>It is difficult to misread this passage as denying a broad right to bear arms that Englishmen in the Thirteen Colonies certainly believed they enjoyed at precisely this period. Especially given that Blackstone applies his “gentle and moderate” qualification equally to the “free course of justice in the courts of law”. Surely Brown would not on this basis claim that Blackstone enunciated only a limited right to due process.</p>
<p>Canada’s Founders learned their law from men like Blackstone. And if his assertion about “having and using arms for self-preservation and defence” is no longer true today, it is not proof that it was not true in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and earlier, nor that we are wiser that our forebears in extending the power of the state at the expense of individual rights.</p>
<p>Brown reproaches me for making “no mention of the fact that the meaning and extent of the English right found in the Bill of Rights has been debated fiercely in the past twenty-five years”. As a trained historian I am of course aware that scholars have fiercely debated everything imaginable from whether Stalin was a Marxist to whether guns were common in the antebellum United States to whether texts have any meaning. But as the great G.K. Chesterton once said, “The object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid.” And in this case that Bill of Rights guarantee meant exactly what it was understood to mean by practical politicians, learned commentators and the general public at the time and for more than 200 years afterward.</p>
<p>Brown concludes by accusing me of a “one-sided account” encouraging “the polarization of the gun control issue” and of “mostly peddling things that <em>sound</em> true.” But with apologies for the mistaken attribution of that one Blackstone quotation, what I am encouraging is understanding our historical origins clearly, whether or not one is sympathetic to them in whole or in part. And it does not merely <em>sound</em> true that the English liberties we inherited included a broad right to bear arms from before Magna Carta, which Blackstone rightly notes was “obtained, sword in hand, from King John”, down through roughly the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>It is true.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><strong>R. Blake Brown replies:</strong></p>
<p>In his <em>Dorchester Review</em> article Robson challenges what he describes as mainstream thinking about the history of firearms in Canada. He argues that the English constitution, and thus by extension the Canadian constitution, traditionally included a right to bear arms. He notes that politicians have disarmed groups deemed suspicious even though, Robson contends, there is a no correlation between regulating firearms and lowering rates of gun crime (in fact he suggests the opposite is true). Robson also asserts that firearms have been important in successful efforts to resist government tyranny. Finally, he claims that advocates of postwar efforts to regulate ‘average’ gun owners (such as hunters and target shooters) failed to appreciate Canada’s long history of widespread private firearm ownership.</p>
<p>I have no quibbles with some of these claims. In my book, <em>Arming and Disarming: A History of Gun Control in Canada</em>, I demonstrate that, yes, politicians have periodically attempted to limit firearm ownership or use by ‘suspicious’ groups. Robson’s reminder that Canada had, and has, a relatively high rate of private firearm ownership compared to many other nations is also not surprising. However, as I indicated in my earlier Active History post, I have concerns about some of Robson’s other assertions, particularly his comments about a right to bear arms in Canada<em>.</em></p>
<p>In his response, Robson rejects that he suggested in the <em>Dorchester Review</em> that Canadians now have a right to possess arms. As I noted in my original piece, his website asserts otherwise: “your right to bear arms is as Canadian as maple syrup.” I think that many readers of Robson’s article would also draw the conclusion that Canadians had, and still have, such a right since he begins by positing that Canadians’ “long and glorious tradition of liberty” includes “a proud right to bear arms.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a> In his response Robson claims that in Canada “we did long enjoy this right as part of a robust protection of individual rights inherited from Britain,” but that “we have recently discarded that inheritance.” This kind of explicit qualifier, however, is absent from his <em>Dorchester Review</em> article.</p>
<p>Such a qualifier is also absent from his documentary <a href="http://www.arighttoarms.com/">“A Right to Arms”</a>, from which he says he drew his article in the <em>Dorchester Review</em>.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a> Robson suggests that the right to possess firearms is under threat, not that no such right currently exists. For example, he argues the right to bear arms was constitutionally entrenched in England, but “as it erodes we become less Canadian.” He also includes a sympathetic interview with gun-rights activist Bruce Montague, in which Mr. Montague claims that “We have a right to own our firearms – a God-given right and a constitutionally-protected right to own and use our firearms for self-defence.” Robson does not contradict Mr. Montague’s assertion.</p>
<p>In addition, in the concluding segment of his documentary (entitled “A Canadian Right”) Robson asserts that if Canadians want their nation “to remain worthy of true patriot love” then they must preserve their heritage, including an “emphasis upon individual rights – the right of free speech and free assembly, the right to own property, the right to choose and control our governments, and the right to possess and use weapons to defend ourselves, our homes, our communities, and our nation.” It seems clear to me that Robson intends to create the perception that the right to bear arms is under attack, not that “we have recently discarded that inheritance.”</p>
<p>However, let’s assume that Robson simply wants to claim that such a right existed in Canada until it was “recently discarded.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a> I must then ask: where is the evidence to support this? He does not disagree with my claim that only a handful of nineteenth-century politicians ever voiced this view, but says such comments were “rarely necessary because it was so broadly taken for granted that the subject rarely arose.” Absence of evidence is thus conveniently turned into evidence for widespread acceptance of a right to bear arms.</p>
<p>This is dubious. British North Americans (and early Canadians) frequently spoke about their civil liberties. Let me illustrate this with one example. In my first book, <em>A Trying Question: The Jury in Nineteenth-Century Canada</em>, I examined debates about the jury system in nineteenth-century Upper Canada / Ontario and Nova Scotia.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a> Many legislators, lawyers, and judges referred to the jury as the ‘palladium of liberty’ and spoke of the role of juries in defending subjects against oppressive rule. In comparison, I only found a small handful of allusions to the right to possess weapons, and these references stopped by the 1880s.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is more evidence of the widespread acceptance of a right to bear arms in Canada that I have not seen. I have never come across a nineteenth-century legal case in which it is mentioned. My efforts to find more references to this right in newspapers and in historical databases proved fruitless.</p>
<p>One might support the idea that many Canadians believed in such a right by showing that legislators consistently refused to pass laws affecting gun possession. However, many politicians agreed to legislation affecting firearm possession when they felt circumstances warranted. For example, the introduction of inexpensive revolvers in the last decades of the nineteenth-century sparked concerns about interpersonal violence and accidents. Parliament thus passed measures that placed limits on firearm possession. In 1877 Ottawa regulated the carrying of pistols. In 1892 and 1913, Ottawa strengthened the rules regarding pistols, and in 1934 the federal government created a handgun registry.</p>
<p>The introduction of such measures also demonstrates the limited nature the English Bill of Rights provision. Robson’s response does not engage with the obvious limits embedded in the language of Article 7<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[v]</a>; instead, he quotes a supportive passage from Blackstone’s <em>Commentaries</em>. But, does Robson think that the right was restricted to Canadian Protestant men? Or to just men of means? More importantly, how does Robson respond to the clause that the right to possess arms was “as allowed by Law”?</p>
<p>And remember that the English Bill of Rights was not equivalent to the American Bill of Rights or the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It was an ordinary statute that could be overridden by other acts of Parliament. As Canada’s leading constitutional scholar, Peter Hogg, explains, “the central feature of the Constitution of the United Kingdom, and of its Parliament, was in 1867, and still is, parliamentary sovereignty: any of the civil liberties, including freedom of political speech, can be abolished by the Parliament at Westminister at any time.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[vi]</a> The history of gun control in the United Kingdom nicely illustrates this. The British Parliament passed a series of strict gun controls in the twentieth century. This begs the question: if even the British do not take the English Bill of Rights provision seriously, why should Canadians?</p>
<p>I am also perplexed that Robson continues to pursue the idea that an English right to possess arms was incorporated into Canadian law through the preamble of the <em>BNA Act.</em> Courts have rejected that argument. Robson writes on this subject without references so it is difficult to determine the source of this position. He may have taken it from an unpublished paper written by political scientist (and politician) Ted Morton with the financial assistance of several gun groups. Morton uses several sketchy legal arguments, including the English Bill of Rights / <em>BNA Act</em> preamble claim, to question the constitutionality of Canada’s gun laws.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref1"><sup>[vii]</sup></a> However, Morton, like Robson, seems to offer this interpretation simply because it <em>sounds</em> plausible.</p>
<p>A.J. Somerset, author of the fascinating book <em>Arms: The Culture and Credo of the Gun</em>, recently tweeted that “Arguments that Canada has a right to bear arms periodically come back to life, like persistent zombies.”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[viii]</a> I suspect several factors explain the persistence of such claims. Many gun owners, annoyed with the firearm laws passed after the 1989 Montreal Massacre, have longed for the ability to claim a right to their weapons like American gun owners. Invoking the English constitutional lineage also has the advantage of stoking romantic notions of a version of Canada defined by stability, order, and liberty – of Canada at a time when judges and politicians valued property rights and the right to defend one’s home.</p>
<p>The call for recognition of gun rights thus reflects a desire to reorient Canadian political and legal culture. This may be what motivates Robson. In his documentary, he claims that “Canadians are capable and self reliant people who can be trusted, far more than governments can be trusted, to make judgments about what needs to be done and how it needs to be done.” Perhaps, but this is a political opinion, not a historical fact.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">[i]</a>John Robson, “Armed Canadians: A Brief History,” <em>Dorchester Review</em>, 6:2 (2016), 57.</p>
<p><a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2">[ii]</a>Robson wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on American foreign policy during the Nixon administration, and there are times when his lack of academic background in Canadian history is evident in the documentary.  For example, Robson says that the rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada in 1837 and 1838 resulted in the granting of “representative government.”  I assume he means responsible government, since the Canadas had long had representative government.</p>
<p><a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3">[iii]</a>If Robson believes the right to possess firearms does not now exist in Canada, I strongly encourage him to state this in his keynote address at the upcoming “Right to Firearms” seminar hosted by the Canadian Unlicensed Firearms Owners Association.

<p>Every year in June the Ottawa RibFest takes place along Sparks Street, a block from Parliament Hill. And every year that event gives animal rights protesters a perfect opportunity to express their views. A <a href="http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/06/23/ribfest-dottawa-peta-replique-avec-un-barbecue-humain_n_10640554.html">Huffington Post Québec</a> article offers a good indication of the 2016 response from PETA: identity inverted, a fleshy female protester is transformed into a fleshy animal on the grill. A roast to roast the RibFest.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>This is the kind of powerful imagery charged with sexuality and violence for which PETA has become infamous. It is also part of what presumably separates the modern animal rights movement from that of its predecessor, the animal welfare movement, which traces its origins to the eighteenth century and which blossomed in the Victorian era.<span id="more-20994"></span></p>
<p>I find PETA’s work fascinating. But I also find the presumed newness of these strategies to be problematic. I say this because, when it comes to the rights and the well-being of animals, the work that was done during the latter half of the nineteenth century has frequently been characterized as a series of halfway measures centered as much on collective self-interest as genuine concern. During the 1980s, social historians did much to establish a view of the animal welfare movement as a middle-class means to regulate the lower classes, while many proponents of the animal rights movement that took shape in the 1970s present their predecessors as well-meaning but inferior counterparts to a new and qualitatively different approach to human-animal relations.</p>
<p>The image below tells another story. In my chapter in <em>Animal Metropolis</em> I discuss the gender dimensions of the animal welfare movement in Canada during the Victorian era. One of the observations it makes concerns the ways in which both the opponents and the supporters of animal welfare found it useful to re-categorize their subjects along gender and species lines – in discussions for and against animal welfare, animals became humans, men became women, and women, very often, became animals.</p>

<p>“The Docking Fashion Reversed” is a brilliant example of such identity reversals at work. It refers to the practice both trendy and controversial in late nineteenth-century equestrian circles of removing (docking) a horse’s tail, often without anaesthetic and by less-than-professional means. The image appears in <em>Work Accomplished by the Toronto Humane Society</em>, a lengthy book published by that society in 1892.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> In it we find an inversion readily comparable to that of PETA. Here, a team of three horses in workmen’s clothing conducts the grim business of removing the leg of their human subject, under the supervision of a fourth equine onlooker, whose clothes suggest a man of another class, perhaps a veterinary doctor or, more likely, the fashion-conscious owner. Both in its inversion and its simplicity, the image is powerful. As with PETA’s RibFest display, it exposes the paradoxical attitudes and practices that rest at the heart of the human-animal nexus. The point I wish to make here, though, is that in broad strokes, “The Docking Fashion Reversed” is not much different from the purportedly radical work of PETA and other contemporary animal rights organizations: invert humans and animals via powerful, controversial visual images as a means to make the treatment of the latter as unsettling as possible. Keri Cronin discusses similarly violent images on the part of the nineteenth century’s more radical anti-vivisectionists, but the strategy informed even the mainstream movement and its respectable middle-class supporters.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Indeed, if we are to look for a difference, it rests in PETA’s addition of performance and of sexuality as attention-grabbers. Yet even here, similarities remain. Like their nineteenth-century counterparts, PETA’s strategists are aware of the line between the acceptable and the controversial, and they use that knowledge to provoke their audience. As James Turner points out, one of the key transformations to inform Victorian society when it came to the treatment of animals was the era’s heightened sensitivity regarding pain.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> Unlike PETA’s RibFest imagery, “The Docking Fashion Reversed” capitalizes on that sensitivity in spades.</p>
<p>So let’s not sell the modern animal rights movement’s predecessors short on strategy, on controversy, or on motivation. When it comes to the evolution of efforts to reshape human-nonhuman animal relations, the Victorians who framed much of the contemporary legal, policy, and NGO landscape around the treatment of animals lived like us in a complex world. The responses between then and now are not so different that it becomes useful to overlook the similarities that inform them. It is, I think, a far more profitable strategy to recognize the longevity of this movement than to reinvent it as a product of the recent past.</p>

They are cute, they are cuddly, they are sweet, and they want you out of the way. Next time you&#8217;re around a baby look in those sweet little baby eyes, you&#8217;ll see one thought: only a matter of time my friend.&#8221;</a> -Jerry Seinfeld</p>
<p>There is very little in this world that is truly inevitable. Taxes have always been said to be one of those things, but I recently heard that self-described smart people can avoid paying them, so that clears that up. One thing that we have not been able to escape, however, is death. Despite howls of protest from <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/683314/ELVIS-NOT-DEAD-Graceland-groundsman-filmed-THIS-MONTH-is-King-aged-81">Elvis fans</a> and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-belief-that-andy-kaufman-is-alive">Andy Kaufman truthers</a>, we all meet our end at some point, which as Jerry Seinfeld has taught us is met with joy by the baby community.</p>
<p>Even if we all have to die eventually, not all deaths are met equally by those left behind. Certain deaths capture the public&#8217;s attention more than others. Whether they be because of a person&#8217;s fame, the unexpectedness of the death, or the manner in which the person died. The wives of Henry VIII, for instance, have a mnemonic device that reminds us of their final acts. 2016 was, unfortunately, a seemingly never-ending reminder of how we can be caught off guard by news of someone&#8217;s passing.</p>
<p>In this episode of the History Slam, Aaron Boyes and I count down the 10 most shocking deaths from the 20th century. We give our rationale for what constitutes &#8216;shocking,&#8217; describe the events that made the list, and round out the episode by pointing out some that could have qualified.</p>

<p>It all happened sometime in late March 2003, during the first days of the invasion of Iraq. My then-roommate and I were watching CNN’s coverage of the Battle of Nasiriyah in our Vancouver living-room, when my friend suddenly decided to break the silence that had been reigning for about fifteen minutes. “I’m telling you, dude, there’s going to be a slew of protest songs, like in the 1960s and 1970s. All of those Kitsilano hippies must be loving it!” This observation was prophetic, as this discussion took place about a year and a half before the release of Green Day’s seminal <em>American Idiot</em>.</p>
<p>However, my friend was overly dismissive when I suggested that there existed a certain continuity, as far as protest songs were concerned, between the 1960s and the present, whether in America or in Europe. In his opinion, Bruce Springsteen’s “The River” (1980) and “Born in the USA” (1984) did not really express a rejection of the established order – to which I replied that I begged to differ. Granted, he had never listened to the Ramones’ 1985 “Bonzo Goes to Bitburg (My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down),” which mocked Ronald Reagan’s visit to Kolmeshöhe cemetary, in Bitburg, Germany, where several <em>Waffen</em>-SS members were buried; however, examples are not exactly lacking. In addition, my roommate showed himself even more antagonistic when I stated that the Right also had a long tradition of protest songs. He was also mistaken in that regard, as the Left has never enjoyed a monopoly over that particular genre.</p>
<p>The history of protest songs in France provides a good example, both of the prominence of this musical genre from the 1960s onwards, and of its less publicized use by rightwing artists.<span id="more-20937"></span> The socialist, communist, or anarchist Lefts have never experienced a dearth of politicized songwriters and musicians. The Cold War context, the painful, protracted decolonization of the French Empire, the growing regionalist movement, and, last but not least, changes in the musical industry, provided a fertile ground for the proliferation of protest songs in the 1960s-70s. Although the Americanization/Anglicization of Western Europe in the decades that followed the Second World War greatly contributed to the popularization of now quasi-deified figures such as Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Leonard Cohen, several politically inclined songwriters had emerged long before the aforementioned artists had any impact on the French musical scene. Most notably, the free-thinking, somewhat anarchist Georges Brassens caused several scandals by regularly insulting the Catholic Church (and, implicitly, all forms of organized religion), the military, the justice system, and other institutions from the early 1950s to his death in 1981. His first album, entitled <em>La Mauvaise réputation</em> (1952), included “Le Gorille,” which told the story of a judge raped by a gorilla after falling into a pit at the zoo. While the song might seem gratuitously crude at first, the final lines give it its reason for being – that of a plea against the death penalty:</p>
<p>For the judge, at the supreme moment<br />
Screamed “Mommy!”, crying a river,<br />
Like the man whose head, that very day,<br />
He had ordered be cut off.<br />
Beware the Gorilla![1]</p>
<p>Needless to say, “Le Gorille” was censored and not played on the radio until 1955.</p>

<p>While Brassens had only contempt for political organizations, Jean Ferrat made no secret of his communist sympathies – though he never adhered to the French Communist Party (PCF). Although, unlike Brassens, he only rarely resorted to saucy images, Ferrat regularly made waves by openly praising communism. Almost all of his albums include songs glorifying past revolutionary events – “Potemkine” (1965), “La Commune” (1971) – or diatribes against conservative politicians and intellectuals – “Un jeune” (1975), “Un air de liberté” (1975). Although he never directly praised the USSR, he explicitly showed his admiration for Fidel Castro’s regime in his 1967 album, entitled <em>À</em><em> Santiago</em> – the songs “Cuba si” and “Les Guérilleros” are, in that regard, unambiguous. Ferrat also set several of Louis Aragon’s poems to music. A World War Two resistance fighter and one of the PCF’s most prominent intellectuals, Aragon was for most of his life a staunch defender of the Soviet regime, and the poems which Ferrat chose to record all have highly political contents – “Un jour, un jour” (1967), “Les Poètes” (1969). However, Ferrat distanced himself from the PCF after the Warsaw Pact’s repression of the 1968 Prague Spring. His song “Camarade” (1969) unarguably contradicted the party’s blind, shameful support for Leonid Brezhnev’s USSR:</p>
<p>It’s a terrible word, Comrade,<br />
It’s a terrible word to say<br />
When, in the course of a masquerade,<br />
All it does is shudder.<br />
What are you doing, Comrade?<br />
What are you doing here?<br />
It was at 5:00 am in Prague<br />
That the August skies darkened,<br />
Comrade… Comrade</p>
<p>The message is not exactly arcane here.</p>
<p>The French tradition of protest songs did not lose steam in the 1980s, as older artists, like Ferrat, the radical leftist blueswoman Colette Magny, and the avowedly anarchist Léo Ferré remained active during that period. In addition to these, a new generation of artists had also emerged of the <em>dark</em>, crisis-ridden 1970s. Renaud, a product of the 1968 Revolution, and the more marginal Bérurier noir took up their elders’ antimilitaristic, anticlerical crusade. Like their predecessors, they had to face attempts to censor their work, and found themselves at the centre of controversy. Renaud’s “La médaille,” (1994) in which he referred to some unnamed Marshals of France as “murderers,” earned him a lawsuit from the ASAF (<em>Association de soutien à l’armée française</em> – Association for the support of the French Army), and Bérurier noir’s inflammatory lyrics and anarchist sympathies caught the attention of the police after a group named Black War claimed the April 1988 bombing of an administrative building. Fortunately, Renaud was eventually acquitted and Bérurier noir no longer suspected of aiding and abetting terrorist actions. One of France’s first major punk bands (along with Stalag), Bérurier noir also became famous for its anti-<em>Front national </em>song entitled “Porcherie,” whose final line (in live performances) <em>“[l]a jeunesse emmerde le Front national</em>” (“The youth says ‘fuck you’ to the National Front”) is to this day the closest thing to an anthem at radical and anarchist and generally leftwing rallies.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FpH0gre8AQw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>But the period stretching from (roughly) 1945 to 1989 also saw the emergence of several, albeit not as numerous, rightwing singer-songwriters. Here, one should distinguish generally conservative artists (Johnny Halliday, Patrick Bruel, Françoise Hardy, or Line Renaud) from those who have been wearing their politics on their sleeves, like Michel Sardou or Serge Lama. It is also paramount not to lump the latter with the proponents of ultranationalist, traditionalist, and authoritarian ideas. Among these, Jean-Pax Méfret is notable for his staying power. Born in French Algeria in 1944, Méfret had to leave for France in the wake of the Algerian War (1954-62). Like many other <em>Pieds-Noirs</em> (Black Feet is the name given to the former European settlers in Algeria, Morocco, or Tunisia), he has harboured a strong nostalgia for what he feels is his true homeland. Nevertheless, Méfret’s songs do not confine themselves to reflecting his longing for Algeria, as they unmistakably take generally pro-imperialistic, pro-militaristic, or nationalistic stances. Most notably, his “Hymne des Pieds-noirs” (1968) and “Le loup de guerre” (1980) display an unabashed admiration for France’s colonial past (and present). Despite his limited presence in the mainstream media, Méfret regularly fills concert halls and enjoys a certain cult following, mostly in far-right circles.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52IJlRD78jk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Also on the right of the spectrum, but certainly not as reactionary and far more popular than Méfret, Michel Sardou has consistently attacked leftwing intellectuals and politicians for their anti-Americanism – “Les Ricains” (1967) – or their alleged Bolshevik tendencies – “<em>Vladimir Ilitch</em>” (1983). Although some of his songs do not register as <em>pure</em> protest songs, as they side with the powers-that-be, they do have trappings similar to those of <em>oppositional</em> ones. Among his pro-status quo songs, “Je suis pour” (1976) is one of the most virulent. “Je suis pour,” which came out in the context of the high-profile Patrick Henry murder trial, argues for the maintenance of the death penalty. The song elicited strong reactions, especially on the Left, as it came out at a time of high polarization between opponents and proponents of the death penalty – which was abolished in 1981, after François Mitterrand was elected President. More than Sardou’s stance itself, it was certainly the violent, bloodthirsty nature of the lyrics that sparked the controversy:</p>
<p>You robbed me of my child,<br />
Shed the blood of my blood.<br />
No God can appease me.<br />
I shall have your head! You shall perish!<br />
Both compassion and fear<br />
You have ripped from my heart.<br />
You no longer need a lawyer.<br />
I shall have your head! You shall perish!</p>
<p>Sardou’s subsequent albums were slightly more politically correct, though still resolutely conservative – “Les Deux Écoles” (1984), against the Socialist government’s project to further secularize the educational system – and sometimes speckled with populist, borderline racist, outbursts – “Ils ont le pétrole, mais c&#8217;est tout” (1979).</p>
<p>However, artists of Méfret’s and Sardou’s ilk have been less prominent since the end of the Cold War. As for the neo-fascist punk and black metal scenes, they have remained peripheral, underground phenomena. The 1990s was marked by the popularization of politically active rap and pop/rock artists. Among the most notable rap bands, IAM, Assassin, and NTM have repeatedly warned their audiences of the rise of the <em>Front national</em> and emphasized the need for deghettoization and, more generally, social justice. Twenty years after its release, the Marseille-based IAM’s “L’Empire du Côté Obscur” (1997) sounds frighteningly prophetic, as it describes, by allegorizing the Star Wars saga, the <em>Front national</em>’s progress in their hometown and region.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CW4PtgKDc1k" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>About six months before the release of “L’Empire du Côté Obscur,” Noir Désir’s “Un jour en France” – one of the musically and lyrically brilliant <em>6</em><em>66.667 Club</em>’s big hits – had also noted the growing popularity of Jean-Marie Le Pen’s party, now enjoying the support of “a few quasi-fascists amounting to approximately 15%.” But the band, which did not conceal its sympathies for the peripheral but then-promising Trotskyist LCR (<em>Ligue communiste révolutionnaire</em>), also vilified the EU’s neoliberal policies. Worthy of note is also the inclusion, in “Un jour en France,” of a reference to <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>’s petition for the outlawing of the Front national – another example (among many others) that contradicts the many accusations (mostly in the British, American, and Canadian press) that the <a href="http://activehistory.ca/2015/01/whowhat-really-is-charlie/">weekly held profoundly racist views</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCN3Ri0VYV8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, this post would not be complete without a mention of Zebda’s “Le bruit et l’odeur” (1995), whose title sarcastically refers to the freshly elected Jacques Chirac’s racist comments on “the noise and smell” allegedly coming out of immigrant families’ households, and of Les Wampas’ incendiary “Chirac en prison” (2006), calling for the conviction of the then-President of France for misappropriation of funds and untrustworthiness.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>French protest songs provide a good indicator of social and political tensions from the 1950s onwards. In addition, they contrast with their counterparts in Canada and, to some extent, in the USA. Indeed, the more aggressive French lyrical tradition, often ridden with <em>ad hominem</em> attacks, reflects the political dynamic of conflict that has prevailed in France for the last two centuries. While some Canadian artists have evoked political issues (Neil Young, The Tragically Hip, etc.), they have usually remained within what could be termed “the space of polite consensus.” Whether the lyrical content is radical or not, it rarely fully steps into the realm of partisan politics. In that regard, Leonard Cohen’s interpretation of “The Partisan” (recorded in 1969, originally written in 1943 by the French Second World War resister Emmanuel d&#8217;Astier de La Vigerie) is quite emblematic of these differences, as the French lyrics speak unequivocally of “the Germans” as the enemy and of the need for national liberation, while the English verse is much more abstract:</p>
<p>Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing<br />
Through the graves the wind is blowing<br />
Freedom soon will come<br />
Then we&#8217;ll come from the shadows</p>
<p>Thus, two irreconcilable approaches to politics can be found within the same song: one based on consensus, and the other on conflict. As for the future of American protest songs, it is probably bright, given the latest developments south of the border.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Krista McCracken</em></p>
<p>Over the past six years, while working at the Shingwauk Residential Schools Centre, I’ve seen a significant growth of awareness among students and community groups about the history residential schools.  Granted, this awareness can still be hit and miss and there are definitely still many misconceptions about residential schools, however an increasing number of visitors come to the Centre with at least some knowledge about residential schools.</p>
<p>The same cannot be said for the <a href="http://apihtawikosisan.com/2012/04/the-stolen-generations/">sixties scoop</a>. While discussing residential schools and colonial relationships in Canada I often discuss other legislation which has negatively impacted Indigenous communities and this includes talking about the sixties scoop.</p>
<p>The phrase sixties scoop was first used in the 1983 report <em>Native Children and the Child Welfare System </em>written by Patrick Johnston. The <a href="http://www.firstnationsdrum.com/2009/03/the-sixties-scoop-how-canadas-best-intentions-proved-catastrophic/">term refers to the mass removal of Indigenous children</a> from their families into the child welfare system. This removal was often done without the consent of families or communities and children were frequently placed in white Euro-Canadian homes.</p>

<p>The legacy of residential schools is directly connected to the sixties scoop. In 1960 the <a href="https://fncaringsociety.com/publications/native-children-child-welfare-and-colonization-native-people">Government of Canada estimated</a> that 50% of the students in the residential school system were there for ‘child welfare’ reasons. As the government began phasing out the residential school system the practice of removing Indigenous children from their homes and placing them in government care was <a href="https://fncaringsociety.com/sites/default/files/docs/FirstNationsFS1.pdf">drastically accelerated</a>.<span id="more-20944"></span> Provincial and territorial governments, which often had no understanding of Indigenous systems of care or ways of life,  imposed Euro-Canadian standards of care on communities, often resulting in Indigenous homes being deemed ‘unfit’ for children. The <a href="http://data2.archives.ca/e/e448/e011188230-03.pdf">1996 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples reported</a> that between 1960 and 1990 11,132 status First Nation children were placed in white, middle-class family homes.</p>
<p>The removal of children from their families and placement in white family homes had long term impacts that continue to be felt today. The <a href="http://journals.sfu.ca/fpcfr/index.php/FPCFR/article/view/25/63">sixties scoop had a negative impact</a> on personal and community based Indigenous culture, language, and identity.  The process of adopting out has lasting impacts on family structures and community relationships and has been associated with a range of mental health and socialization problems. Additionally the negative involvement of social work agencies during the sixties scoop has been <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801204266312">described as a continuation of residential school style assimilation and as cultural genocide</a>.</p>
<p>On February 14, 2017 <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/article34017005.ece/BINARY/Brown+v+AG+Canada+summary+judgment+FINAL.pdf">an Ontario judge sided with sixties scoop survivors</a>, finding that the government was liable to thousands of Indigenous people in Ontario who were removed from their families and adopted out as part of the sixties scoop. This ruling, as well as ongoing litigation in other provinces, represents some of the ongoing discussion and advocacy around the sixties scoop.</p>
<p>In 2015 <em><a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf">Honouring the Truth, Reconciliation for the Future</a>, </em>the final report summary of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, noted that “[t]oo many Canadians know little or nothing about the deep historical roots of these conflicts” (p. 8). The summary also highlighted that the over representation of Indigenous children in the child welfare system continues today.</p>
<p>Scholars have noted that the sixties scoop has simply evolved into the millennium scoop. Indigenous children are still over represented in the child welfare system and First Nation children living on reserves receive significantly less child welfare services funding. There are presently <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/native-children-in-care-surpass-residential-school-era-1.677743">more Indigenous children in care</a> then there were during the height of the residential school era.</p>
<p>In 2007 the Assembly of First Nations and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada took the case of Canada’s treatment of Indigenous children in care before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In 2013 a formal tribunal was established to look into this case and on <a href="http://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/blackstock-one-year-later-liberals-still-discriminate-against-first-nations-children">January 26, 2016 the tribunal ruled</a> that the Canadian government was racially discriminating against 163,000 First Nations Children. Despite this ruling government funding models and legislation have been slow to change.</p>
<p>So how as historians and educators can we raise awareness about this chapter of Canada’s history?</p>
<ol>
<li>Teach about the sixties scoop alongside residential schools.  Understand that residential schools are just one part of a larger colonial system that was designed to assimilate Indigenous people.</li>
<li>Incorporate discussions of the sixties scoop into child and youth history classes.</li>
<li>Foster relationships with sixties scoop survivors and invite them into your classroom to talk about their lived experience. Alternatively use <a href="http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/deepeningknowledge/Teacher_Resources/Curriculum_Resources_(by_subjects)/Social_Sciences_and_Humanities/Sixties_Scoop.html">video, audio, or written testimony</a> to centre Indigenous voices in your classroom discussion.</li>
<li>Acknowledge that the legacy of the sixties scoop and colonialism is still being felt in Indigenous communities today.</li>
<li>Address the millennium scoop and ongoing child welfare and education inequality in the classroom.</li>
</ol>
<p>Historians and educators are beginning to do a much better job of discussing and addressing residential schools in the classroom.  However there is a need to acknowledge that residential schools are just one piece in a much larger history of colonialism in Canada.</p>

<p><strong>“She screamed violently and made resistance”: Chloe Cooley and Slavery in Canada </strong><strong>Remember | Resist | Redraw:</strong><strong> Poster #02</strong></p>
<p><em>Poster by Naomi Moyer</em></p>
<p><em> Introduction by Funké Aladejebi</em></p>
<p>While little is known about Chloe Cooley, she is often remembered as the reason behind Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe’s push towards the abolition of slavery in Upper Canada. Vehemently resisting her treatment and impending sale, Cooley represented a loud and unabashed articulation of black womanhood that served to disrupt conceptions of freedom and equality in Canada.</p>
<p>Within the historical narrative, Canada is often constructed as &#8220;Canaan land,&#8221; a place where enslaved African Americans found freedom and escaped the brutality of slavery in the United States. However, Canada had its own history of slavery and racial separation that highlighted the long historical presence of African descended peoples within the nation. Beginning with the earliest recorded enslaved person in Canada in 1628, an estimated 4,000 Panis (Indigenous) and Black slaves were bought, sold, and exploited in colonial Canada. Their experiences exposed the complex and tenuous nature of freedom and enslavement in Canada.</p>
<p>Chloe Cooley’s treatment at the hands of her owner, William Vrooman reflected the unjust and brutal nature of slavery in Canada. Residing near Queenston, Niagara Falls, William Vrooman was a Loyalist from New York who wanted to sell Cooley across the Niagara River to the United States on the eve of 14 March 1793. Resisting her transport, Chloe Cooley caused so much disruption that it took three men to restrain her. Witnesses testified that “she screamed violently, and made resistance, but was tied&#8230;” (William Renwick Riddell, 1924). Despite her defiance, Cooley was later delivered to a man down the river bank never to be seen again.</p>
<p>The seizure and sale of Chloe Cooley created much controversy among Upper Canadians, many of whom were appalled by Vrooman’s conduct. Despite attempts to prevent the abolition of slavery by several white colonial administrators, Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe would use Cooley’s story to agitate and mobilize Upper Canada’s growing abolitionist community. The result was T<em>he 1793 Act to Limit Slavery in Upper Canada</em> which led to the gradual abolition of slavery in Canada. Although the Act itself did not immediately free any slaves, it did restrict the importation of any new slaves into Upper Canada and ensured the freedom of any persons born into slavery at the age of twenty-five. Furthermore, any children born into this cohort would subsequently be free. The Act became an important legislative gain in the fight against slavery in Upper Canada until 1833 when slavery was abolished across the British Empire.</p>
<p>Because Black women’s bodies were intertwined in the labour, domestic work, and childbearing practices of enslavement in Canada, Chloe Cooley’s refusal to yield to her bondage signalled the racial and gendered strategies utilized by Black women within the restrictive and violent confines of enslavement. Contesting the patriarchal nature of slavery in Canada, Chloe Cooley’s life and loud protest stood as a reminder of the resistance and presence of African descended peoples on the Canadian landscape</p>

As marijuana dispensaries emerge from informal networks towards formal supply chains shaped by storefronts and licensed growers, marijuana growers and retailers will increasingly have to sell their product on the basis of quality, cleanliness, and standardization. The process of formalizing the marijuana market has some intriguing parallels to the efforts of Canadian producers and manufacturers to create formal, standardized categories for tobacco at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The tobacco precedent suggests that rigorous standards present a major threat to smaller producers who may see opportunity in the emerging legal marijuana market.</p>
<p>Canadian manufacturers and agricultural modernizers sought to form a tobacco industry from the precedents set by Indigenous peoples, as well as the strong <em>tabac canadien</em> that had been raised by French-Canadian farmers in small garden plots. Racist metrics of quality and expertise caused colonial Canadian farmers and manufacturers to largely reject Indigenous tobacco cultivation practices, beyond acknowledging them as a precedent to legitimize tobacco farming in Canada or using racist images of Indigenous peoples, such as the “Cigar store Indian,” to evoke a sense of timelessness for their products.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>In doing this, Canadian tobacco interests, combined with a federal interest in both regulating and promoting Canadian tobacco for tax and export purposes, gradually conformed to a rigorous classification for tobacco, based on leaf size, colouration, curing methods, and other factors. A tobacco farmer didn’t simply grow tobacco; they grew burley, flue-cured, or cigar tobacco, and even then, a wide range of varieties were selected based on flavour, germination period, resistance to pests, and so on. The tobacco farmer’s success was then judged by the manufacturer, or later, at tobacco auctions, which had complicated grading systems. By the 1960s, a farmer’s tobacco crop was adjudicated by over 60 government-regulated grades, based on colour, leaf location and damage, cure, and other factors.</p>
<p><span id="more-20927"></span>This tendency towards highly regulated, complexly-adjudicated tobacco contributed to the rise of specialized tobacco plantations, requiring considerable capital investment for curing, fertilizers, seed, greenhouses, and labour. The era of small scale tobacco production, where farmers might devote an acre or two of land to tobacco as a side-venture and sell their production directly from farmers&#8217; markets, largely closed.  As marijuana further legalizes, the scale at which it is grown will undoubtedly grow.</p>
<p>Further, the language of tobacco quality came to be largely shaped by major tobacco corporations and their infamous campaigns, from “<a href="https://www.mydiscountcigarette.net/info/more-doctors-smoke-camels-posters">More Doctors Smoke Camels</a>” to Imperial Tobacco’s Picobac Tobacco, “Grown in Sunny, Southern Ontario.” The Picobac reference to place and geography will undoubtedly be replicated by sellers of a geographically influenced product like marijuana (the high quality of “B.C. Bud” is long renowned). Perhaps like Coors’ use of the Rocky Mountains, large companies might someday run national campaigns evoking the natural purity of their product source.</p>
<p>Given the current federal initiative to legalize marijuana use, marijuana growers are facing a similarly complex grading and regulatory regime. The <a href="http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/task-force-marijuana-groupe-etude/framework-cadre/index-eng.php#a3.2">Final Report of the Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation</a>, issued in October 2016, made this clear in their section on Production. It recommended that the government be vigorously involved in regulating the tobacco supply chain to enforce a variety of quality, security, and health standards. Laboratory testing for the THC (the active hallucinogenic property of marijuana) and CBD (seen as <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2016/biology-potential-therapeutic-effects-cannabidiol">potentially therapeutic</a>, with no psychoactive affects) amounts and clear labelling of those quantities is recommended.</p>
<p>To regulate the production of cannabis, the federal report also recommended that, beyond monitoring THC and CBD levels, that laboratory testing of commercial marijuana also ensures that licensed products “meet specific quality standards” and that regulations further “the good production practices of the current cannabis for medical purposes system.” Translating that, we might expect that the diverse and informal marijuana market will shrink significantly. Rigorous regulation also gradually cut into the informal tobacco market. While there will always be demand for pot from informal channels (to avoid federal taxation, for instance), it seems reasonable to expect that licensed producers, with regulated standards of quality, will dominate.</p>
<p>Just as tobacco varieties were increasingly controlled and defined, marketing opportunity will contribute to defining marijuana strains. There is already considerable interest among marijuana consumers to know what strain of pot they are purchasing. People looking for a more energizing high might turn to a mix featuring buds from the <em>Cannabis sativa </em>plant. Those looking for a more sedative experience might prefer a mixture featuring <em>Cannabis indica</em>. A variety of hybrid blends featuring elements of both plants also exist. A review by Ernest Small of the Science and Technology Branch, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, notes that “clandestine breeders” have been selecting and promoting particular qualities of <em>Cannabis sativa</em> plants for decades, including fostering shorter, conical plants that both produce more narcotic-containing foliage and flowers, and were easier to hide. The underground nature of much marijuana production has greatly complicated the classification of marijuana types, and Small indicates that there is considerable complexity and debate in how cannabis plants can actually be classified. For instance, “there has been a fundamental confusion in much of the popular literature over what the terms “sativa” and “indica” designate.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Classification matters because it provides a ready means to enable a language of connoisseurship. For tobacco, this meant that any type of tobacco that adhered to or lacked standards of burnability, taste, texture, and colour could be dismissed as inferior or praised as superior by adjudicators of taste (such as magazine authors, corporate buyers, or consumers). Classification got to the point where tobacco that failed to meet those standards would essentially be dismissed as not tobacco, but as “Nondescript” leaf in Canada. Smith Falls, Ontario’s <a href="https://www.tweed.com/#oht:lang=en-us">Tweed Farms</a> promises product “as diverse as the customers that use them,” but still carefully classify their offerings based on strain, THC and CBD levels, and other measurable factors, closely resembling the Task Force’s recommendations.   The tobacco case illustrates that these categories can also be readily used by large corporations and culturally powerful connoisseurs to define quality and pressure smaller producers.</p>
<p>Classification also matters as firms seek to patent or promote particular marijuana strains. For instance, British-based GW Pharmaceuticals has patented a number of marijuana selections. The potential for further patenting and rigorous classification offers a challenge to the Final Report’s aim of maintaining “a diverse, competitive market that also includes small producers” through its regulations. As patents and growing expertise for adjudicating marijuana grow, the potential for large capitalist interests to shape the market grows. One <a href="https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/waiting-for-the-opportune-moment-the-tobacco-industry-and-marijuana-legalization/">study</a>, drawing on released internal memos, found that Big Tobacco’s interest in marijuana has extended back into the 1970s. The costs associated with developing and patenting particular varietals of marijuana, combined with the tobacco’s industry’s success in developing and enforcing particular standards of quality for tobacco products, suggests that marijuana will be a prime target for tobacco firms.</p>
<p>The tobacco case gives us a framework for monitoring the gradual national legalization and regulation of marijuana. Government policy makers must recognize that historical precedents indicate that there are significant pressures favoring corporate takeovers and amalgamation. Regulatory tools for monitoring an industry, such as formal, standard categories, contributed to the concentration of tobacco farming and industry in Canada. If the Task Force call to protect small producers is serious, regulators are going to have to anticipate and counter strong forces seeking to combine small producers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.seankheraj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SeanVR-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1896" src="http://www.seankheraj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SeanVR-1-1024x591.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="591" /></a><em>Sean Kheraj</em></p>
<p>For the past year, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about virtual reality and its potential applications for historians. Can we use virtual reality to better understand the past? Can the experience of virtual reality alter historical thinking? Can we now build time machines, teleporters, and holodecks using virtual reality?</p>
<p>These questions may be overly optimistic or idealistic. I may look back on this article a year from now and shake my head and chuckle at my naive enthusiasm for this technology. But for now, VR has got me thinking about the future of history.</p>
<p>VR stands apart from other multimedia technologies primarily because of its ability to generate a sense of presence. Thomas B. Sheridan describes this as a <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/pres.1992.1.1.120#.WKxVLFXytEY" target="_blank">&#8220;sense of being physically present with visual, auditory, or force displays generated by a computer.&#8221;</a> He proposed three measurable physical variables to determine what he called &#8220;telepresence&#8221; and &#8220;virtual presence&#8221;: (1) extent of sensory information; (2) control of relation of sensors to environment; and (3) ability to modify physical environment. Does VR have the potential to generate a sense of the presence of the past?<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a></p>
<p>John Bonnett&#8217;s concluding remarks in his <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jahc;view=text;rgn=main;idno=3310410.0006.202" target="_blank">2003 article on the 3D Virtual Buildings Project</a> in <i>Journal of the Association for History and Computing </i>suggest that I&#8217;m not alone in my enthusiasm. He wrote, &#8220;3D environments are instruments, and if properly exploited they stand to provide historians with substantial gains in their capacity to teach, represent and analyze the past.&#8221; Remarkably, Bonnett&#8217;s outlook on the future of 3D environments predicted some of the most recent developments in virtual reality and augmented reality technologies:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this vision of computing, users in near future will wear computers with the computational power of today&#8217;s desktops, and the size of today&#8217;s personal digital assistants. These computers, in turn, will be connected to wireless networks to access and post information, and to head mounted displays the size of glasses to display information. I mention this newly emerging field because it is already making a contribution to the way we represent the past, and the way we tell stories. In principle, it should be possible in the next 10 to 20 years to produce something akin to the holodeck from Star Trek. We will not be able to interact with objects without the mediation of glasses or gloves. But we should be able to generate representations of ancient Rome or 19th century Paris, and project them onto football fields.fields.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[ii]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Smartphones with stereoscopic viewers (<a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/" target="_blank">Google Cardboard</a>, <a href="https://madeby.google.com/vr/" target="_blank">Daydream View</a>, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/" target="_blank">Gear VR</a>) and tethered VR/AR headsets like the <a href="https://www.vive.com/ca/" target="_blank">HTC Vive</a>, <a href="https://www.oculus.com/" target="_blank">Oculus Rift</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-ca" target="_blank">Microsoft HoloLens</a> have brought us closer to that holodeck-like experience. Immersing yourself in a 3D representation of nineteenth-century Paris is not a fantasy. It can be done now.</p>
<p>In this article, I&#8217;d like to show some examples of how VR can be used today to, in Bonnett&#8217;s words, &#8220;teach, represent and analyze the past.&#8221;<span id="more-20915"></span></p>
<h3>Teach the Past</h3>
<p>Virtual reality, like many other technologies before it, holds the potential to enhance history education. VR headset manufacturers and application developers have already been pushing the idea of using this technology for teaching. Microsoft has focused its early attention on medical education.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKpKlh1-en0?showinfo=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Google is not far behind and already offers an introductory VR education product called, <a href="https://edu.google.com/expeditions/" target="_blank">Google Expeditions</a>. Using Google&#8217;s relatively inexpensive Cardboard headsets, teachers can guide students on virtual field trips. Students can be teleported to historic sites around the world and view them through Cardboard headsets.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3MQ9yG_QfDA?showinfo=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Using spherical photography, Google has captured VR images of historic sites all over the world. This includes UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as the <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/angkor/" target="_blank">Angkor Archaeological Park</a> in Cambodia. Through Google Maps and Street View, users can explore the temples of the ancient city of Angkor:</p>
<p><center><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1487688191121!6m8!1m7!1shDA9mxAqLm-VEiftT_AOiQ!2m2!1d13.41294646775198!2d103.8676404063325!3f233.19414592349594!4f8.188938070584584!5f0.7820865974627469" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Viewing these images in a VR headset can be arresting. The ability to &#8220;take&#8221; our students to these historic sites is a powerful example of the potential of VR for history education.</p>
<h3> Represent the Past</h3>
<p>The public history applications of VR are ample and many institutions and organizations have already begun to experiment with the technology. There are now several short historical documentaries shot in spherical video on YouTube. With a VR headset, users are placed within the video. For instance, this short video takes viewers into the buildings and rooms of Bletchley Park to tell the history of code breaking during the Second World War and the work of Alan Turing and others:</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlWVpOzgrL4?showinfo=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Last summer, <em>New York Times</em> produced an impressive immersive VR video of the history of the Olympic Games with 3D reconstructions of stadiums from 1896 (Athens), 1932 (Los Angeles), 1968 (Mexico City), and 2008 (Beijing). Viewers stand in the middle of these stadiums as historical images from past Olympic Games surround them and oral histories with athletes play along with narration:</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcsev4e9DoI?showinfo=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>While these videos may just be another medium for representing history to broad public audiences, the capability of VR technology to generate a sense of presence and situate those audiences within past environments represents something different.</p>
<h3>Analyze the Past</h3>
<p>With VR technology, scholars may now be able to use that sense of presence to analyze history in new ways. Textual and visual documents along with oral accounts have been the primary sources historians use to access fragments of the past. They provide us with documentation and evidence about the past, but to what extent can they convey a sense of presence? Historians have used other methods to recreate the materiality of the past from food historians using historical recipes to the use of 3D printers to recreate objects from the past. Spherical photography and 3D virtual environments may provide historians with new ways of analyzing the past through presence.</p>
<p>Once again, we can draw from the enormous spherical photography archive of Google Street View to begin to see the future potential of VR for historical analysis. Google recently created a tool within Street View to allow users to <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2014/04/go-back-in-time-with-street-view.html" target="_blank">&#8220;travel to the past&#8221;</a> by accessing images from the past decade of the Street View project. In effect, Google has created a massive spherical re-photography project. For instance, users can view the transformation of the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ErJdHHJEnBU2" target="_blank">World Trade Center site in Manhattan</a> from 2007 to 2016:</p>

<p>Historians can now travel ten years into the past and experience a sense of presence with this tool. This type of primary source and the ability to stand in the past isn&#8217;t limited to twenty-first century photography. Historical panoramic photographs from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries can also be viewed in VR. Although these images are not spherical, they can still give the viewer a sense of presence by wrapping around the viewer&#8217;s head within the VR headset. For example, the City of Vancouver Archives has a number of outstanding high-resolution panoramic photographs like this one from <a href="http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/view-of-shaughnessy-heights-from-matthews-and-wolfe-avenues" target="_blank">Shaughnessy Heights in 1911</a>:</p>
<div style="width: 17248px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/uploads/r/null/8/7/872083/e55c7857-14f4-46f5-83d4-b455704426e4-A65563.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/uploads/r/null/8/7/872083/e55c7857-14f4-46f5-83d4-b455704426e4-A65563.jpg" width="17238" height="3000" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View of Shaughnessy Heights from Matthews and Wolfe Avenues, 1911</p></div>
<p>Using <a href="http://fulldive.com/" target="_blank">Full Dive</a>, a mobile VR app, the panorama can be stretched and wrapped around the viewer to recreate the view of the photographer standing in the middle of the clearcut forest and future site of suburban development in Vancouver:</p>
<div id="attachment_1895" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.seankheraj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screenshot_2017-02-21-11-19-31.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1895" src="http://www.seankheraj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screenshot_2017-02-21-11-19-31-1024x576.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of VR view of historical panorama</p></div>
<p>The experience of viewing a historical panorama in a VR headset can be powerful. It can generate a sense of presence. Or is this just an illusion? Is this just a twenty-first century stereoscope?</p>
<p>Finally, VR has expanded the possibility for interacting with 3D models, the type that Bonnett described in his 2003 article. Here the possibilities are astounding. Bonnett sketched out a vision for a massive crowd-sourced historical 3D modelling project, one that was not technologically feasible in 2003. Today, such a project does exist in <a href="https://sketchfab.com/" target="_blank">SketchFab</a>.</p>
<p>SketchFab is an online community for sharing 3D objects and environments. Users can share, view, and interact with 3D objects in a web browser. More impressively, these objects can be viewed in VR directly from the browser. While the collections in SketchFab include a wide range of objects, there are incredible collections of reconstructed historical artifacts, buildings, and environments.</p>
<p>Take for instance the work of the <a href="http://arck-project.com/" target="_blank">Arc/k Project</a>, a non-profit group that uses crowd-sourced photographs and photogrammetry to reconstruct cultural heritage sites that people have destroyed. Recently, they have worked to virtually reconstruct ancient Roman sites in Palmyra, Syria which ISIS destroyed. Users can now use VR headsets to walk through and explore the third-century <a href="https://sketchfab.com/models/38315a821d0342a5a1189a7144f18b25" target="_blank">Arch of Triumph</a>, destroyed in October 2015:</p>

<p>The possibilities of VR for historians are exciting and certainly worth further exploration and critical analysis. Are these examples simply flashy gimmicks or do they represent future tools for history educators, public historians, and scholars? There are clearly some current applications of VR for history. Through our teaching and scholarship, we may find more ways to use presence to better understand the past.</p>

<p>From September to October 2016, members of the Toronto Police conducted a six-week undercover investigation in Marie Curtis Park, located in the city’s west end.  72 people were charged with engaging in sexual acts.  Police Constable Kevin Ward has argued “<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/11/19/marie-curtis-park-becomes-centre-point-of-debate-about-public-space.html">it is a multi-faceted issue</a>,” linking park sex with sex offenders, drugs, and alcohol.  Although 95 percent of those charged are men, police contend that sexuality was not the primary factor.  The problem is that there is a history of police unapologetically targeting men having sex with men in Toronto’s parks.</p>
<p>In September 1968, as the government of Pierre Trudeau was contemplating changes to the regulation of homosexuality, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police held their annual meeting.  They were overwhelmingly opposed to reform, proclaiming “there is too great an erosion of our moral principles.”  Echoing the idea that this is a ‘multi-faceted issue,’ they argued “the search for homosexuals for partners often leads to assault, theft, male prostitution and murder.”  Despite these fears, one year later, Trudeau’s Omnibus Bill was in effect.</p>
<p>The change to the law regulating homosexuality in the Omnibus Bill was merely a <a href="http://activehistory.ca/2016/03/bath-raid-victims-should-also-be-pardoned/">partial decriminalization</a>.  Gross indecency, the provision outlawing gay sex, was not removed from the Criminal Code.  Rather, the Omnibus Bill added an “exception clause,” which allowed adults over 21 years old to be grossly indecent, provided they did so in private, and that only two people were present.  Queer activist Tim McCaskell noted, “all that Criminal Code amendments had done was to recognize the obvious.  The state could scarcely effectively surveil all the bedrooms of the nation.”  Using the loophole created by the exception clause, the police mobilized to charge men with gross indecency in spaces outside of the bedroom, namely, bathhouses, washrooms, and parks.  The limitations of the 1969 reform were highlighted by a group of queer activists on Parliament Hill in August 1971.  This protest was dubbed <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-first-gay-march">“We Demand.”</a></p>
<p>In 1971, Philosopher’s Walk, a pathway behind the Royal Ontario Museum connecting Bloor Street and Queen’s Park, was known as a gay cruising spot.  <span id="more-20869"></span>A volunteer with the Community Homophile Association of Toronto (CHAT) strolled through this path on a summer night.  <a href="https://archive.org/stream/bodypolitic01toro#page/n9/mode/2up">He witnessed two men being “jumped from behind”</a> by undercover police agents, who arrested them on charges of gross indecency. The CHAT volunteer formed a one-man organization called the Toronto Civilian Park Patrol.  He found three groups: men looking for gay sex, uniformed officers with the Toronto police, and undercover officers with the Toronto police. He quickly noticed that with so many people standing around not having sex, Philosopher’s Walk began to lose its allure, though this path and the connecting Queen’s Park were subject to undercover police surveillance through the 1970s and beyond.</p>

<p>High Park was another site of police surveillance.  During the summer of 1973, police officers patrolled the park and approached single men to ask if they had ever been convicted of gross indecency.  If the individual was honest and answered yes, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/bodypolitic09toro#page/4/mode/2up">the officer charged him with vagrancy</a>.  Community activists were becoming increasingly aware that police were using lesser charges to elicit a guilty plea.  Fearing the humiliation of a trial, and the cost of legal representation, most of these men pleaded guilty and walked away with a conviction, as well as a police record.  To combat this, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/bodypolitic05toro#page/6/mode/2up">CHAT formed a court worker program</a> that provided free legal assistance to anyone charged for having gay sex.  Despite this effort, many men continued to plead guilty.  In August 1977, Bruce Davidson was walking through High Park “and noticed a man in shorts, with his shirt open, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/bodypolitic46toro#page/4/mode/2up">lying on a park bench stroking himself</a>.”  This stimulating scenario worked, but as Davidson approached, the man identified himself as a police agent and charged him with indecent assault.  Davidson ultimately pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.</p>

<p>Historian Steven Maynard has examined “the struggle over public urban space” in the early 20th century.  Allan Gardens was one of the sites in which sex between men was subject to police surveillance.  Maynard demonstrates that the location of Allan Gardens near the working-class neighbourhood of Cabbagetown made this a prime location for both gay sex and police entrapment.  In the 1970s, the proximity of Allan Gardens to the emerging queer community meant this legacy continued.  In the summer of 1979 Andrew Britton walked into Allan Gardens late one night and went to an area with trees and bushes located near the park’s greenhouses.  He noticed that there were several men sitting around and milling about, including a man named Alan McMurray, whom he did not yet know.  The two made eye contact and walked into the bushes.  Britton stated “we’d hardly had a chance even to say anything to each other before we both became aware of a couple of men peering at us through the bushes.”  <a href="https://archive.org/stream/bodypolitic56toro#page/26/mode/2up">These men were police agents</a>, who charged Britton and McMurray with gross indecency.  They fought their charges, and won due to a reasonable doubt as to whether the officer witnessed anything indecent.</p>

The benches, trees, and bushes behind the greenhouse made for a popular spot in the 1970s.</p></div>
<p>One of the most shocking instances of police surveillance during this period was in David Balfour Park.  With winding paths and ravines, this space was ideal for gay cruising during late summer nights.  In August 1980, ‘Don’ took a late-night stroll through the park and saw a group of men gathered in a dark clearing, and he went to join them.  As soon as he arrived, “there was a sudden burst of light and the sound of a gun firing – twice.”  This warning was followed by a third shot.  One of the other men arrested, Tony, recalled that the third bullet “whizzed past his ear,” and that “it sounded really close.  <a href="https://archive.org/stream/bodypolitic67toro#page/12/mode/2up">I could smell the gunpowder</a>.”  Five men were charged with gross indecency and indecent acts.  At trial, it was revealed that plainclothes police agent, Richard Dionne, was responsible for discharging his firearm three times into the ground.  Dionne claimed he used his gun because he felt threatened.  The five men were ultimately convicted and given an absolute discharge after being scolded for their sex acts by the judge.</p>

<p>In the wake of the violent mass arrest during the February 5<sup>th</sup>, 1981 bathhouse raids, the community was determined to end these dangerous police operations.  Inspired in part by the CHAT court worker program, a group called the Right to Privacy Committee (RTPC) was formed to organize the legal defence of those charged in the raids.  This group worked with lawyers from the Law Union of Ontario and they were successful on an unprecedented scale: 87% of the 286 bathhouse patrons either had their charges withdrawn, or were acquitted at trial.  After the bath raid trials concluded in 1982, the RTPC formed a new organization called Gay Court Watch.  This group expanded their mandate to include anyone charged for having consensual sex, including in public parks.</p>
<p>After the bath raids, the city commissioned law journalist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6G7gHC4bHo">Arnold Bruner</a> to conduct an official inquiry into the relationship between the gay community and police.  He investigated the issue of policing public parks, and revealed that heterosexual “lovers’ lanes” were common, but due to the shame associated with gay sex, men seeking men were the easy targets for police surveillance.  Bruner noted that policing the parks was a serious community concern, and thus one of the key recommendations of his report was “that a moratorium be placed on arrests of persons suspected of engaging in sex in public parks.”</p>
<p>The location of the current battle over sex in public spaces, Marie Curtis Park, was not immune to the Toronto morality police of the 1970s and 1980s.  In the summer of 1982, two men were arrested “by plainclothes officers posing as gay men and were charged with indecent assault.”  Judges in these cases were not receptive to the police operation.  Provincial Court Judge V. A. Lampkin concluded that Marie Curtis Park had a reputation as “<a href="https://archive.org/stream/bodypolitic91toro#page/n17/mode/2up">a known homosexual park</a>.”  Both men were acquitted.</p>
<p>The fate of those charged in the recent arrests is still unknown, and there is concern that the police will continue or expand these undercover park operations against queers this coming summer.  The community’s <a href="http://www.dailyxtra.com/toronto/news-and-ideas/opinion/project-marie-shocking-at-least-gay-men-know-respond-210151">history of resistance </a>reveals that by collectively organizing, we can fight back. Activists and lawyers have formed a group to provide legal coordination to those charged.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/QueersCrashTheBeat/">Queers crash the beat</a> are continuing this battle from the 1970s, and they deserve our support.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks people around the world have taken to the streets in order to call politicians, business leaders, and civil servants to account. Though similar, no one event was the same. The Women&#8217;s March was carefully planned over two months between the US election and Inauguration Day; its purpose was to give voice to the open misogyny expressed by Republicans during the campaign. A week later tens of thousands flooded US airports to support travelers detained due to the idiosyncratic and illegal presidential travel ban targeting Muslims.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Two days after that, here in Canada, we mourned the killing of Azzedine Soufiane, Mamaou Tanou Barry, Khaled Belkacemi, Aboubaker Thabti, Ibrahima Barry and Abdelkrim Hassane as they left a Quebec City mosque following prayers. Again, thousands took to the streets across the country voicing concerns over the rise of hate speech and its enablers.</p>
<p>As I participated in, and continue to think about the meaning of, these movements, my attention often turns to the historiography of the crowd.<span id="more-20866"></span> In 1959, Georges Rudé published <em>The Crowd in the French Revolution</em>. A ground-breaking book at the time, he began with a historiographical intervention: historians had seldom studied the history of the crowd.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It has&#8230; long been recognized,&#8221; Rudé wrote in his introduction, &#8220;that the Revolution was not only a political, but a profound social upheaval, to the course and outcome of which masses of ordinary Frenchmen, both in the towns and countryside, contributed&#8230; But how were the crowds composed that stormed the Bastille in July 1789, marched to Versailles to fetch the king and queen to the capital in October, that overthrew the monarchy in August 1792, or silently witnessed the downfall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor? Who led them or influenced them? What were the motives that prompted them? What was the particular significance and outcome of their intervention?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>These are important questions. When shifted to the context of 2017 &#8211; and the large-scale protest movements of the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, #IdleNoMore and Black Lives Matter &#8211; I am not sure that we have clear answers. Are the events we&#8217;ve seen over the past couple of weeks one-off protests: reactions to a vulgar president, poorly thought out public policy, a mourning following a tragic event; or are they more symptomatic of broader malaise with the structures of western democracy. In just two weeks, in Canada at least, the arguments of the crowd shifted from the destabilizing threat of rapidly shifting US policies, to broad statements about the meaning of inclusion in Canadian society, towards a focus during last week&#8217;s <a href="http://canadians.org/blog/national-day-action-against-islamophobia-and-white-supremacy-february-4">National Day of Action against Islamophobia</a> on Canada&#8217;s own governmental failure to yet repeal the Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act and Bill C-51 (the Anti-Terrorism Act). What exactly have these crowds been about? What, if anything aside from timing, unites them?</p>
<p>Each of these events builds on a global culture of protest. To the list above we might also add &#8211; though ensuring not to conflate &#8211; the upsurge in right wing, nationalist populism seen in the US, UK, India, Poland and the Philippines. To differing capacities and degrees, each movement expresses profound dissatisfaction with the status quo, perceived (and often real) deep and violent histories of oppression, and a sense of distance and isolation from political and economic power. In today&#8217;s post I would like to suggest that in their size, independence of explicit political influence, and overwhelmingly peaceful nature, it is perhaps worthwhile looking back to the history of the crowd and popular protest to understand the events of the past month; asking questions about whether they are or are not indicative of broader trends.</p>

<p>In 1971, British historian E.P. Thompson put forward an argument aligning crowd action during the eighteenth century with what he called the &#8216;moral economy.&#8217; For him, periodic uprisings of the poor over the price of bread was not so much about people starving as it was the upending of perceived customs and traditions. At the end of the eighteenth century, according to Thompson, the bread riot became indicative of broader social and economic transitions; society was moving away from the paternalism of the agrarian economy towards the emerging social and political relationships associated with industrial capitalism. One of Thompson&#8217;s key interventions was to take seriously the agency of his historical subjects. As a consequence, Thompson sought to understand the ideas that people used to justify protest; their &#8220;legitimizing notions.&#8221; In the case of the eighteenth-century bread riot, he argues that &#8220;the men and women in the crowd were informed by the belief that they were defending traditional rights and customs; and, in general, that they were supported by the wider consensus in the community.&#8221; This relationship was emblematic of a moral economy that structured early-modern English society and placed the needs of the community before the profits of any one of its members.</p>
<p>I wonder whether this concept of a moral economy &#8211; modified to fit the present &#8211; encapsulates the protests that we have seen over the past three weeks and also, perhaps, the grievances espoused by those who voted Republican in this year&#8217;s US election. Facing social and economic rupture as manufacturing and fossil fuel economies shift rapidly, in the election millions of Americans looked to a candidate who reflected a world similar to their own and &#8211; importantly &#8211; distant from the culture and politics that have overseen these changes. Though policies associated with White House aide Steve Bannon will likely fail to meet their needs (at least without trampling all over the rights of others), there can be little doubt that much like the protesters during the Arab Spring, Occupy, #IdleNoMore and Black Lives Matters, the executive&#8217;s electoral base is comprised of people who increasingly feel that the mid-twentieth-century American dream is no longer possible. Much like the protesters in these larger movements, whom for many represent groups historically without an influential voice, Republican-voter core grievances seem to be the same: the political and economic system is not working for them. A moral economy &#8211; in this case premised on an enlightenment-focused concept of attainable middle-class status &#8211; has been violated.</p>
<p>To better see these parallels we might turn to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/steve-bannon-spirit-revolt-democrats-gave-up">a recent essay by Thomas Frank</a> published in last week&#8217;s <em>Guardian</em> newspaper. Though focused on Steve Bannon&#8217;s politics, Frank outlines the key areas where the American political system has rotted. Here he demonstrates the root causes of the American political crisis. Though he does not use the language of the moral economy, Frank&#8217;s conclusion suggests that discontent on both the political right and left is anchored in two fundamentally different concepts of &#8220;traditional rights and customs.&#8221; For Republicans, Frank suggests that the rights and customs underpinning the American dream were broken during the 1960s and (though he doesn&#8217;t say this explicitly) in the ways that key tenets of the civil rights movement have informed American public policy. For those on the left, grievances align more tightly around a profound sense of disconnect between the public &#8211; specifically workers &#8211; and the political class (and their financial influences) that has accompanied the implementation of neoliberal economic policies since at least the mid-to-late-1970s.</p>
<p>It is in this alignment between the grievances of the right and left, and the frequency of mass protest over the past couple of weeks, which has me wondering about the broader meaning of the crowd. This is where I think Rudé&#8217;s analysis of the French Revolution may provide guidance. Rather than the French Revolution being framed as a revolt of &#8220;unemployed country-workers&#8221; or sparked by the intellects of the Enlightenment, Rudé suggests instead that the crowds of the Revolution comprised various distinct groups with diverse interests (&#8220;craftsmen, shopkeepers and journeymen&#8221;) responding similarly to external stimuli.</p>
<p>This more nuanced and analytical approach to the crowd has been absent from much press coverage. Though in volume these events have been well covered, in their substance, questions remain. Explanations for the crowd tend to be focused on their immediate causes rather than longer-term context; its composition and local leadership rarely explored in favour of overarching commentary. There are a series of questions that remain and are worth asking in greater detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who exactly was it marching and standing vigil over the past few weeks? Do these events always involve the same people or are they different groups? How were they organized and supported?</li>
<li>To what extent did the historical conjuncture of the Women&#8217;s March, travel ban, and Quebec City shootings foster a brief culture of mass protest in Canada? Were these isolated events &#8211; caused by immediate circumstance and fueled by personal and individual motivations &#8211; or were they related ideologically, one being contingent on another?</li>
<li>To what extent have these recent protests &#8211; especially the willingness of people to take to the streets &#8211; been shaped by larger international movements like the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, #IdleNoMore and Black Lives Matter?</li>
<li>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, to what extent are the motivations of anti-Republican protesters similar to those of Republican supporters? If their grievances are related, or perhaps even similar, as some commentators have suggested (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/black-jeopardy-snl-tom-hanks-donald-trump-supporter/505142/">SNL&#8217;s Black Jeopardy guest starring Tom Hanks</a> comes to mind here), what are the implications?</li>
</ul>
<p>Historians of the crowd, I suspect, have something to say about this, both in terms of how these questions are approached and in shaping the answers given.</p>
