It has capacity of just over four billion IP addresses, almost all of which have now been allocated to Internet service providers and users.  An IPv4 address looks like this: 192.0.2.53.\r\n• IPv6 is the next generation of IP, with a 128-bit address space, providing 340 undecillion addresses. An IPv6 address looks like this: 2001:0db8::53. \r\nWhile the intention is for IPv6 to surpass IPv4 as the commonly used system, this process is ongoing.  Adoption is important because IPv4 and IPv6 essentially operate as parallel systems, meaning data cannot be exchanged between these protocols without transition technologies."},"Multistakeholder Approach":{"term":"Multistakeholder Approach","definition":"The Multistakeholder Approach is an organizational framework or structure for governance and policymaking which aims to bring together all stakeholders to collaborate and participate in the dialogue, decision-making and implementation of solutions to identified problems or goals.\r\n\r\nThe Multi-stakeholder Model at ICANN, is comprised of a diverse set of stakeholders with an interest in Internet numbering, naming and protocols from around the world who have organized into various Supporting Organizations, Constituencies and Advisory Committees, and agree to operate in an open, bottom-up, consensus-driven, and transparent manner."},"Protocol Parameter":{"term":"Protocol Parameter","definition":"Protocol parameters are internal identifiers that ensure computers can talk to and understand each other.
