<h4>
<a name="_Ref444422484"></a><a name="_Ref444420858"></a><a name="I-1"></a> Section 1.1. MISSION</h4>
<p>(a) The mission of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("<strong>ICANN</strong>") is to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet's unique identifier systems as described in this <u>Section 1.1(a)</u> (the "<strong>Mission</strong>"). Specifically, ICANN:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) Coordinates the allocation and assignment of names in the root zone of the Domain Name System ("<strong>DNS</strong>") and coordinates the development and implementation of policies concerning the registration of second-level domain names in generic top-level domains ("<strong>gTLDs</strong>"). In this role, ICANN's scope is to coordinate the development and implementation of policies:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>For which uniform or coordinated resolution is reasonably necessary to facilitate the openness, interoperability, resilience, security and/or stability of the DNS including, with respect to gTLD registrars and registries, policies in the areas described in Annex G-1 and Annex G-2; and</li>
		<li>That are developed through a bottom-up consensus-based multistakeholder process and designed to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet's unique names systems.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The issues, policies, procedures, and principles addressed in Annex G-1 and Annex G-2 with respect to gTLD registrars and registries shall be deemed to be within ICANN's Mission.</p>
	<p>(ii) Facilitates the coordination of the operation and evolution of the DNS root name server system.</p>
	<p><a name="_Ref444420864"></a>(iii) Coordinates the allocation and assignment at the top-most level of Internet Protocol numbers and Autonomous System numbers. In service of its Mission, ICANN (A) provides registration services and open access for global number registries as requested by the Internet Engineering Task Force ("<strong>IETF</strong>") and the Regional Internet Registries ("<strong>RIRs</strong>") and (B) facilitates the development of global number registry policies by the affected community and other related tasks as agreed with the RIRs.</p>
	<p>(iv) Collaborates with other bodies as appropriate to provide registries needed for the functioning of the Internet as specified by Internet protocol standards development organizations. In service of its Mission, ICANN's scope is to provide registration services and open access for registries in the public domain requested by Internet protocol development organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(b) ICANN shall not act outside its Mission.</p>
<p>(c) ICANN shall not regulate (i.e., impose rules and restrictions on) services that use the Internet's unique identifiers or the content that such services carry or provide, outside the express scope of <u>Section 1.1(a)</u>. For the avoidance of doubt, ICANN does not hold any governmentally authorized regulatory authority.</p>
<p>(d) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) the foregoing prohibitions are not intended to limit ICANN's authority or ability to adopt or implement policies or procedures that take into account the use of domain names as natural-language identifiers;</p>
	<p>(ii) Notwithstanding any provision of the Bylaws to the contrary, the terms and conditions of the documents listed in subsections (A) through (C) below, and ICANN's performance of its obligations or duties thereunder, may not be challenged by any party in any proceeding against, or process involving, ICANN (including a request for reconsideration or an independent review process pursuant to Article 4) on the basis that such terms and conditions conflict with, or are in violation of, ICANN's Mission or otherwise exceed the scope of ICANN's authority or powers pursuant to these Bylaws ("<strong>Bylaws</strong>") or ICANN's Articles of Incorporation ("<strong>Articles of Incorporation</strong>"):</p>
	<p>(A)</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>(1) all registry agreements and registrar accreditation agreements between ICANN and registry operators or registrars in force on 1 October 2016 <sup><a id="note1" name="note1" href="#foot1"></a>[1]</sup>, including, in each case, any terms or conditions therein that are not contained in the underlying form of registry agreement and registrar accreditation agreement;</p>
		<p>(2) any registry agreement or registrar accreditation agreement not encompassed by (1) above to the extent its terms do not vary materially from the form of registry agreement or registrar accreditation agreement that existed on 1 October 2016;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>(B)any renewals of agreements described in subsection (A) pursuant to their terms and conditions for renewal; and</p>
	<p>(C)ICANN's Five-Year Strategic Plan and Five-Year Operating Plan existing on 10 March 2016.</p>
	<p>(iii) <u>Section 1.1(d)(ii)</u> does not limit the ability of a party to any agreement described therein to challenge any provision of such agreement on any other basis, including the other party's interpretation of the provision, in any proceeding or process involving ICANN.</p>
	<p>(iv) ICANN shall have the ability to negotiate, enter into and enforce agreements, including public interest commitments, with any party in service of its Mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
<a name="_Ref444422487"></a><a name="_Ref444420873"></a><a name="I-2"></a> Section 1.2. COMMITMENTS AND CORE VALUES</h4>
<p>In performing its Mission, ICANN will act in a manner that complies with and reflects ICANN's Commitments and respects ICANN's Core Values, each as described below.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444420874"></a>(a) <strong>COMMITMENTS</strong></p>
<p><a name="I-2.1"></a>In performing its Mission, ICANN must operate in a manner consistent with these Bylaws for the benefit of the Internet community as a whole, carrying out its activities in conformity with relevant principles of international law and international conventions and applicable local law, through open and transparent processes that enable competition and open entry in Internet-related markets. Specifically, ICANN commits to do the following (each, a "<strong>Commitment</strong>," and collectively, the "<strong>Commitments</strong>"):</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><a name="I-2.2"></a>(i) Preserve and enhance the administration of <a name="_Ref444423099"></a>the DNS and the operational stability, reliability, security, global interoperability, resilience, and openness of the DNS and the Internet;</p>
	<p>(ii) Maintain the capacity and ability to coordinate the DNS at the overall level and work for the maintenance of a single, interoperable Internet;</p>
	<p>(iii) Respect the creativity, innovation, and flow of information made possible by the Internet by limiting ICANN's activities to matters that are within ICANN's Mission and require or significantly benefit from global coordination;</p>
	<p>(iv) Employ open, transparent and bottom-up, multistakeholder policy development processes that are led by the private sector (including business stakeholders, civil society, the technical community, academia, and end users), while duly taking into account the public policy advice of governments and public authorities. These processes shall (A) seek input from the public, for whose benefit ICANN in all events shall act, (B) promote well-informed decisions<a name="_Ref444423103"></a> based on expert advice, and (C) ensure that those entities most affected can assist in the policy development process;</p>
	<p>(v) Make decisions by applying documented policies consistently, neutrally, objectively, and fairly, without singling out any particular party for discriminatory treatment (i.e., making an unjustified prejudicial distinction between or among different parties); and</p>
	<p>(vi) Remain accountable to the Internet community through mechanisms defined in these Bylaws that enhance ICANN's effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="_Ref444420881"></a><a name="I-2.6"></a> <a name="I-2.10"></a>(b) <strong>CORE VALUES</strong></p>
<p>In performing its Mission, the following "<strong>Core Values</strong>" should also guide the decisions and actions of ICANN:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) To the extent feasible and appropriate<a name="_Ref444423106"></a>, delegating coordination functions to or recognizing the policy role of, other responsible entities that reflect the interests of affected parties and the roles of bodies internal to ICANN and relevant external expert bodies;</p>

	<p>(iv) Introducing and promoting competition in the registration of domain names where practicable and beneficial to the public interest as identified through the bottom-up, multistakeholder policy development process;</p>
	<p>(v) Operating with efficiency and excellence, in a fiscally responsible and accountable manner and, where practicable and not inconsistent with ICANN's other obligations under these Bylaws, at a speed that is responsive to the needs of the global Internet community;</p>
	<p><a name="_Ref444420887"></a>(vi) While remaining rooted in the private sector (including business stakeholders, civil society, the technical community, academia, and end users), recognizing that governments and public authorities are responsible for public policy and duly taking into account the public policy advice of governments and public authorities;</p>

	<p>(viii) Subject to the limitations set forth in <u>Section 27.2</u>, within the scope of its Mission and other Core Values, respecting internationally recognized human rights as required by applicable law. This Core Value does not create, and shall not be interpreted to create, any obligation on ICANN outside its Mission, or beyond obligations found in applicable law. This Core Value does not obligate ICANN to enforce its human rights obligations, or the human rights obligations of other parties, against other parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(c) The Commitments and Core Values are intended to apply in the broadest possible range of circumstances. The Commitments reflect ICANN's fundamental compact with the global Internet community and are intended to apply consistently and comprehensively to ICANN's activities. The specific way in which Core Values are applied, individually and collectively, to any given situation may depend on many factors that cannot be fully anticipated or enumerated. Situations may arise in which perfect fidelity to all Core Values simultaneously is not possible. Accordingly, in any situation where one Core Value must be balanced with another, potentially competing Core Value, the result of the balancing must serve a policy developed through the bottom-up multistakeholder process or otherwise best serve ICANN's Mission.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref444420905"></a><a name="III-6.1"></a>(a) With respect to any policies that are being considered by the Board for adoption that substantially affect the operation of the Internet or third parties, including the imposition of any fees or charges, ICANN shall:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><a name="_Ref444420906"></a><a name="III-6.1a"></a>(i) provide public notice on the Website explaining what policies are being considered for adoption and why, at least twenty-one days (and if practical, earlier) prior to any action by the Board;</p>
	<p><a name="_Ref444420907"></a><a name="III-6.1b"></a>(ii) provide a reasonable opportunity for parties to comment on the adoption of the proposed policies, to see the comments of others, and to reply to those comments (such comment period to be aligned with ICANN's public comment practices), prior to any action by the Board; and</p>
	<p><a name="_Ref444420908"></a><a name="III-6.1c"></a>(iii) in those cases where the policy action affects public policy concerns, to request the opinion of the Governmental Advisory Committee ("<strong>GAC</strong>" or "<strong>Governmental Advisory Committee</strong>") and take duly into account any advice timely presented by the Governmental Advisory Committee on its own initiative or at the Board's request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="_Ref444420909"></a><a name="III-6.2"></a>(b) Where both practically feasible and consistent with the relevant policy development process, an in-person public forum shall also be held for discussion of any proposed policies as described in <u>Section 3.6(a)(ii)</u>, prior to any final Board action.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444420910"></a><a name="III-6.3"></a>(c) After taking action on any policy subject to this <u> Section 3.6</u>, the Board shall publish in the meeting minutes the rationale for any resolution adopted by the Board (including the possible material effects, if any, of its decision on the global public interest, including a discussion of the material impacts to the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS, financial impacts or other issues that were considered by the Board in approving such resolutions), the vote of each Director voting on the resolution, and the separate statement of any Director desiring publication of such a statement.</p>
<p>(d) Where a Board resolution is consistent with GAC Consensus Advice (as defined in <u>Section 12.2(a)(x)</u>), the Board shall make a determination whether the GAC Consensus Advice was a material factor in the Board's adoption of such resolution, in which case the Board shall so indicate in such resolution approving the decision (a "<strong>GAC Consensus Board Resolution</strong>") and shall cite the applicable GAC Consensus Advice. To the extent practical, the Board shall ensure that GAC Consensus Board Resolutions only relate to the matters that were the subject of the applicable GAC Consensus Advice and not matters unrelated to the applicable GAC Consensus Advice. For the avoidance of doubt: (i) a GAC Consensus Board Resolution shall not have the effect of making any other Board resolutions in the same set or series so designated, unless other resolutions are specifically identified as such by the Board; and (ii) a Board resolution approving an action consistent with GAC Consensus Advice received during a standard engagement process in which input from all Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees has been requested shall not be considered a GAC Consensus Board Resolution based solely on that input, unless the GAC Consensus Advice was a material factor in the Board's adoption of such resolution.</p>
<p>(e) GAC Carve-out</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) Where a Board resolution is consistent with GAC Consensus Advice and the Board has determined that the GAC Consensus Advice was a material factor in the Board's adoption of such resolution as described in the relevant GAC Consensus Board Resolution, the Governmental Advisory Committee shall not participate as a decision-maker in the EC's exercise of its right to challenge the Board's implementation of such GAC Consensus Advice. In such cases, the Governmental Advisory Committee may participate in the EC in an advisory capacity only with respect to the applicable processes described in Annex D, but its views will not count as support or an objection for purposes of the thresholds needed to convene a community forum or exercise any right of the EC ("<strong>GAC Carve-out</strong>"). In the case of a Board Recall Process (as defined in <u>Section 3.3</u> of Annex D), the GAC Carve-out shall only apply if an IRP Panel has found that, in implementing GAC Consensus Advice, the Board acted inconsistently with the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws.</p>
	<p>(ii) When the GAC Carve-out applies (A) any petition notice provided in accordance with Annex D or Approval Action Board Notice (as defined in <u>Section 1.2</u> of Annex D) shall include a statement that cites the specific GAC Consensus Board Resolution and the line item or provision that implements such specific GAC Consensus Board Resolution ("<strong>GAC Consensus Statement</strong>"), (B) the Governmental Advisory Committee shall not be eligible to support or object to any petition pursuant to Annex D or Approval Action (as defined in <u>Section 1.1</u> of Annex D), and (C) any EC Decision (as defined in <u>Section 4.1(a)</u> of Annex D) that requires the support of four or more Decisional Participants (as defined in <u>Section 6.1(a)</u>) pursuant to Annex D shall instead require the support of three or more Decisional Participants with no more than one Decisional Participant objecting.</p>
	<p>(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the GAC Carve-out shall not apply to the exercise of the EC's rights where a material factor in the Board's decision was advice of the Governmental Advisory Committee that was not GAC Consensus Advice.</p>

<h4>
<a name="_Ref444422501"></a><a name="_Ref444420913"></a><a name="IV-1"></a> Section 4.1. PURPOSE</h4>
<p>In carrying out its Mission, ICANN shall be accountable to the community for operating in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and these Bylaws, including the Mission set forth in <u>Article 1</u> of these Bylaws.

<p><a name="_Ref444420915"></a><a name="IV-2.1"></a>(a) ICANN shall have in place a process by which any person or entity materially affected by an action or inaction of the ICANN Board or Staff may request ("<strong>Requestor</strong>") the review or reconsideration of that action or inaction by the Board. For purposes of these Bylaws, "<strong>Staff</strong>" includes employees and individual long-term paid contractors serving in locations where ICANN does not have the mechanisms to employ such contractors directly.</p>
<p>(b) The EC may file a Reconsideration Request (as defined in <u>Section 4.2(c)</u>) if approved pursuant to <u>Section 4.3</u> of Annex D ("<strong>Community Reconsideration Request</strong>") and if the matter relates to the exercise of the powers and rights of the EC of these Bylaws.

</blockquote>
<p>(f) ICANN shall absorb the normal administrative costs of the Reconsideration Request process. Except with respect to a Community Reconsideration Request, ICANN reserves the right to recover from a party requesting review or reconsideration any costs that are deemed to be extraordinary in nature. When such extraordinary costs can be foreseen, that fact and the reasons why such costs are necessary and appropriate to evaluating the Reconsideration Request shall be communicated to the Requestor, who shall then have the option of withdrawing the request or agreeing to bear such costs.</p>

<p>(i) Requestors shall not provide more than <a name="DocXTextRef2514"></a> 25 pages (double-spaced, 12-point font) of argument in support of a Reconsideration Request, not including exhibits. Requestors may submit all documentary evidence necessary to demonstrate why the action or inaction should be reconsidered, without limitation.</p>
<p>(j) Reconsideration Requests from different Requestors may be considered in the same proceeding so long as: (i) the requests involve the same general action or inaction; and (ii) the Requestors are similarly affected by such action or inaction. In addition, consolidated filings may be appropriate if the alleged causal connection and the resulting harm is substantially the same for all of the Requestors. Every Requestor must be able to demonstrate that it has been materially harmed and adversely impacted by the action or inaction giving rise to the request.</p>
<p><a name="article4.4.2.k" id="article4.4.2.k"></a>(k) The Board Governance Committee shall review each Reconsideration Request upon its receipt to determine if it is sufficiently stated. The Board Governance Committee may summarily dismiss a Reconsideration Request if: (i) the Requestor fails to meet the requirements for bringing a Reconsideration Request; or (ii) it is frivolous. The Board Governance Committee's summary dismissal of a Reconsideration Request shall be documented and promptly posted on the Website.</p>
<p><a name="article4.4.2.l" id="article4.4.2.l"></a>(l) For all Reconsideration Requests that are not summarily dismissed, except Reconsideration Requests described in <u>Section 4.2(l)(iii)</u> and Community Reconsideration Requests, the Reconsideration Request shall be sent to the Ombudsman, who shall promptly proceed to review and consider the Reconsideration Request.</p>

In any event, the Board Governance Committee shall endeavor to produce its final recommendation to the Board within 90 days of receipt of the Reconsideration Request. The final recommendation of the Board Governance Committee shall be documented and promptly (i.e., as soon as practicable) posted on the Website and shall address each of the arguments raised in the Reconsideration Request. The Requestor may file a 10-page (double-spaced, 12-point font) document, not including exhibits, in rebuttal to the Board Governance Committee's recommendation within 15 days of receipt of the recommendation, which shall also be promptly (i.e., as soon as practicable) posted to the Website and provided to the Board for its evaluation; provided, that such rebuttal shall: (i) be limited to rebutting or contradicting the issues raised in the Board Governance Committee's final recommendation; and (ii) not offer new evidence to support an argument made in the Requestor's original Reconsideration Request that the Requestor could have provided when the Requestor initially submitted the Reconsideration Request.</p>
<p><a name="article4.4.2.r" id="article4.4.2.r"></a>(r) The Board shall not be bound to follow the recommendations of the Board Governance Committee. The final decision of the Board and its rationale shall be made public as part of the preliminary report and minutes of the Board meeting at which action is taken. The Board shall issue its decision on the recommendation of the Board Governance Committee within 45 days of receipt of the Board Governance Committee's recommendation or as soon thereafter as feasible. Any circumstances that delay the Board from acting within this timeframe must be identified and posted on the Website. In any event, the Board's final decision shall be made within 135 days of initial receipt of the Reconsideration Request by the Board Governance Committee. The Board's decision on the recommendation shall be posted on the Website in accordance with the Board's posting obligations as set forth in <u>Article 3</u> of these Bylaws. If the Requestor so requests, the Board shall post both a recording and a transcript of the substantive Board discussion from the meeting at which the Board considered the Board Governance Committee's recommendation. All briefing materials supplied to the Board shall be provided to the Requestor. The Board may redact such briefing materials and the recording and transcript on the basis that such information (i) relates to confidential personnel matters, (ii) is covered by attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other recognized legal privilege, (iii) is subject to a legal obligation that ICANN maintain its confidentiality, (iv) would disclose trade secrets, or (v) would present a material risk of negative impact to the security, stability or resiliency of the Internet. In the case of any redaction, ICANN will provide the Requestor a written rationale for such redaction. If a Requestor believes that a redaction was improper, the Requestor may use an appropriate accountability mechanism to challenge the scope of ICANN's redaction.</p>
<p><a name="article4.4.2.s" id="article4.4.2.s"></a>(s) If the Requestor believes that the Board action or inaction for which a Reconsideration Request is submitted is so urgent that the timing requirements of the process set forth in this <u> Section 4.2</u> are too long, the Requestor may apply to the Board Governance Committee for urgent consideration. Any request for urgent consideration must be made within two business days (as calculated by local time at the location of ICANN's principal office) of the posting of the resolution at issue. A request for urgent consideration must include a discussion of why the matter is urgent for reconsideration and must demonstrate a likelihood of success with the Reconsideration Request.</p>
<p><a name="article4.4.2.t" id="article4.4.2.t"></a>(t) The Board Governance Committee shall respond to the request for urgent consideration within two business days after receipt of such request. If the Board Governance Committee agrees to consider the matter with urgency, it will cause notice to be provided to the Requestor, who will have two business days after notification to complete the Reconsideration Request. The Board Governance Committee shall issue a recommendation on the urgent Reconsideration Request within seven days of the completion of the filing of the Reconsideration Request, or as soon thereafter as feasible. If the Board Governance Committee does not agree to consider the matter with urgency, the Requestor may still file a Reconsideration Request within the regular time frame set forth within these Bylaws.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444420946"></a>(u) The Board Governance Committee shall submit a report to the Board on an annual basis containing at least the following information for the preceding calendar year:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) the number and general nature of Reconsideration Requests received, including an identification if the Reconsideration Requests were acted upon, summarily dismissed, or remain pending;</p>
	<p>(ii) for any Reconsideration Requests that remained pending at the end of the calendar year, the average length of time for which such Reconsideration Requests have been pending, and a description of the reasons for any Reconsideration Request pending for more than ninety (90) days;</p>
	<p><a name="_Ref444420949"></a>(iii) an explanation of any other mechanisms available to ensure that ICANN is accountable to persons materially affected by its decisions; and</p>
	<p>(iv) whether or not, in the Board Governance Committee's view, the criteria for which reconsideration may be requested should be revised, or another process should be adopted or modified, to ensure that all persons materially affected by ICANN decisions have meaningful access to a review process that ensures fairness while limiting frivolous claims.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref444420952"></a><a name="_Ref445931320"></a><a name="IV-3.1"></a>(a) In addition to the reconsideration process described in <u>Section 4.2</u>, ICANN shall have a separate process for independent third-party review of Disputes (defined in <u>Section 4.3(b)(iii)</u>) alleged by a Claimant (as defined in <u>Section 4.3(b)(i)</u>) to be within the scope of the Independent Review Process ("<strong>IRP</strong>"). The IRP is intended to hear and resolve Disputes for the following purposes ("<strong>Purposes of the IRP</strong>"):</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) Ensure that ICANN does not exceed the scope of its Mission and otherwise complies with its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.</p>
	<p>(ii) Empower the global Internet community and Claimants to enforce compliance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws through meaningful, affordable and accessible expert review of Covered Actions (as defined in <u>Section 4.3(b)(i)</u>).</p>
	<p>(iii) Ensure that ICANN is accountable to the global Internet community and Claimants.</p>
	<p>(iv) Address claims that ICANN has failed to enforce its rights under the IANA Naming Function Contract (as defined in <u>Section 16.3(a)</u>).</p>
	<p>(v) Provide a mechanism by which direct customers of the IANA naming functions may seek resolution of PTI (as defined in <u>Section 16.1</u>) service complaints that are not resolved through mediation.</p>
	<p>(vi) Reduce Disputes by creating precedent to guide and inform the Board, Officers (as defined in <u>Section 15.1</u>), Staff members, Supporting Organizations, Advisory Committees, and the global Internet community in connection with policy development and implementation.</p>
	<p>(vii) Secure the accessible, transparent, efficient, consistent, coherent, and just resolution of Disputes.</p>
	<p>(viii) Lead to binding, final resolutions consistent with international arbitration norms that are enforceable in any court with proper jurisdiction.</p>
	<p>(ix) Provide a mechanism for the resolution of Disputes, as an alternative to legal action in the civil courts of the United States or other jurisdictions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <u>Section 4.3</u> shall be construed, implemented, and administered in a manner consistent with these Purposes of the IRP.</p>
<p>(b) The scope of the IRP is defined with reference to the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) A "<strong>Claimant</strong>" is any legal or natural person, group, or entity including, but not limited to the EC, a Supporting Organization, or an Advisory Committee that has been materially affected by a Dispute. To be materially affected by a Dispute, the Claimant must suffer an injury or harm that is directly and causally connected to the alleged violation.</p>
	<p>(A)The EC is deemed to be materially affected by all Covered Actions. ICANN shall not assert any defenses of standing or capacity against the EC in any forum.</p>
	<p>(B)ICANN shall not object to the standing of the EC, a Supporting Organization, or an Advisory Committee to participate in an IRP, to compel an IRP, or to enforce an IRP decision on the basis that it is not a legal person with capacity to sue. No special pleading of a Claimant's capacity or of the legal existence of a person that is a Claimant shall be required in the IRP proceedings. No Claimant shall be allowed to proceed if the IRP Panel (as defined in <u>Section 4.3(g)</u>) concludes based on evidence submitted to it that the Claimant does not fairly or adequately represent the interests of those on whose behalf the Claimant purports to act.</p>
	<p>(ii) "<strong>Covered Actions</strong>" are defined as any actions or failures to act by or within ICANN committed by the Board, individual Directors, Officers, or Staff members that give rise to a Dispute.</p>
	<p>(iii) "<strong>Disputes</strong>" are defined as:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A)Claims that Covered Actions constituted an action or inaction that violated the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, including but not limited to any action or inaction that:</p>
<p>(1) exceeded the scope of the Mission;</p>
<p>(2) resulted from action taken in response to advice or input from any Advisory Committee or Supporting Organization that are claimed to be inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws;</p>
<p>(3) resulted from decisions of process-specific expert panels that are claimed to be inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws;</p>
<p>(4) resulted from a response to a DIDP (as defined in <u>Section 22.7(d)</u>) request that is claimed to be inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; or</p>
<p>(5) arose from claims involving rights of the EC as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.</p>
<p>(B)Claims that ICANN, the Board, individual Directors, Officers or Staff members have not enforced ICANN's contractual rights with respect to the IANA Naming Function Contract, and</p>
<p>(C)Claims regarding PTI service complaints by direct customers of the IANA naming functions that are not resolved through mediation.</p>
<p>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 4.3, the IRP's scope shall exclude all of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) EC challenges to the result(s) of a PDP, unless the Supporting Organization(s) that approved the PDP supports the EC bringing such a challenge;</p>
	<p>(ii) Claims relating to ccTLD delegations and re-delegations;</p>
	<p>(iii) Claims relating to Internet numbering resources, and</p>
	<p>(iv) Claims relating to protocol parameters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(d) An IRP shall commence with the Claimant's filing of a written statement of a Dispute (a "<strong>Claim</strong>") with the IRP Provider (described in <u>Section 4.3(m)</u> below). For the EC to commence an IRP ("<strong>Community IRP</strong>"), the EC shall first comply with the procedures set forth in <u>Section 4.2</u> of Annex D.</p>
<p>(e) Cooperative Engagement Process</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) Except for Claims brought by the EC in accordance with this <u>Section 4.3</u> and <u>Section 4.</u>2 of Annex D, prior to the filing of a Claim, the parties are strongly encouraged to participate in a non-binding Cooperative Engagement Process ("<strong>CEP</strong>") for the purpose of attempting to resolve and/or narrow the Dispute. CEPs shall be conducted pursuant to the CEP Rules to be developed with community involvement, adopted by the Board, and as amended from time to time.</p>
	<p>(ii) The CEP is voluntary. However, except for Claims brought by the EC in accordance with this <u>Section 4.3</u> and <u>Section 4.2</u> of Annex D, if the Claimant does not participate in good faith in the CEP and ICANN is the prevailing party in the IRP, the IRP Panel shall award to ICANN all reasonable fees and costs incurred by ICANN in the IRP, including legal fees.</p>
	<p>(iii) Either party may terminate the CEP efforts if that party: (A) concludes in good faith that further efforts are unlikely to produce agreement; or (B) requests the inclusion of an independent dispute resolution facilitator ("<strong>IRP Mediator</strong>") after at least one CEP meeting.</p>
	<p>(iv) Unless all parties agree on the selection of a particular IRP Mediator, any IRP Mediator appointed shall be selected from the members of the Standing Panel (described in <u>Section 4.3(j)</u> below) by its Chair, but such IRP Mediator shall not thereafter be eligible to serve as a panelist presiding over an IRP on the matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(f) ICANN hereby waives any defenses that may be afforded under Section 5141 of the California Corporations Code ("<strong>CCC</strong>") against any Claimant, and shall not object to the standing of any such Claimant to participate in or to compel an IRP, or to enforce an IRP decision on the basis that such Claimant may not otherwise be able to assert that a Covered Action is ultra vires.</p>
<p>(g) Upon the filing of a Claim, an Independent Review Process Panel ("<strong>IRP Panel</strong>", described in <u>Section 4.3(k)</u> below) shall be selected in accordance with the Rules of Procedure (as defined in <u>Section 4.3(n)(i)</u>). Following the selection of an IRP Panel, that IRP Panel shall be charged with hearing and resolving the Dispute, considering the Claim and ICANN's written response ("<strong>Response</strong>") in compliance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as understood in light of prior IRP Panel decisions decided under the same (or an equivalent prior) version of the provision of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws at issue, and norms of applicable law. If no Response is timely filed by ICANN, the IRP Panel may accept the Claim as unopposed and proceed to evaluate and decide the Claim pursuant to the procedures set forth in these Bylaws.</p>
<p>(h) After a Claim is referred to an IRP Panel, the parties are urged to participate in conciliation discussions for the purpose of attempting to narrow the issues that are to be addressed by the IRP Panel.</p>
<p>(i) Each IRP Panel shall conduct an objective, de novo examination of the Dispute.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) With respect to Covered Actions, the IRP Panel shall make findings of fact to determine whether the Covered Action constituted an action or inaction that violated the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.</p>
	<p>(ii) All Disputes shall be decided in compliance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as understood in the context of the norms of applicable law and prior relevant IRP decisions.</p>
	<p>(iii) For Claims arising out of the Board's exercise of its fiduciary duties, the IRP Panel shall not replace the Board's reasonable judgment with its own so long as the Board's action or inaction is within the realm of reasonable business judgment.</p>
	<p>(iv) With respect to claims that ICANN has not enforced its contractual rights with respect to the IANA Naming Function Contract, the standard of review shall be whether there was a material breach of ICANN's obligations under the IANA Naming Function Contract, where the alleged breach has resulted in material harm to the Claimant.</p>
	<p>(v) For avoidance of doubt, IRPs initiated through the mechanism contemplated at <u>Section 4.3(a)(iv)</u> above, shall be subject to a separate standard of review as defined in the IANA Naming Function Contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(j) Standing Panel</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) There shall be an omnibus standing panel of at least seven members (the "<strong>Standing Panel</strong>") each of whom shall possess significant relevant legal expertise in one or more of the following areas: international law, corporate governance, judicial systems, alternative dispute resolution and/or arbitration. Each member of the Standing Panel shall also have knowledge, developed over time, regarding the DNS and ICANN's Mission, work, policies, practices, and procedures. Members of the Standing Panel shall receive at a minimum, training provided by ICANN on the workings and management of the Internet's unique identifiers and other appropriate training as recommended by the IRP Implementation Oversight Team (described in <u>Section 4.3(n)(i)</u>).</p>
	<p>(ii) ICANN shall, in consultation with the Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees, initiate a four-step process to establish the Standing Panel to ensure the availability of a number of IRP panelists that is sufficient to allow for the timely resolution of Disputes consistent with the Purposes of the IRP. </p>
	<p>(A)ICANN, in consultation with the Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees, shall initiate a tender process for an organization to provide administrative support for the IRP Provider (as defined in <u>Section 4.3(m)</u>), beginning by consulting the "<strong>IRP Implementation Oversight Team</strong>" (described in <u>Section 4.3(n)(i)</u>) on a draft tender document.</p>
	<p>(B)ICANN shall issue a call for expressions of interest from potential panelists, and work with the Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees and the Board to identify and solicit applications from well-qualified candidates, and to conduct an initial review and vetting of applications. </p>
	<p>(C)The Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees shall nominate a slate of proposed panel members from the well-qualified candidates identified per the process set forth in <u>Section 4.3(j)(ii)(B)</u>.</p>
	<p>(D)Final selection shall be subject to Board confirmation, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
	<p>(iii) Appointments to the Standing Panel shall be made for a fixed term of five years with no removal except for specified cause in the nature of corruption, misuse of position, fraud or criminal activity. The recall process shall be developed by the IRP Implementation Oversight Team.</p>
	<p>(iv) Reasonable efforts shall be taken to achieve cultural, linguistic, gender, and legal tradition diversity, and diversity by Geographic Region (as defined in <u>Section 7.5</u>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(k) IRP Panel</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) A three-member IRP Panel shall be selected from the Standing Panel to hear a specific Dispute.</p>
	<p>(ii) The Claimant and ICANN shall each select one panelist from the Standing Panel, and the two panelists selected by the parties will select the third panelist from the Standing Panel. In the event that a Standing Panel is not in place when an IRP Panel must be convened for a given proceeding or is in place but does not have capacity due to other IRP commitments or the requisite diversity of skill and experience needed for a particular IRP proceeding, the Claimant and ICANN shall each select a qualified panelist from outside the Standing Panel and the two panelists selected by the parties shall select the third panelist. In the event that no Standing Panel is in place when an IRP Panel must be convened and the two party-selected panelists cannot agree on the third panelist, the IRP Provider's rules shall apply to selection of the third panelist.</p>
	<p>(iii) Assignment from the Standing Panel to IRP Panels shall take into consideration the Standing Panel members' individual experience and expertise in issues related to highly technical, civil society, business, diplomatic, and regulatory skills as needed by each specific proceeding, and such requests from the parties for any particular expertise.</p>
	<p>(iv) Upon request of an IRP Panel, the IRP Panel shall have access to independent skilled technical experts at the expense of ICANN, although all substantive interactions between the IRP Panel and such experts shall be conducted on the record, except when public disclosure could materially and unduly harm participants, such as by exposing trade secrets or violating rights of personal privacy.</p>
	<p>(v) IRP Panel decisions shall be made by a simple majority of the IRP Panel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(l) All IRP proceedings shall be administered in English as the primary working language, with provision of translation services for Claimants if needed.</p>
<p>(m) IRP Provider </p>
<p>(i) All IRP proceedings shall be administered by a well-respected international dispute resolution provider ("<strong>IRP Provider</strong>"). The IRP Provider shall receive and distribute IRP Claims, Responses, and all other submissions arising from an IRP at the direction of the IRP Panel, and shall function independently from ICANN.</p>
<p>(n) Rules of Procedure</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) An IRP Implementation Oversight Team shall be established in consultation with the Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees and comprised of members of the global Internet community. The IRP Implementation Oversight Team, and once the Standing Panel is established the IRP Implementation Oversight Team in consultation with the Standing Panel, shall develop clear published rules for the IRP ("<strong>Rules of Procedure</strong>") that conform with international arbitration norms and are streamlined, easy to understand and apply fairly to all parties. Upon request, the IRP Implementation Oversight Team shall have assistance of counsel and other appropriate experts. </p>
	<p>(ii) The Rules of Procedure shall be informed by international arbitration norms and consistent with the Purposes of the IRP. Specialized Rules of Procedure may be designed for reviews of PTI service complaints that are asserted by direct customers of the IANA naming functions and are not resolved through mediation. The Rules of Procedure shall be published and subject to a period of public comment that complies with the designated practice for public comment periods within ICANN, and take effect upon approval by the Board, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.</p>
	<p>(iii) The Standing Panel may recommend amendments to such Rules of Procedure as it deems appropriate to fulfill the Purposes of the IRP, however no such amendment shall be effective without approval by the Board after publication and a period of public comment that complies with the designated practice for public comment periods within ICANN. </p>
	<p>(iv) The Rules of Procedure are intended to ensure fundamental fairness and due process and shall at a minimum address the following elements:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A) The time within which a Claim must be filed after a Claimant becomes aware or reasonably should have become aware of the action or inaction giving rise to the Dispute;</p>
<p>(B)Issues relating to joinder, intervention, and consolidation of Claims;</p>
<p>(C)Rules governing written submissions, including the required elements of a Claim, other requirements or limits on content, time for filing, length of statements, number of supplemental statements, if any, permitted evidentiary support (factual and expert), including its length, both in support of a Claimant's Claim and in support of ICANN's Response;</p>
<p>(D)Availability and limitations on discovery methods;</p>
<p>(E)Whether hearings shall be permitted, and if so what form and structure such hearings would take;</p>
<p>(F)Procedures if ICANN elects not to respond to an IRP; and</p>
<p>(G)The standards and rules governing appeals from IRP Panel decisions, including which IRP Panel decisions may be appealed.</p>
<p>(o) Subject to the requirements of this <u>Section 4.3</u>, each IRP Panel shall have the authority to:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) Summarily dismiss Disputes that are brought without standing, lack substance, or are frivolous or vexatious;</p>
	<p>(ii) Request additional written submissions from the Claimant or from other parties;</p>
	<p>(iii) Declare whether a Covered Action constituted an action or inaction that violated the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, declare whether ICANN failed to enforce ICANN's contractual rights with respect to the IANA Naming Function Contract or resolve PTI service complaints by direct customers of the IANA naming functions, as applicable;</p>
	<p>(iv) Recommend that ICANN stay any action or decision, or take necessary interim action, until such time as the opinion of the IRP Panel is considered;</p>
	<p>(v) Consolidate Disputes if the facts and circumstances are sufficiently similar, and take such other actions as are necessary for the efficient resolution of Disputes;</p>
	<p>(vi)  Determine the timing for each IRP proceeding; and</p>
	<p>(vii) Determine the shifting of IRP costs and expenses consistent with <u>Section 4.3(r)</u>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(p) A Claimant may request interim relief. Interim relief may include prospective relief, interlocutory relief, or declaratory or injunctive relief, and specifically may include a stay of the challenged ICANN action or decision until such time as the opinion of the IRP Panel is considered as described in <u>Section 4.3(o)(iv)</u>, in order to maintain the <em>status quo</em>. A single member of the Standing Panel ("<strong>Emergency Panelist</strong>") shall be selected to adjudicate requests for interim relief. In the event that no Standing Panel is in place when an Emergency Panelist must be selected, the IRP Provider's rules shall apply to the selection of the Emergency Panelist. Interim relief may only be provided if the Emergency Panelist determines that the Claimant has established all of the following factors:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) A harm for which there will be no adequate remedy in the absence of such relief;</p>
	<p>(ii) Either: (A) likelihood of success on the merits; or (B) sufficiently serious questions related to the merits; and</p>
	<p>(iii) A balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party seeking relief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(q) Conflicts of Interest </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) Standing Panel members must be independent of ICANN and its Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees, and so must adhere to the following criteria:</p>
	<p>(A)Upon consideration for the Standing Panel and on an ongoing basis, Panelists shall have an affirmative obligation to disclose any material relationship with ICANN, a Supporting Organization, an Advisory Committee, or any other participant in an IRP proceeding.</p>
	<p>(B)Additional independence requirements to be developed by the IRP Implementation Oversight Team, including term limits and restrictions on post-term appointment to other ICANN positions.</p>
	<p>(ii) The IRP Provider shall disclose any material relationship with ICANN, a Supporting Organization, an Advisory Committee, or any other participant in an IRP proceeding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(r) ICANN shall bear all the administrative costs of maintaining the IRP mechanism, including compensation of Standing Panel members. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.3(e)(ii), each party to an IRP proceeding shall bear its own legal expenses, except that ICANN shall bear all costs associated with a Community IRP, including the costs of all legal counsel and technical experts. Nevertheless, except with respect to a Community IRP, the IRP Panel may shift and provide for the losing party to pay administrative costs and/or fees of the prevailing party in the event it identifies the losing party's Claim or defense as frivolous or abusive.</p>
<p>(s) An IRP Panel should complete an IRP proceeding expeditiously, issuing an early scheduling order and its written decision no later than six months after the filing of the Claim, except as otherwise permitted under the Rules of Procedure. The preceding sentence does not provide the basis for a Covered Action.</p>
<p>(t) Each IRP Panel shall make its decision based solely on the documentation, supporting materials, and arguments submitted by the parties, and in its decision shall specifically designate the prevailing party as to each part of a Claim.</p>
<p>(u) All IRP Panel proceedings shall be conducted on the record, and documents filed in connection with IRP Panel proceedings shall be posted on the Website, except for settlement negotiation or other proceedings that could materially and unduly harm participants if conducted publicly. The Rules of Procedure, and all Claims, petitions, and decisions shall promptly be posted on the Website when they become available. Each IRP Panel may, in its discretion, grant a party's request to keep certain information confidential, such as trade secrets, but only if such confidentiality does not materially interfere with the transparency of the IRP proceeding.</p>
<p>(v) Subject to this <u>Section 4.3</u>, all IRP decisions shall be written and made public, and shall reflect a well-reasoned application of how the Dispute was resolved in compliance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as understood in light of prior IRP decisions decided under the same (or an equivalent prior) version of the provision of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws at issue, and norms of applicable law.</p>
<p>(w) Subject to any limitations established through the Rules of Procedure, an IRP Panel decision may be appealed to the full Standing Panel sitting en banc within sixty (60) days of issuance of such decision.</p>
<p>(x) The IRP is intended as a final, binding arbitration process.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) IRP Panel decisions are binding final decisions to the extent allowed by law unless timely and properly appealed to the en banc Standing Panel. En banc Standing Panel decisions are binding final decisions to the extent allowed by law. </p>
	<p>(ii) IRP Panel decisions and decisions of an en banc Standing Panel upon an appeal are intended to be enforceable in any court with jurisdiction over ICANN without a <em>de novo</em> review of the decision of the IRP Panel or en banc Standing Panel, as applicable, with respect to factual findings or conclusions of law.</p>
	<p>(iii) ICANN intends, agrees, and consents to be bound by all IRP Panel decisions of Disputes of Covered Actions as a final, binding arbitration.</p>
	<p>(A)Where feasible, the Board shall consider its response to IRP Panel decisions at the Board's next meeting, and shall affirm or reject compliance with the decision on the public record based on an expressed rationale. The decision of the IRP Panel, or en banc Standing Panel, shall be final regardless of such Board action, to the fullest extent allowed by law.</p>
	<p>(B)If an IRP Panel decision in a Community IRP is in favor of the EC, the Board shall comply within 30 days of such IRP Panel decision.</p>
	<p>(C)If the Board rejects an IRP Panel decision without undertaking an appeal to the en banc Standing Panel or rejects an en banc Standing Panel decision upon appeal, the Claimant or the EC may seek enforcement in a court of competent jurisdiction. In the case of the EC, the EC Administration may convene as soon as possible following such rejection and consider whether to authorize commencement of such an action. </p>
	<p>(iv) By submitting a Claim to the IRP Panel, a Claimant thereby agrees that the IRP decision is intended to be a final, binding arbitration decision with respect to such Claimant. Any Claimant that does not consent to the IRP being a final, binding arbitration may initiate a non-binding IRP if ICANN agrees; provided that such a non-binding IRP decision is not intended to be and shall not be enforceable. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>
<a name="_Ref444420998"></a>Section 4.6. <a name="_Ref445908864"></a>SPECIFIC REVIEWS</h4>
<p>(a) Review Teams and Reports</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><a name="_Ref444420999"></a>(i) Review teams will be established for each applicable review, which will include both a limited number of members and an open number of observers. The chairs of the Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees participating in the applicable review shall select a group of up to 21 review team members from among the prospective members nominated by the Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees, balanced for diversity and skill. In addition, the Board may designate one Director or Liaison to serve as a member of the review team. Specific guidance on the selection process is provided within the operating standards developed for the conduct of reviews under this <u>Section 4.6</u> (the "<strong>Operating Standards</strong>"). The Operating Standards shall be developed through community consultation, including public comment opportunities as necessary that comply with the designated practice for public comment periods within ICANN. The Operating Standards must be aligned with the following guidelines:</p>
	<p>(A)Each Supporting Organization and Advisory Committee participating in the applicable review may nominate up to seven prospective members for the review team;</p>
	<p>(B)Any Supporting Organization or Advisory Committee nominating at least one, two or three prospective review team members shall be entitled to have those one, two or three nominees selected as members to the review team, so long as the nominees meet any applicable criteria for service on the team; and</p>
	<p>(C)If any Supporting Organization or Advisory Committee has not nominated at least three prospective review team members, the Chairs of the Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees shall be responsible for the determination of whether all 21 SO/AC member seats shall be filled and, if so, how the seats should be allocated from among those nominated.</p>
	<p><a name="_Ref444421000"></a>(ii) Members and liaisons of review teams shall disclose to ICANN and their applicable review team any conflicts of interest with a specific matter or issue under review in accordance with the most recent Board-approved practices and Operating Standards. The applicable review team may exclude from the discussion of a specific complaint or issue any member deemed by the majority of review team members to have a conflict of interest. Further details on the conflict of interest practices are included in the Operating Standards.</p>
	<p>(iii) Review team decision-making practices shall be specified in the Operating Standards, with the expectation that review teams shall try to operate on a consensus basis. In the event a consensus cannot be found among the members of a review team, a majority vote of the members may be taken.</p>
	<p>(iv) Review teams may also solicit and select independent experts to render advice as requested by the review team. ICANN shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such experts for each review contemplated by this <u>Section 4.6</u> to the extent such fees and costs are consistent with the budget assigned for such review. Guidelines on how review teams are to work with and consider independent expert advice are specified in the Operating Standards.</p>
	<p>(v) Each review team may recommend that the applicable type of review should no longer be conducted or should be amended.</p>
	<p>(vi) Confidential Disclosure to Review Teams</p>
	<p>(A) To facilitate transparency and openness regarding ICANN's deliberations and operations, the review teams, or a subset thereof, shall have access to ICANN internal information and documents pursuant to the Confidential Disclosure Framework set forth in the Operating Standards (the "<strong>Confidential Disclosure Framework</strong>"). The Confidential Disclosure Framework must be aligned with the following guidelines:</p>
	<p>(1) ICANN must provide a justification for any refusal to reveal requested information. ICANN's refusal can be appealed to the Ombudsman and/or the ICANN Board for a ruling on the disclosure request.</p>
	<p>(2) ICANN may designate certain documents and information as "for review team members only" or for a subset of the review team members based on conflict of interest. ICANN's designation of documents may also be appealed to the Ombudsman and/or the ICANN Board.</p>
	<p>(3) ICANN may require review team members to sign a non-disclosure agreement before accessing documents.</p>
	<p>(vii) Reports</p>
	<p>(A) Each report of the review team shall describe the degree of consensus or agreement reached by the review team on each recommendation contained in such report. Any member of a review team not in favor of a recommendation of its review team (whether as a result of voting against a matter or objecting to the consensus position) may record a minority dissent to such recommendation, which shall be included in the report of the review team. The review team shall attempt to prioritize each of its recommendations and provide a rationale for such prioritization. </p>
	<p>(B) At least one draft report of the review team shall be posted on the Website for public review and comment. The review team must consider the public comments received in response to any posted draft report and shall amend the report as the review team deems appropriate and in the public interest before submitting its final report to the Board. The final report should include an explanation of how public comments were considered as well as a summary of changes made in response to public comments.</p>
	<p>(C) Each final report of a review team shall be published for public comment in advance of the Board's consideration. Within six months of receipt of a final report, the Board shall consider such final report and the public comments on the final report, and determine whether to approve the recommendations in the final report. If the Board does not approve any or all of the recommendations, the written rationale supporting the Board's decision shall include an explanation for the decision on each recommendation that was not approved. The Board shall promptly direct implementation of the recommendations that were approved.</p>

In addition, such policies shall apply to ICANN in its activities concerning ccTLDs.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444421274"></a><a name="IX-4.11"></a>(k) A ccNSO member shall not be bound if it provides a declaration to the ccNSO Council stating that <a name="DocXTextRef69"></a>(i) implementation of the policy would require the member to breach custom, religion, or public policy (not embodied in the applicable law described in <u>Section 10.4(j)</u>), and <a name="DocXTextRef70"></a>(ii) failure to implement the policy would not impair DNS operations or interoperability, giving detailed reasons supporting its statements. After investigation, the ccNSO Council will provide a response to the ccNSO member's declaration. If there is a ccNSO Council consensus disagreeing with the declaration, which may be demonstrated by a vote of <a name="DocXTextRef2531"></a> 14 or more members of the ccNSO Council, the response shall state the ccNSO Council's disagreement with the declaration and the reasons for disagreement. Otherwise, the response shall state the ccNSO Council's agreement with the declaration. If the ccNSO Council disagrees, the ccNSO Council shall review the situation after a six-month period. At the end of that period, the ccNSO Council shall make findings as to <a name="DocXTextRef71"></a>(A) whether the ccNSO members' implementation of the policy would require the member to breach custom, religion, or public policy (not embodied in the applicable law described in <u>Section 10.4(j)</u>) and <a name="DocXTextRef72"></a>(B) whether failure to implement the policy would impair DNS operations or interoperability. In making any findings disagreeing with the declaration, the ccNSO Council shall proceed by consensus, which may be demonstrated by a vote of <a name="DocXTextRef2530"> </a>14 or more members of the ccNSO Council.</p>

<h4>
<a name="_Ref444508482"></a> Section 13.1. EXTERNAL EXPERT ADVICE</h4>
<p><a name="_Ref444421415"></a><a name="XI-A-1.1"></a>(a) Purpose. The purpose of seeking external expert advice is to allow the policy-development process within ICANN to take advantage of existing expertise that resides in the public or private sector but outside of ICANN. In those cases where there are relevant public bodies with expertise, or where access to private expertise could be helpful, the Board and constituent bodies should be encouraged to seek advice from such expert bodies or individuals.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444421416"></a><a name="XI-A-1.2"></a>(b) Types of Expert Advisory Panels</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><a name="_Ref444421417"></a><a name="XI-A-1.2a"></a>(i) On its own initiative or at the suggestion of any ICANN body, the Board may appoint, or authorize the President to appoint, Expert Advisory Panels consisting of public or private sector individuals or entities. If the advice sought from such Panels concerns issues of public policy, the provisions of <u>Section 13.1(c)</u> shall apply.</p>
	<p><a name="_Ref444421418"></a><a name="XI-A-1.2b"></a>(ii) In addition, in accordance with <u>Section 13.1(c)</u>, the Board may refer issues of public policy pertinent to matters within ICANN's Mission to a multinational governmental or treaty organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="_Ref444421419"></a><a name="XI-A-1.3"></a>(c) Process for Seeking Advice: Public Policy Matters</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><a name="_Ref444421420"></a><a name="XI-A-1.3a"></a>(i) The Governmental Advisory Committee may at any time recommend that the Board seek advice concerning one or more issues of public policy from an external source, as set out above.</p>
	<p><a name="_Ref444421421"></a><a name="XI-A-1.3b"></a>(ii) In the event that the Board determines, upon such a recommendation or otherwise, that external advice should be sought concerning one or more issues of public policy, the Board shall, as appropriate, consult with the Governmental Advisory Committee regarding the appropriate source from which to seek the advice and the arrangements, including definition of scope and process, for requesting and obtaining that advice.</p>
	<p><a name="_Ref444421422"></a><a name="XI-A-1.3c"></a>(iii) The Board shall, as appropriate, transmit any request for advice from a multinational governmental or treaty organization, including specific terms of reference, to the Governmental Advisory Committee, with the suggestion that the request be transmitted by the Governmental Advisory Committee to the multinational governmental or treaty organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="_Ref444421423"></a><a name="XI-A-1.4"></a>(d) Process for Seeking and Advice: Other Matters. Any reference of issues not concerning public policy to an Expert Advisory Panel by the Board or President in accordance with <u>Section 13.1(b)(i)</u> shall be made pursuant to terms of reference describing the issues on which input and advice is sought and the procedures and schedule to be followed.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444421424"></a><a name="XI-A-1.5"></a>(e) Receipt of Expert Advice and its Effect. External advice pursuant to this <u>Section 13.1</u> shall be provided in written form. Such advice is advisory and not binding, and is intended to augment the information available to the Board or other ICANN body in carrying out its responsibilities.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444421425"></a><a name="XI-A-1.6"></a>(f) Opportunity to Comment. The Governmental Advisory Committee, in addition to the Supporting Organizations and other Advisory Committees, shall have an opportunity to comment upon any external advice received prior to any decision by the Board.</p>
<h4>
<a name="_Ref444422645"></a><a name="_Ref444421426"></a><a name="XI-A-2&gt;"></a> Section 13.2. TECHNICAL LIAISON GROUP</h4>
<p><a name="_Ref444421427"></a><a name="XI-A-2.1"></a>(a) Purpose. The quality of ICANN's work depends on access to complete and authoritative information concerning the technical standards that underlie ICANN's activities. ICANN's relationship to the organizations that produce these standards is therefore particularly important. The Technical Liaison Group ("<strong>TLG</strong>") shall connect the Board with appropriate sources of technical advice on specific matters pertinent to ICANN's activities.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444421428"></a><a name="XI-A-2.2"></a>(b) TLG Organizations. The TLG shall consist of four organizations: the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the International Telecommunications Union's Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T), the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and the Internet Architecture Board ("<strong>IAB</strong>").</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444421429"></a><a name="XI-A-2.3"></a>(c) Role. The role of the TLG organizations shall be to channel technical information and guidance to the Board and to other ICANN entities. This role has both a responsive component and an active "watchdog" component, which involve the following responsibilities:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><a name="_Ref444421430"></a><a name="XI-A-2.3a"></a>(i) In response to a request for information, to connect the Board or other ICANN body with appropriate sources of technical expertise. This component of the TLG role covers circumstances in which ICANN seeks an authoritative answer to a specific technical question. Where information is requested regarding a particular technical standard for which a TLG organization is responsible, that request shall be directed to that TLG organization.</p>
	<p><a name="_Ref444421431"></a><a name="XI-A-2.3b"></a>(ii) As an ongoing "watchdog" activity, to advise the Board of the relevance and progress of technical developments in the areas covered by each organization's scope that could affect Board decisions or other ICANN actions, and to draw attention to global technical standards issues that affect policy development within the scope of ICANN's Mission. This component of the TLG role covers circumstances in which ICANN is unaware of a new development, and would therefore otherwise not realize that a question should be asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="_Ref444421432"></a><a name="XI-A-2.4"></a>(d) TLG Procedures. The TLG shall not have officers or hold meetings, nor shall it provide policy advice to the Board as a committee (although TLG organizations may individually be asked by the Board to do so as the need arises in areas relevant to their individual charters). Neither shall the TLG debate or otherwise coordinate technical issues across the TLG organizations; establish or attempt to establish unified positions; or create or attempt to create additional layers or structures within the TLG for the development of technical standards or for any other purpose.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444421433"></a><a name="XI-A-2.5"></a>(e) Technical Work with the IETF. The TLG shall have no involvement with ICANN's work for the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Research Task Force, or the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), as described in the IETF-ICANN Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ratified by the Board on 10 March 2000 and any supplemental agreements thereto.</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444421434"></a><a name="XI-A-2.6"></a>(f) Individual Technical Experts. Each TLG organization shall designate two individual technical experts who are familiar with the technical standards issues that are relevant to ICANN's activities. These 8 experts shall be available as necessary to determine, through an exchange of e-mail messages, where to direct a technical question from ICANN when ICANN does not ask a specific TLG organization directly.</p>

<h4>Section 17.1. DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>ICANN shall establish a Customer Standing Committee ("<strong>CSC</strong>") to monitor PTI's performance under the IANA Naming Function Contract and IANA Naming Function SOW.</p>
<p>The mission of the CSC is to ensure continued satisfactory performance of the IANA naming function for the direct customers of the naming services. The direct customers of the naming services are top-level domain registry operators as well as root server operators and other non-root zone functions.</p>
<p>The CSC will achieve this mission through regular monitoring of the performance of the IANA naming function against the IANA Naming Function Contract and IANA Naming Function SOW and through mechanisms to engage with PTI to remedy identified areas of concern.</p>
<p>The CSC is not authorized to initiate a change in PTI through a Special IFR (as defined in <u>Section 18.1</u>), but may escalate a failure to correct an identified deficiency to the ccNSO and GNSO, which might then decide to take further action using consultation and escalation processes, which may include a Special IFR. The ccNSO and GNSO may address matters escalated by the CSC, pursuant to their operating rules and procedures.</p>
<h4>Section 17.2. COMPOSITION, APPOINTMENT, TERM AND REMOVAL</h4>
<p>(a) The CSC shall consist of:</p>

<p>(e) The CSC members and liaisons shall select from among the CSC members who will serve as the CSC's liaison to the IFRT (as defined in <u>Section 18.1</u>) and any Separation Cross-Community Working Group ("<strong>SCWG</strong>").</p>
<p>(f) Any CSC member or liaison may be removed and replaced at any time and for any reason or no reason by the organization that appointed such member or liaison.</p>
<p>(g) In addition, the Chair of the CSC may recommend that a CSC member or liaison be removed by the organization that appointed such member or liaison, upon any of the following: (i) (A) for not attending without sufficient cause a minimum of nine CSC meetings in a one-year period (or at least 75% of all CSC meetings in a one-year period if less than nine meetings were held in such one-year period) or (B) if such member or liaison has been absent for more than two consecutive meetings without sufficient cause; or (ii) for grossly inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p>(h) A vacancy on the CSC shall be deemed to exist in the event of the death, resignation or removal of any CSC member or liaison. Vacancies shall be filled by the organization(s) that appointed such CSC member or liaison. The appointing organization(s) shall provide written notice to the Secretary of its appointment to fill a vacancy, with a notification copy to the Chair of the CSC. The organization(s) responsible for filling such vacancy shall use its reasonable efforts to fill such vacancy within one month after the occurrence of such vacancy.</p>
<h4>Section 17.3.CSC CHARTER; PERIODIC REVIEW</h4>
<p>(a) The CSC shall act in accordance with its charter (the "<strong>CSC Charter</strong>").</p>
<p>(b) The effectiveness of the CSC shall be reviewed two years after the first meeting of the CSC; and then every three years thereafter. The method of review will be determined by the ccNSO and GNSO and the findings of the review will be published on the Website.</p>
<p>(c) The CSC Charter shall be reviewed by a committee of representatives from the ccNSO and the Registries Stakeholder Group selected by such organizations. This review shall commence one year after the first meeting of the CSC. Thereafter, the CSC Charter shall be reviewed by such committee of representatives from the ccNSO and the Registries Stakeholder Group selected by such organizations at the request of the CSC, ccNSO, GNSO, the Board and/or the PTI Board and/or by an IFRT in connection with an IFR.</p>
<p>(d) Amendments to the CSC Charter shall not be effective unless ratified by the vote of a simple majority of each of the ccNSO and GNSO Councils pursuant to each such organizations' procedures. Prior to any action by the ccNSO and GNSO, any recommended changes to the CSC Charter shall be subject to a public comment period that complies with the designated practice for public comment periods within ICANN. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any provision of an amendment to the CSC Charter conflicts with the terms of the Bylaws, the terms of the Bylaws shall control.</p>

<h4>
<a name="_Ref444447456"></a> Section 20.1. INDEMNIFICATION GENERALLY</h4>
<p>ICANN shall, to the maximum extent permitted by the CCC, indemnify each of its agents against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding arising by reason of the fact that any such person is or was an agent of ICANN, provided that the indemnified person's acts were done in good faith and in a manner that the indemnified person reasonably believed to be in ICANN's best interests and not criminal. For purposes of this <u> Article 20</u>, an "agent" of ICANN includes any person who is or was a Director, Officer, employee, or any other agent of ICANN (including a member of the EC, the EC Administration, any Supporting Organization, any Advisory Committee, the Nominating Committee, any other ICANN committee, or the Technical Liaison Group) acting within the scope of his or her responsibility; or is or was serving at the request of ICANN as a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. The Board may adopt a resolution authorizing the purchase and maintenance of insurance on behalf of any agent of ICANN against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the agent's status as such, whether or not ICANN would have the power to indemnify the agent against that liability under the provisions of this <u> Article 20</u>. </p>
<h4>
<a name="_Ref444447543"></a> Section 20.2. INDEMNIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO DIRECTOR REMOVAL</h4>
<p>If a Director initiates any proceeding in connection with his or her removal or recall pursuant to the Bylaws, to which a person who is a member of the leadership council (or equivalent body) of a Decisional Participant or representative of a Decisional Participant in the EC Administration is a party or is threatened to be made a party (as a party or witness) (a "<strong>Director Removal</strong> <strong>Proceeding</strong>"), ICANN shall, to the maximum extent permitted by the CCC, indemnify any such person, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Director Removal Proceeding, for actions taken by such person in his or her representative capacity within his or her Decisional Participant pursuant to the processes and procedures set forth in these Bylaws, provided that all such actions were taken by such person in good faith and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in ICANN's best interests and not criminal. The actual and reasonable legal fees of a single firm of counsel and other expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in defending against a Director Removal Proceeding shall be paid by ICANN in advance of the final disposition of such Director Removal Proceeding, provided, however, that such expenses shall be advanced only upon delivery to the Secretary of an undertaking (which shall be in writing and in a form provided by the Secretary) by such person to repay the amount of such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by ICANN. ICANN shall not be obligated to indemnify such person against any settlement of a Director Removal Proceeding, unless such settlement is approved in advance by the Board in its reasonable discretion. Notwithstanding <u>Section 20.1</u>, the indemnification provided in this <u>Section 20.2</u> shall be ICANN's sole indemnification obligation with respect to the subject matter set forth in this <u>Section 20.2</u>.</p>

<a name="_Ref444422725"></a> Section 22.7. INSPECTION</h4>
<p><a name="_Ref444422726"></a>(a) A Decisional Participant (the "<strong>Inspecting Decisional Participant</strong>") may request to inspect the accounting books and records of ICANN, as interpreted pursuant to the provisions of Section 6333 of the CCC, and the minutes of the Board or any Board Committee for a purpose reasonably related to such Inspecting Decisional Participant's interest as a Decisional Participant in the EC. The Inspecting Decisional Participant shall make such a request by providing written notice from the chair of the Inspecting Decisional Participant to the Secretary stating the nature of the documents the Inspecting Decisional Participant seeks to inspect ("<strong>Inspection Request</strong>"). Any Inspection Request must be limited to the accounting books and records of ICANN relevant to the operation of ICANN as a whole, and shall not extend to the underlying sources of such accounting books or records or to documents only relevant to a small or isolated aspect of ICANN's operations or that relate to the minutiae of ICANN's financial records or details of its management and administration (the "<strong>Permitted Scope</strong>"). Unless ICANN declines such request (as provided below), ICANN shall make the records requested under an Inspection Request available for inspection by such Inspecting Decisional Participant within 30 days of the date the Inspection Request is received by the Secretary or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. All materials and information made available by ICANN for inspection pursuant to an Inspection Request may only be used by the Inspecting Decisional Participant for purposes reasonably related to such Inspecting Decisional Participant's interest as a Decisional Participant in the EC. ICANN shall post all Inspection Requests to the Website.</p>
<p>(b) ICANN may decline an Inspection Request on the basis that such Inspection Request (i) is motivated by a Decisional Participant's financial, commercial or political interests, or those of one or more of its constituents,  (ii) relates to documents that are not reasonably related to the purpose specified in the Inspection Request or the Inspecting Decisional Participant's interest as a Decisional Participant in the EC, (iii) requests identical records provided in a prior request of such Decisional Participant, (iv) is not within the Permitted Scope, (v) relates to personnel records, (vi) relates to documents or communications covered by attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other legal privilege or (vii) relates to documents or communications that ICANN may not make available under applicable law because such documents or communications contain confidential information that ICANN is required to protect. If an Inspection Request is overly broad, ICANN may request a revised Inspection Request from the Inspecting Decisional Participant.</p>
<p>(c) Any such inspections shall be conducted at the times and locations reasonably determined by ICANN and shall not be conducted in a manner that unreasonably interferes with ICANN's operations. All such inspections shall be subject to reasonable procedures established by ICANN, including, without limitation, the number of individuals authorized to conduct any such inspection on behalf of the Inspecting Decisional Participant. ICANN may require the inspectors to sign a non-disclosure agreement. The Inspecting Decisional Participant may, at its own cost, copy or otherwise reproduce or make a record of materials inspected. ICANN may redact or determine not to provide requested materials on the same basis that such information is of a category or type described in <u>Section 22.7(b)</u>, in which case ICANN will provide the Inspecting Decisional Participant a written rationale for such redactions or determination.</p>
<p>(d) The inspection rights provided to the Decisional Participants pursuant to this <u>Section 22.7</u> are granted to the Decisional Participants and are not granted or available to any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this <u>Section 22.7</u> shall be construed as limiting the accessibility of ICANN's document information disclosure policy ("<strong>DIDP</strong>").</p>
<p>(e) If the Inspecting Decisional Participant believes that ICANN has violated the provisions of this <u>Section 22.7</u>, the Inspecting Decisional Participant may seek one or more of the following remedies: (i) appeal such matter to the Ombudsman and/or the Board for a ruling on the matter, (ii) initiate the Reconsideration Request process in accordance with <u>Section 4.2</u>, (iii) initiate the Independent Review Process in accordance with <u>Section 4.3, or</u> (iv) petition the EC to initiate (A) a Community IRP pursuant to <u>Section 4.2</u> of Annex D or (B) a Board Recall Process pursuant to <u>Section 3.3</u> of Annex D. Any determination by the Ombudsman is not binding on ICANN staff, but may be submitted by the Inspecting Decisional Participant when appealing to the Board for a determination, if necessary.</p>
<h4>
<a name="_Ref444422731"></a> Section 22.8. INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION</h4>
<p>If three or more Decisional Participants deliver to the Secretary a joint written certification from the respective chairs of each such Decisional Participant that the constituents of such Decisional Participants have, pursuant to the internal procedures of such Decisional Participants, determined that there is a credible allegation that ICANN has committed fraud or that there has been a gross mismanagement of ICANN's resources, ICANN shall retain a third-party, independent firm to investigate such alleged fraudulent activity or gross mismanagement. ICANN shall post all such certifications to the Website. The independent firm shall issue a report to the Board. The Board shall consider the recommendations and findings set forth in such report. Such report shall be posted on the Website, which may be in a redacted form as determined by the Board, in order to preserve attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other legal privilege or where such information is confidential, in which case ICANN will provide the Decisional Participants that submitted the certification a written rationale for such redactions.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref444422755"></a>(a) The Cross-Community Working Group on Enhancing ICANN Accountability ("<strong>CCWG-Accountability</strong>") was established pursuant to a charter dated 3 November 2014 ("<strong>CCWG-Accountability Charter</strong>"). The CCWG-Accountability Charter was subsequently adopted by the GNSO, ALAC, ccNSO, GAC, ASO and SSAC ("<strong>CCWG Chartering Organizations</strong>"). The CCWG-Accountability Charter as in effect on 3 November 2014 shall remain in effect throughout Work Stream 2 (as defined therein).</p>
<p><a name="_Ref444422756"></a>(b) The CCWG-Accountability recommended in its Supplemental Final Proposal on Work Stream 1 Recommendations to the Board, dated 23 February 2016 ("<strong>CCWG-Accountability Final Report</strong>") that the below matters be reviewed and developed following the adoption date of these Bylaws ("<strong>Work Stream 2 Matters</strong>"), in each case, to the extent set forth in the CCWG-Accountability Final Report:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) Improvements to ICANN's standards for diversity at all levels;</p>
	<p>(ii) ICANN staff accountability;</p>
	<p>(iii) Supporting Organization and Advisory Committee accountability, including but not limited to improved processes for accountability, transparency, and participation that are helpful to prevent capture;</p>
	<p>(iv) Improvements to ICANN's transparency, focusing on enhancements to ICANN's existing DIDP, transparency of ICANN's interactions with governments, improvements to ICANN's whistleblower policy and transparency of Board deliberations;</p>
	<p>(v) Developing and clarifying the FOI-HR (as defined in <u>Section 27.2</u>);</p>
	<p>(vi) Addressing jurisdiction-related questions, including how choice of  jurisdiction  and applicable laws for  dispute  settlement impact ICANN's accountability;</p>
	<p>(vii) Considering enhancements to the Ombudsman's role and function;</p>
	<p>(viii) Guidelines for standards of conduct presumed to be in good faith associated with exercising removal of individual Directors; and</p>
	<p>(ix) Reviewing the CEP (as set forth in <u>Section 4.3</u>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(c) As provided in the CCWG-Accountability Charter and the Board's 2014.10.16.16 resolution, the Board shall consider consensus-based recommendations from the CCWG-Accountability on Work Stream 2 Matters ("<strong>Work Stream 2 Recommendations</strong>") with the same process and criteria it committed to using to consider the CCWG-Accountability recommendations in the CCWG-Accountability Final Report (<strong>"Work Stream 1 Recommendations"</strong>). For the avoidance of doubt, that process and criteria includes:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(i) All Work Stream 2 Recommendations must further the following principles:</p>
	<p>(A)Support and enhance the multistakeholder model;</p>
	<p>(B)Maintain the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS;</p>
	<p>(C)Meet the needs and expectations of the global customers and partners of the IANA services;</p>
	<p>(D)Maintain the openness of the Internet; and</p>
	<p>(E)Not result in ICANN becoming a government-led or an inter-governmental organization.</p>
	<p>(ii) If the Board determines, by a vote of a two-thirds majority of the Board, that it is not in the global public interest to implement a Work Stream 2 Recommendation, it must initiate a dialogue with the CCWG-Accountability.</p>
	<p>(iii) The Board shall provide detailed rationale to accompany the initiation of dialogue. The Board and the CCWG-Accountability shall mutually agree upon the method (e.g., by teleconference, email or otherwise) by which the dialogue will occur. Discussions shall be held in good faith and in a timely and efficient manner in an effort to find a mutually acceptable solution.</p>
	<p>(iv) The CCWG-Accountability shall have an opportunity to address the Board's concerns and report back to the Board on further deliberations regarding the Board's concerns. The CCWG-Accountability shall discuss the Board's concerns within 30 days of the Board's initiation of the dialogue.</p>
	<p>If a Work Stream 2 Recommendation is modified by the CCWG-Accountability, the CCWG-Accountability shall submit the modified Work Stream 2 Recommendation to the Board for further consideration along with detailed rationale on how the modification addresses the concerns raised by the Board.</p>
	<p>(v) If, after the CCWG-Accountability modifies a Work Stream 2 Recommendation, the Board still believes it is not in the global public interest to implement the Work Stream 2 Recommendation, the Board may, by a vote of a two-thirds majority of the Board, send the matter back to the CCWG-Accountability for further consideration. The Board shall provide detailed rationale to accompany its action. If the Board determines not to accept a modified version of a Work Stream 2 Recommendation, unless required by its fiduciary obligations, the Board shall not establish an alternative solution on the issue addressed by the Work Stream 2 Recommendation until such time as the CCWG-Accountability and the Board reach agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(d) ICANN shall provide adequate support for work on Work Stream 2 Matters, within budgeting processes and limitations reasonably acceptable to the CCWG-Accountability.</p>
<p>(e) The Work Stream 2 Matters specifically referenced in <u>Section 27.1(b)</u> shall be the only matters subject to this <u>Section 27.1</u> and any other accountability enhancements should be developed through ICANN's other procedures.</p>
<p>(f) The outcomes of each Work Stream 2 Matter are not limited and could include a variety of recommendations or no recommendation; provided, however, that any resulting recommendations must directly relate to the matters discussed in <u>Section 27.1(b)</u>.</p>

<a name="_Ref444422772"></a> Section 27.2. <a name="_Ref444621799"></a>HUMAN RIGHTS</h4>
<p><a name="_Ref444422773"></a>(a) The Core Value set forth in <u>Section 1.2(b)(viii)</u> shall have no force or effect unless and until a framework of interpretation for human rights ("<strong>FOI-HR</strong>") is (i) approved for submission to the Board by the CCWG-Accountability as a consensus recommendation in Work Stream 2, with the CCWG Chartering Organizations having the role described in the CCWG-Accountability Charter, and (ii) approved by the Board, in each case, using the same process and criteria as for Work Stream 1 Recommendations.&gt;</p>
<p>(b) No person or entity shall be entitled to invoke the reconsideration process provided in <u>Section 4.2</u>, or the independent review process provided in <u>Section 4.3</u>, based solely on the inclusion of the Core Value set forth in <u>Section 1.2(b)(viii)</u> (i) until after the FOI-HR contemplated by <u>Section 27.2(a)</u> is in place or (ii) for actions of ICANN or the Board that occurred prior to the effectiveness of the FOI-HR.</p>

The PDP Manual and any amendments thereto are subject to a twenty-one (21) day public comment period at minimum, as well as Board oversight and review, as specified at <u>Section 11.3(d)</u>.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexA-3"></a>Section 3. <strong>Requesting an Issue Report</strong></p>
<p><em>Board Request. </em> The Board may request an Issue Report by instructing the GNSO Council ("Council") to begin the process outlined the PDP Manual. In the event the Board makes a request for an Issue Report, the Board should provide a mechanism by which the GNSO Council can consult with the Board to provide information on the scope, timing, and priority of the request for an Issue Report.</p>
<p><em>Council Request.</em> The GNSO Council may request an Issue Report by a vote of at least one-fourth (1/4) of the members of the Council of each House or a majority of one House.</p>
<p><em>Advisory Committee Request.</em> An Advisory Committee may raise an issue for policy development by action of such committee to request an Issue Report, and transmission of that request to the Staff Manager and GNSO Council.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexA-4"></a>Section 4. <strong>Creation of an Issue Report</strong></p>
<p>Within forty-five (45) calendar days after receipt of either (i) an instruction from the Board; (ii) a properly supported motion from the GNSO Council; or (iii) a properly supported motion from an Advisory Committee, the Staff Manager will create a report (a "<strong>Preliminary Issue Report</strong>").

</ol>
<p>Upon completion of the Preliminary Issue Report, the Preliminary Issue Report shall be posted on the Website for a public comment period that complies with the designated practice for public comment periods within ICANN.</p>
<p>The Staff Manager is responsible for drafting a summary and analysis of the public comments received on the Preliminary Issue Report and producing a Final Issue Report based upon the comments received. The Staff Manager should forward the Final Issue Report, along with any summary and analysis of the public comments received, to the Chair of the GNSO Council for consideration for initiation of a PDP.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexA-5"></a>Section 5. <strong>Initiation of the PDP</strong></p>
<p>The Council may initiate the PDP as follows:</p>
<p><em><u>Board Request</u></em>: If the Board requested an Issue Report, the Council, within the timeframe set forth in the PDP Manual, shall initiate a PDP. No vote is required for such action.</p>
<p><em><u>GNSO Council or Advisory Committee Requests</u></em>: The Council may only initiate the PDP by a vote of the Council. Initiation of a PDP requires a vote as set forth in Section 11.3(i)(ii) and Section 11.3(i)(iii) in favor of initiating the PDP.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexA-6"></a>Section 6. <strong>Reports</strong></p>

<p>If the PDP recommendations contained in the Final Report are approved by the GNSO Council, a Recommendations Report shall be approved by the GNSO Council for delivery to the Board.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexA-9"></a>Section 9. <strong>Board Approval Processes</strong></p>
<p>The Board will meet to discuss the GNSO Council recommendation as soon as feasible, but preferably not later than the second meeting after receipt of the Board Report from the Staff Manager. Board deliberation on the PDP Recommendations contained within the Recommendations Report shall proceed as follows:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>
<a name="AnnexA-9a"></a>Any PDP Recommendations approved by a GNSO Supermajority Vote shall be adopted by the Board unless, by a vote of more than two-thirds (2/3) of the Board, the Board determines that such policy is not in the best interests of the ICANN community or ICANN. If the GNSO Council recommendation was approved by less than a GNSO Supermajority Vote, a majority vote of the Board will be sufficient to determine that such policy is not in the best interests of the ICANN community or ICANN.</li>
	<li>
<a name="AnnexA-9b"></a>In the event that the Board determines, in accordance with paragraph a above, that the policy recommended by a GNSO Supermajority Vote or less than a GNSO Supermajority vote is not in the best interests of the ICANN community or ICANN (the Corporation), the Board shall (i) articulate the reasons for its determination in a report to the Council (the "<strong>Board Statement</strong>"); and (ii) submit the Board Statement to the Council.</li>
	<li>
<a name="AnnexA-9c"></a>The Council shall review the Board Statement for discussion with the Board as soon as feasible after the Council's receipt of the Board Statement.

	<li>
<a name="AnnexA-9d"></a>At the conclusion of the Council and Board discussions, the Council shall meet to affirm or modify its recommendation, and communicate that conclusion (the "<strong>Supplemental Recommendation</strong>") to the Board, including an explanation for the then-current recommendation. In the event that the Council is able to reach a GNSO Supermajority Vote on the Supplemental Recommendation, the Board shall adopt the recommendation unless more than two-thirds (2/3) of the Board determines that such policy is not in the interests of the ICANN community or ICANN.

<a name="annexA1"></a><strong>Annex A-1: GNSO Expedited Policy Development Process<a name="_Toc451769387"></a></strong>
</h3>
<p>The following process shall govern the specific instances where the GNSO Council invokes the GNSO Expedited Policy Development Process ("<strong>EPDP</strong>"). The GNSO Council may invoke the EPDP in the following limited circumstances: (1) to address a narrowly defined policy issue that was identified and scoped after either the adoption of a GNSO policy recommendation by the Board or the implementation of such an adopted recommendation; or (2) to create new or additional recommendations for a specific policy issue that had been substantially scoped previously such that extensive, pertinent background information already exists, e.g. (a) in an Issue Report for a possible PDP that was not initiated; (b) as part of a previous PDP that was not completed; or (c) through other projects such as a GGP. The following process shall be in place until such time as modifications are recommended to and approved by the Board. Where a conflict arises in relation to an EPDP between the PDP Manual (see <u>Annex 2</u> of the GNSO Operating Procedures) and the procedures described in this <u>Annex A-1</u>, the provisions of this <u>Annex A-1</u> shall prevail.</p>
<p>The role of the GNSO is outlined in <u>Article 11</u> of these Bylaws. Provided the Council believes and documents via Council vote that the above-listed criteria are met, an EPDP may be initiated to recommend an amendment to an existing Consensus Policy; however, in all cases where the GNSO is conducting policy-making activities that do not meet the above criteria as documented in a Council vote, the Council should act through a Policy Development Process (see <u>Annex A</u>).</p>
<p>Section 1.<strong> Required Elements of a GNSO Expedited Policy Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The following elements are required at a minimum to develop expedited GNSO policy recommendations, including recommendations that could result in amendments to an existing Consensus Policy, as part of a GNSO Expedited Policy Development Process:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Formal initiation of the GNSO Expedited Policy Development Process by the GNSO Council, including an EPDP scoping document;</li>
	<li>Formation of an EPDP Team or other designated work method;</li>
	<li>Initial Report produced by an EPDP Team or other designated work method;</li>
	<li>Final EPDP Policy Recommendation(s) Report produced by an EPDP Team, or other designated work method, and forwarded to the Council for deliberation;</li>
	<li>GNSO Council approval of EPDP Policy Recommendations contained in the Final EPDP Policy Recommendation(s) Report, by the required thresholds;</li>
	<li>EPDP Recommendations and Final EPDP Recommendation(s) Report forwarded to the Board through a Recommendations Report approved by the Council; and</li>
	<li>Board approval of EPDP Recommendation(s).</li>
</ol>
<p>Section 2.<strong> Expedited Policy Development Process Manual </strong></p>
<p>The GNSO shall include a specific section(s) on the EPDP process as part of its maintenance of the GNSO Policy Development Process Manual (PDP Manual), described in Annex 5 of the GNSO Operating Procedures. The EPDP Manual shall contain specific additional guidance on completion of all elements of an EPDP, including those elements that are not otherwise defined in these Bylaws. The E PDP Manual and any amendments thereto are subject to a twenty-one (21) day public comment period at minimum, as well as Board oversight and review, as specified at <u> Section 11.3(d)</u> .</p>
<p>Section 3. <strong>Initiation of the EPDP</strong></p>
<p>The Council may initiate an EPDP as follows:</p>
<p>The Council may only initiate the EPDP by a vote of the Council. Initiation of an EPDP requires an affirmative Supermajority vote of the Council (as defined in <u>Section 11.3(i)(xii)</u> of these Bylaws) in favor of initiating the EPDP.</p>
<p>The request to initiate an EPDP must be accompanied by an EPDP scoping document, which is expected to include at a minimum the following information:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Name of Council Member / SG / C;</li>
	<li>Origin of issue (e.g. previously completed PDP); </li>
	<li>Scope of the effort (detailed description of the issue or question that the EPDP is expected to address); </li>
	<li>Description of how this issue meets the criteria for an EPDP, i.e. how the EPDP will address either: (1) a narrowly defined policy issue that was identified and scoped after either the adoption of a GNSO policy recommendation by the Board or the implementation of such an adopted recommendation, or (2) new or additional policy recommendations on a specific GNSO policy issue that had been scoped previously as part of a PDP that was not completed or other similar effort, including relevant supporting information in either case; </li>
	<li>If not provided as part of item 4, the opinion of the ICANN General Counsel as to whether the issue proposed for consideration is properly within the scope of the Mission, policy process and more specifically the role of the GNSO; </li>
	<li>Proposed EPDP mechanism (e.g. WG, DT, individual volunteers); </li>
	<li>Method of operation, if different from GNSO Working Group Guidelines; </li>
	<li>Decision-making methodology for EPDP mechanism, if different from GNSO Working Group Guidelines; </li>
	<li>Target completion date. </li>
</ol>
<p>Section 4. <strong>Council Deliberation </strong></p>
<p>Upon receipt of an EPDP Final Recommendation(s) Report, whether as the result of an EPDP Team or otherwise, the Council chair will (i) distribute the Final EPDP Recommendation(s) Report to all Council members; and (ii) call for Council deliberation on the matter in accordance with the PDP Manual.</p>
<p>Approval of EPDP Recommendation(s) requires an affirmative vote of the Council meeting the thresholds set forth in <u>Section 11.3(i)(xiv)</u> and <u>(xv)</u>, as supplemented by the PDP Manual.</p>
<p>Section 5.<strong> Preparation of the Board Report </strong></p>
<p>If the EPDP Recommendation(s) contained in the Final EPDP Recommendation(s) Report are approved by the GNSO Council, a Recommendation(s) Report shall be approved by the GNSO Council for delivery to the Board.</p>
<p>Section 6.<strong> Board Approval Processes </strong></p>
<p>The Board will meet to discuss the EPDP recommendation(s) as soon as feasible, but preferably not later than the second meeting after receipt of the Recommendations Report from the Staff Manager. Board deliberation on the EPDP Recommendations contained within the Recommendations Report shall proceed as follows:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Any EPDP Recommendations approved by a GNSO Supermajority Vote shall be adopted by the Board unless, by a vote of more than two-thirds (2/3) of the Board, the Board determines that such policy is not in the best interests of the ICANN community or ICANN. If the GNSO Council recommendation was approved by less than a GNSO Supermajority Vote, a majority vote of the Board will be sufficient to determine that such policy is not in the best interests of the ICANN community or ICANN.</li>
	<li>In the event that the Board determines, in accordance with paragraph a above, that the proposed EPDP Recommendations are not in the best interests of the ICANN community or ICANN (the Corporation), the Board shall (i) articulate the reasons for its determination in a report to the Council (the "Board Statement"); and (ii) submit the Board Statement to the Council.</li>
	<li>The Council shall review the Board Statement for discussion with the Board as soon as feasible after the Council's receipt of the Board Statement. The Board shall determine the method (e.g., by teleconference, e-mail, or otherwise) by which the Council and Board will discuss the Board Statement. </li>
</ol>
<p>At the conclusion of the Council and Board discussions, the Council shall meet to affirm or modify its recommendation, and co mmunicate that conclusion (the "Supplemental Recommendation") to the Board, including an explanation for the then-current recommendation. In the event that the Council is able to reach a GNSO Supermajority Vote on the Supplemental Recommendation, the Board shall adopt the recommendation unless more than two-thirds (2/3) of the Board determines that such guidance is not in the interests of the ICANN community or ICANN. For any Supplemental Recommendation approved by less than a GNSO Supermajority Vote, a majority vote of the Board shall be sufficient to determine that the guidance in the Supplemental Recommendation is not in the best interest of the ICANN community or ICANN.</p>
<p>Section 7. <strong>Implementation of Approved Policies </strong></p>
<p>Upon a final decision of the Board adopting the EPDP recommendations, the Board shall, as appropriate, give authorization or direction to ICANN staff to implement the EPDP Recommendations. If deemed necessary, the Board shall direct ICANN staff to work with the GNSO Council to create a guidance implementation plan, based upon the guidance recommendations identified in the Final EPDP Recommendation(s) Report.</p>
<p>Section 8.<strong> Maintenance of Records </strong></p>
<p>Throughout the EPDP, from initiation to a final decision by the Board, ICANN will maintain on the Website, a status web page detailing the progress of each EPDP issue. Such status page will outline the completed and upcoming steps in the EPDP process, and contain links to key resources (e.g. Reports, Comments Fora, EPDP Discussions, etc.).</p>

</h3>
<p>The following process shall govern the ccNSO policy-development process ("<strong>PDP</strong>").</p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-1"></a><strong>1. Request for an Issue Report</strong></p>
<p>An Issue Report may be requested by any of the following:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">

</ol>
<p>Any request for an Issue Report must be in writing and must set out the issue upon which an Issue Report is requested in sufficient detail to enable the Issue Report to be prepared. It shall be open to the Council to request further information or undertake further research or investigation for the purpose of determining whether or not the requested Issue Report should be created.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-2"></a><strong>2. Creation of the Issue Report and Initiation Threshold</strong></p>
<p>Within seven days after an affirmative vote as outlined in Item <a name="DocXTextRef119"></a>1(a) above or the receipt of a request as outlined in Items <a name="DocXTextRef120"></a>1 (b), <a name="DocXTextRef121"></a>(c), or <a name="DocXTextRef122"></a>(d) above the Council shall appoint an Issue Manager. The Issue Manager may be a staff member of ICANN (in which case the costs of the Issue Manager shall be borne by ICANN) or such other person or persons selected by the Council (in which case the ccNSO shall be responsible for the costs of the Issue Manager).</p>
<p>Within fifteen (15) calendar days after appointment (or such other time as the Council shall, in consultation with the Issue Manager, deem to be appropriate), the Issue Manager shall create an Issue Report. Each Issue Report shall contain at least the following:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>
<a name="AnnexB-2.a"></a>The proposed issue raised for consideration;</li>
	<li>
<a name="AnnexB-2.b"></a>The identity of the party submitting the issue;</li>

	<li>
<a name="AnnexB-2.e"></a>A recommendation from the Issue Manager as to whether the Council should move to initiate the PDP for this issue (the "<strong>Manager Recommendation</strong>"). Each Manager Recommendation shall include, and be supported by, an opinion of the ICANN General Counsel regarding whether the issue is properly within the scope of the ICANN policy process and within the scope of the ccNSO. In coming to his or her opinion, the General Counsel shall examine whether:
		<p><a name="AnnexB-2.e.1"></a> 1) The issue is within the scope of the Mission; </p>
		<p><a name="AnnexB-2.e.2"></a> 2) Analysis of the relevant factors according to <u></u><u> Section 10.6(b)</u>   and <u>Annex C</u> affirmatively demonstrates that the issue is within the scope of the ccNSO; </p>
		<p>In the event that the General Counsel reaches an opinion in the affirmative with respect to points <a name="DocXTextRef2534"></a> 1 and <a name="DocXTextRef2533"></a> 2 above then the General Counsel shall also consider whether the issue:</p>
		<p><a name="AnnexB-2.e.3"></a> 3) Implicates or affects an existing ICANN policy; </p>
		<p><a name="AnnexB-2.3.4"></a> 4) Is likely to have lasting value or applicability, albeit with the need for occasional updates, and to establish a guide or framework for future decision-making. </p>
		<p>In all events, consideration of revisions to the ccPDP (this <u>Annex B</u>) or to the scope of the ccNSO (<u>Annex C</u>) shall be within the scope of ICANN and the ccNSO.</p>
		<p>In the event that General Counsel is of the opinion the issue is not properly within the scope of the ccNSO Scope, the Issue Manager shall inform the Council of this opinion. If after an analysis of the relevant factors according to <u>Section 10.6</u> and <u>Annex C</u> a majority of <a name="DocXTextRef2539"></a> 10 or more Council members is of the opinion the issue is within scope the Chair of the ccNSO shall inform the Issue Manager accordingly. General Counsel and the ccNSO Council shall engage in a dialogue according to agreed rules and procedures to resolve the matter. In the event no agreement is reached between General Counsel and the Council as to whether the issue is within or outside Scope of the ccNSO then by a vote of <a name="DocXTextRef2538"> </a>15 or more members the Council may decide the issue is within scope. The Chair of the ccNSO shall inform General Counsel and the Issue Manager accordingly. The Issue Manager shall then proceed with a recommendation whether or not the Council should move to initiate the PDP including both the opinion and analysis of General Counsel and Council in the Issues Report.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><a name="AnnexB-2.f"></a>In the event that the Manager Recommendation is in favor of initiating the PDP, a proposed time line for conducting each of the stages of PDP outlined herein ("<strong>PDP Time Line</strong>").</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><a name="AnnexB-2.g"></a>g. If possible, the issue report shall indicate whether the resulting output is likely to result in a policy to be approved by the Board. In some circumstances, it will not be possible to do this until substantive discussions on the issue have taken place. In these cases, the issue report should indicate this uncertainty. Upon completion of the Issue Report, the Issue Manager shall distribute it to the full Council for a vote on whether to initiate the PDP.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="AnnexB-3"></a><strong>3. Initiation of PDP</strong></p>
<p>The Council shall decide whether to initiate the PDP as follows:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>
<a name="AnnexB-3.a"></a>Within 21 days after receipt of an Issue Report from the Issue Manager, the Council shall vote on whether to initiate the PDP.

</ol>
<p>The Council shall also, by a majority vote of members present at the meeting or voting by e-mail, approve or amend and approve the PDP Time Line set out in the Issue Report.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-5"></a><strong>5. Composition and Selection of Task Forces</strong></p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>
<a name="AnnexB-5.a"></a>Upon voting to appoint a task force, the Council shall invite each of the Regional Organizations (see <u>Section 10.5</u>) to appoint two individuals to participate in the task force (the "<strong>Representatives</strong>"). Additionally, the Council may appoint up to three advisors (the "<strong>Advisors</strong>") from outside the ccNSO and, following formal request for GAC participation in the Task Force, accept up to two Representatives from the Governmental Advisory Committee to sit on the task force. The Council may increase the number of Representatives that may sit on a task force in its discretion in circumstances that it deems necessary or appropriate.</li>
	<li>
<a name="AnnexB-5.b"></a>Any Regional Organization wishing to appoint Representatives to the task force must provide the names of the Representatives to the Issue Manager within ten (10) calendar days after such request so that they are included on the task force. Such Representatives need not be members of the Council, but each must be an individual who has an interest, and ideally knowledge and expertise, in the subject matter, coupled with the ability to devote a substantial amount of time to the task force's activities.</li>
	<li>
<a name="AnnexB-5.c"></a>The Council may also pursue other actions that it deems appropriate to assist in the PDP, including appointing a particular individual or organization to gather information on the issue or scheduling meetings for deliberation or briefing. All such information shall be submitted to the Issue Manager in accordance with the PDP Time Line.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="AnnexB-6"></a><strong>6. Public Notification of Initiation of the PDP and Comment Period</strong></p>
<p>After initiation of the PDP, ICANN shall post a notification of such action to the Website and to the other ICANN Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees. A comment period (in accordance with the PDP Time Line, and ordinarily at least 21 days long) shall be commenced for the issue. Comments shall be accepted from ccTLD managers, other Supporting Organizations, Advisory Committees, and from the public. The Issue Manager, or some other designated Council representative shall review the comments and incorporate them into a report (the "<strong>Comment Report</strong>") to be included in either the Preliminary Task Force Report or the Initial Report, as applicable.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-7"></a><strong>7. Task Forces</strong></p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-7.a"></a>a. <em>Role of Task Force.</em> If a task force is created, its role shall be responsible for (i) gathering information documenting the positions of the ccNSO members within the Geographic Regions and other parties and groups; and (ii) otherwise obtaining relevant information that shall enable the Task Force Report to be as complete and informative as possible to facilitate the Council's meaningful and informed deliberation.</p>
<p>The task force shall not have any formal decision-making authority. Rather, the role of the task force shall be to gather information that shall document the positions of various parties or groups as specifically and comprehensively as possible, thereby enabling the Council to have a meaningful and informed deliberation on the issue.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-7.b"></a>b. <em>Task Force Charter or Terms of Reference.</em> The Council, with the assistance of the Issue Manager, shall develop a charter or terms of reference for the task force (the "<strong>Charter</strong>") within the time designated in the PDP Time Line. Such Charter shall include:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
<a name="AnnexB-7.b.1"></a> The issue to be addressed by the task force, as such issue was articulated for the vote before the Council that initiated the PDP; </li>
	<li>
<a name="AnnexB-7.b.2"></a> The specific time line that the task force must adhere to, as set forth below, unless the Council determines that there is a compelling reason to extend the timeline; and </li>
	<li>
<a name="AnnexB-7.b.3"></a> Any specific instructions from the Council for the task force, including whether or not the task force should solicit the advice of outside advisors on the issue. </li>
</ol>
<p>The task force shall prepare its report and otherwise conduct its activities in accordance with the Charter. Any request to deviate from the Charter must be formally presented to the Council and may only be undertaken by the task force upon a vote of a majority of the Council members present at a meeting or voting by e-mail. The quorum requirements of <u>Section 10.3(n)</u> shall apply to Council actions under this Item <a name="DocXTextRef130"></a>7(b).</p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-7.c"></a>c. <em>Appointment of Task Force Chair.</em> The Issue Manager shall convene the first meeting of the task force within the time designated in the PDP Time Line. At the initial meeting, the task force members shall, among other things, vote to appoint a task force chair. The chair shall be responsible for organizing the activities of the task force, including compiling the Task Force Report. The chair of a task force need not be a member of the Council.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-7.d"></a>d. <em>Collection of Information</em>.</p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-7.d.1"></a> 1. <em>Regional Organization Statements.</em> The Representatives shall each be responsible for soliciting the position of the Regional Organization for their Geographic Region, at a minimum, and may solicit other comments, as each Representative deems appropriate, including the comments of the ccNSO members in that region that are not members of the Regional Organization, regarding the issue under consideration. The position of the Regional Organization and any other comments gathered by the Representatives should be submitted in a formal statement to the task force chair (each, a "<strong>Regional Statement</strong>") within the time designated in the PDP Time Line. Every Regional Statement shall include at least the following: </p>
<p>
</p>
<p> <a name="AnnexB-7.d.1.i"></a> (i) If a Supermajority Vote (as defined by the Regional Organization) was reached, a clear statement of the Regional Organization's position on the issue; </p>
<p> <a name="AnnexB-7.d.1.ii"></a> (ii) If a Supermajority Vote was not reached, a clear statement of all positions espoused by the members of the Regional Organization; </p>
<p> <a name="AnnexB-7.d.1.iii"></a> (iii) A clear statement of how the Regional Organization arrived at its position(s). Specifically, the statement should detail specific meetings, teleconferences, or other means of deliberating an issue, and a list of all members who participated or otherwise submitted their views; </p>
<p> <a name="AnnexB-7.d.1.iv"></a> (iv) A statement of the position on the issue of any ccNSO members that are not members of the Regional Organization; </p>
<p> <a name="AnnexB-7.d.1.v"></a> (v) An analysis of how the issue would affect the Region, including any financial impact on the Region; and </p>
<p> <a name="AnnexB-7.d.1.vi"></a> (vi) An analysis of the period of time that would likely be necessary to implement the policy. </p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-7.d.2"></a><em> 2. Outside Advisors.</em> The task force may, in its discretion, solicit the opinions of outside advisors, experts, or other members of the public. Such opinions should be set forth in a report prepared by such outside advisors, and (i) clearly labeled as coming from outside advisors; (ii) accompanied by a detailed statement of the advisors' <a name="DocXTextRef131"></a>(a) qualifications and relevant experience and <a name="DocXTextRef132"></a>(b) potential conflicts of interest. These reports should be submitted in a formal statement to the task force chair within the time designated in the PDP Time Line. </p>
<p><a name="AnnexB-7.e"></a>e. <em>Task Force Report.</em> The chair of the task force, working with the Issue Manager, shall compile the Regional Statements, the Comment Report, and other information or reports, as applicable, into a single document ("<strong>Preliminary Task Force Report</strong>") and distribute the Preliminary Task Force Report to the full task force within the time designated in the PDP Time Line. The task force shall have a final task force meeting to consider the issues and try and reach a Supermajority Vote. After the final task force meeting, the chair of the task force and the Issue Manager shall create the final task force report (the "<strong>Task Force Report</strong>") and post it on the Website and to the other ICANN Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees. Each Task Force Report must include:</p>
<ol>
	<li> <a name="AnnexB-7.e.1"></a> A clear statement of any Supermajority Vote (being 66% of the task force) position of the task force on the issue; </li>
	<li> <a name="AnnexB-7.e.2"></a> If a Supermajority Vote was not reached, a clear statement of all positions espoused by task force members submitted within the time line for submission of constituency reports. Each statement should clearly indicate (i) the reasons underlying the position and (ii) the Regional Organizations that held the position; </li>
	<li> <a name="AnnexB-7.e.3"></a> An analysis of how the issue would affect each Region, including any financial impact on the Region; </li>
	<li> <a name="AnnexB-7.e.4"></a> An analysis of the period of time that would likely be necessary to implement the policy; and </li>
	<li> <a name="AnnexB-7.e.5"></a> The advice of any outside advisors appointed to the task force by the Council, accompanied by a detailed statement of the advisors' (i) qualifications and relevant experience and (ii) potential conflicts of interest. </li>

<h3>
<a name="annexC"></a><strong>Annex C: The Scope of the ccNSO</strong><a name="_Toc451769390"></a>
</h3>
<p>This <u>annex</u> describes the scope and the principles and method of analysis to be used in any further development of the scope of the ccNSO's policy-development role. As provided in <u>Section 10.6(b)</u> of the Bylaws, that scope shall be defined according to the procedures of the ccPDP.</p>
<p>The scope of the ccNSO's authority and responsibilities must recognize the complex relation between ICANN and ccTLD managers/registries with regard to policy issues. This annex shall assist the ccNSO, the ccNSO Council, and the Board and staff in delineating relevant global policy issues.</p>
<p><em>Policy areas</em></p>
<p>The ccNSO's policy role should be based on an analysis of the following functional model of the DNS:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Data is registered/maintained to generate a zone file,</li>
	<li>A zone file is in turn used in TLD name servers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within a <strong>TLD</strong> two functions have to be performed (these are addressed in greater detail below):</p>
<ol>
	<li>Entering data into a database ("<strong>Data Entry Function</strong>") and</li>
	<li> Maintaining and ensuring upkeep of name-servers for the TLD ("<strong>Name Server Function</strong>").</li>
</ol>
<p>These two core functions must be performed at the ccTLD registry level as well as at a higher level (IANA function and root servers) and at lower levels of the DNS hierarchy. This mechanism, as RFC 1591 points out, is recursive:</p>
<p>There are no requirements on sub domains of top-level domains beyond the requirements on higher-level domains themselves. That is, the requirements in this memo are applied recursively. In particular, all sub domains shall be allowed to operate their own domain name servers, providing in them whatever information the sub domain manager sees fit (as long as it is true and correct).</p>
<p><em>The Core Functions</em></p>
<p><a name="AnnexC-1"></a>1. Data Entry Function (DEF):</p>
<p>Looking at a more detailed level, the first function (entering and maintaining data in a database) should be fully defined by a naming policy. This naming policy must specify the rules and conditions:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>
<a name="AnnexC-1.a"></a>under which data will be collected and entered into a database or data changed (at the TLD level among others, data to reflect a transfer from registrant to registrant or changing registrar) in the database. </li>
	<li>
<a name="AnnexC-1.b"></a>for making certain data generally and publicly available (be it, for example, through Whois or nameservers). </li>
</ol>
<p><a name="AnnexC-2"></a>2. The Name-Server Function (NSF)</p>
<p>The name-server function involves essential interoperability and stability issues at the heart of the domain name system. The importance of this function extends to nameservers at the ccTLD level, but also to the root servers (and root-server system) and nameservers at lower levels.</p>
<p>On its own merit and because of interoperability and stability considerations, properly functioning nameservers are of utmost importance to the individual, as well as to the local and the global Internet communities.</p>
<p>With regard to the nameserver function, therefore, policies need to be defined and established. Most parties involved, including the majority of ccTLD registries, have accepted the need for common policies in this area by adhering to the relevant RFCs, among others RFC 1591.</p>
<p><em>Respective Roles with Regard to Policy, Responsibilities, and Accountabilities</em></p>
<p>It is in the interest of ICANN and ccTLD managers to ensure the stable and proper functioning of the domain name system. ICANN and the ccTLD registries each have a distinctive role to play in this regard that can be defined by the relevant policies. The scope of the ccNSO cannot be established without reaching a common understanding of the allocation of authority between ICANN and ccTLD registries.</p>
<p>Three roles can be distinguished as to which responsibility must be assigned on any given issue:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Policy role: i.e. the ability and power to define a policy;</li>
	<li>Executive role: i.e. the ability and power to act upon and implement the policy; and</li>
	<li>Accountability role: i.e. the ability and power to hold the responsible entity accountable for exercising its power.</li>
</ul>
<p>Firstly, responsibility presupposes a policy and this delineates the policy role. Depending on the issue that needs to be addressed those who are involved in defining and setting the policy need to be determined and defined. Secondly, this presupposes an executive role defining the power to implement and act within the boundaries of a policy. Finally, as a counter-balance to the executive role, the accountability role needs to defined and determined.</p>
<p>The information below offers an aid to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>delineate and identify specific policy areas;</li>
	<li> define and determine roles with regard to these specific policy areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>This annex defines the scope of the ccNSO with regard to developing policies. The scope is limited to the policy role of the ccNSO policy-development process for functions and levels explicitly stated below. It is anticipated that the accuracy of the assignments of policy, executive, and accountability roles shown below will be considered during a scope-definition ccPDP process.</p>
<p><em>Name Server Function (as to ccTLDs)</em></p>
<p>Level 1: Root Name Servers<br>
	Policy role: IETF, RSSAC (ICANN)<br>
	Executive role: Root Server System Operators<br>

The process set forth in this <u>Section 2.2</u> of this <u>Annex D</u> as it relates to a particular Rejection Action is referred to herein as the "<strong>Rejection Process</strong>."</p>
<p>(b) During the period beginning on the Rejection Action Board Notification Date and ending at 11:59 p.m. (as calculated by local time at the location of ICANN's principal office) on the date that is the 21<sup>st</sup> day after the Rejection Action Board Notification Date (as it relates to a particular Rejection Action, the "<strong>Rejection Action</strong> <strong>Petition Period</strong>"), subject to the procedures and requirements developed by the applicable Decisional Participant, an individual may submit a petition to a Decisional Participant, seeking to reject the Rejection Action and initiate the Rejection Process (a "<strong>Rejection Action</strong> <strong>Petition</strong>").</p>
<p>(c) A Decisional Participant that has received a Rejection Action Petition shall either accept or reject such Rejection Action Petition; provided that a Decisional Participant may only accept such Rejection Action Petition if it was received by such Decisional Participant during the Rejection Action Petition Period.</p>
<blockquote>

The Rejection Action Petition Notice shall also include:</p>
	<p>(A) the rationale upon which rejection of the Rejection Action is sought. Where the Rejection Action Petition Notice relates to an ICANN Budget, an IANA Budget, an Operating Plan or a Strategic Plan, the Rejection Action Petition Notice shall not be valid and shall not be accepted by the EC Administration unless the rationale set forth in the Rejection Action Petition Notice is based on one or more significant issues that were specifically raised in the applicable public comment period(s) relating to perceived inconsistencies with the Mission, purpose and role set forth in ICANN's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the global public interest, the needs of ICANN's stakeholders, financial stability, or other matter of concern to the community; and</p>
	<p>(B) where the Rejection Action Petition Notice relates to a Standard Bylaw Amendment, a statement, if applicable, that the Standard Bylaw Amendment is based solely on the outcome of a PDP, citing the specific PDP and the provision in the Standard Bylaw Amendment subject to the Board Notice that implements such PDP ("<strong>PDP Standard Bylaw Statement</strong>") and the name of the Supporting Organization that is a Decisional Participant that undertook the PDP relating to the Standard Bylaw Amendment ("<strong>Standard Bylaw Amendment</strong> <strong>PDP Decisional Participant</strong>").</p>

	<p>(ii) If the EC Administration has not received a Rejection Action Petition Notice pursuant to <u>Section 2.2(c)(i)</u> of this <u>Annex D</u> during the Rejection Action Petition Period, the Rejection Process shall automatically be terminated and the EC Administration shall, within twenty-four (24) hours of the expiration of the Rejection Action Petition Period, deliver to the Secretary a notice certifying that the Rejection Process has been terminated with respect to the Rejection Action contained in the Approval Notice ("<strong>Rejection Process Termination Notice</strong>"). ICANN shall promptly post such Rejection Process Termination Notice on the Website.</p>

	<p>(B) contact information for at least one representative who has been designated by the Rejection Action Petitioning Decisional Participant who shall act as a liaison with respect to the Rejection Action Supported Petition;</p>
	<p>(C) a statement as to whether or not the Rejection Action Petitioning Decisional Participant and/or the Rejection Action Supporting Decisional Participant requests that ICANN organize a publicly-available conference call prior to the Rejection Action Community Forum (as defined in <u>Section 2.3</u> of this <u>Annex D</u>) for the community to discuss the Rejection Action Supported Petition;</p>
	<p>(D) a statement as to whether the Rejection Action Petitioning Decisional Participant and the Rejection Action Supporting Decisional Participant have determined to hold the Rejection Action Community Forum during the next scheduled ICANN public meeting, taking into account the limitation on holding such a Rejection Action Community Forum when the Rejection Action Supported Petition relates to an ICANN Budget or IANA Budget as described in <u>Section 2.3(c)</u> of this <u>Annex D</u>; and</p>

	<p>The Rejection Process shall thereafter continue for such Rejection Action Supported Petition pursuant to <u>Section 2.3</u> of this <u>Annex D</u>. The foregoing process may result in more than one Rejection Action Supported Petition relating to the same Rejection Action.</p>
	<p>(ii) The Rejection Process shall automatically be terminated and the EC Administration shall, within twenty-four (24) hours of the expiration of the Rejection Action Petition Support Period, deliver to the Secretary a Rejection Process Termination Notice, which ICANN shall promptly post on the Website, if:</p>

<a name="annexE"></a><strong>Annex E: Caretaker ICANN Budget Principles<a name="_Toc451769396"></a></strong>
</h3>
<ol start="1" type="1">
	<li>Principles</li>
</ol>
<p>The caretaker ICANN budget (the "<strong>Caretaker ICANN Budget</strong>") is defined as an annual operating plan and budget that is established by the CFO in accordance with the following principles (the "<strong>Caretaker ICANN Budget Principles</strong>"):</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
	<ol start="1" type="a">
		<li>It is based on then-current ICANN operations;</li>
		<li>It allows ICANN to "take good care" and not expose itself to additional enterprise risk(s) as a result of the rejection of an ICANN Budget by the EC pursuant to the Bylaws;</li>
		<li>It allows ICANN to react to emergency situations in a fashion that preserves the continuation of its operations;</li>
		<li>It allows ICANN to abide by its existing obligations (including Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and contracts, as well as those imposed under law);</li>
		<li>It enables ICANN to avoid waste of its resources during the rejection period (i.e., the period between when an ICANN Budget is rejected by the EC pursuant to the Bylaws and when an ICANN Budget becomes effective in accordance with the Bylaws) or immediately thereafter, by being able to continue activities during the rejection period that would otherwise need to be restarted at a materially incremental cost; and</li>
		<li>Notwithstanding any other principle listed above, it prevents ICANN from initiating activities that remains subject to community consideration (or for which that community consideration has not concluded) with respect to the applicable ICANN Budget, including without limitation, preventing implementation of any expenditure or undertaking any action that was the subject of the ICANN Budget that was rejected by the EC that triggered the need for the Caretaker ICANN Budget.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Examples</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of examples, to assist with the interpretation of the Caretaker ICANN Budget Principles, of what a Caretaker ICANN Budget would logically <u>include</u>:</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
	<li>Principles</li>
</ol>
<p>The caretaker IANA Budget (the "<strong>Caretaker IANA Budget</strong>") is defined as an annual operating plan and budget that is established by the CFO in accordance with the following principles (the "<strong>Caretaker IANA Budget Principles</strong>"):</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
	<ol start="1" type="a">
		<li>It is based on then-current operations of the IANA functions;</li>
		<li>It allows ICANN, in its responsibility to fund the operations of the IANA functions, to "take good care" and not expose itself to additional enterprise risk(s) as a result of the rejection of an IANA Budget by the EC pursuant to the Bylaws;</li>
		<li>It allows ICANN, in its responsibility to fund the operations of the IANA functions, to react to emergency situations in a fashion that preserves the continuation of its operations;</li>
		<li>It allows ICANN, in its responsibility to fund the operations of the IANA functions, to abide by its existing obligations (including Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and contracts, as well as those imposed under law);</li>
		<li>It allows ICANN, in its responsibility to fund the operations of the IANA functions, to avoid waste of its resources during the rejection period (i.e., the period between when an IANA Budget is rejected by the EC pursuant to the Bylaws and when an IANA Budget becomes effective in accordance with the Bylaws) or immediately thereafter, by being able to continue activities during the rejection period that would have otherwise need to be restarted at an incremental cost; and</li>
		<li>Notwithstanding any other principle listed above, it prevents ICANN, in its responsibility to fund the operations of the IANA functions, from initiating activities that remain subject to community consideration (or for which that community consultation has not concluded) with respect to the applicable IANA Budget, including without limitation, preventing implementation of any expenditure or undertaking any action that was the subject of the IANA Budget that was rejected by the EC that triggered the need for the Caretaker IANA Budget.</li>

An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a name consisting exclusively of LDH labels, such as""icann.org"" is not an IDN."</div></div></div><script src="/assets/resource_pages-b62e0da66a9e2914e4761737fc1c05aa.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">$(document).on("click", ".js-expand-menu", function() {
