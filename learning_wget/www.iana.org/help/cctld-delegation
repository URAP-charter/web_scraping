<h1>Delegating or redelegating a country-code top-level domain (ccTLD)</h1>

<p>This document provides an overall guide to the country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) delegation and redelegation
    process, and is designed to assist requestors in determining their eligibility, and in preparing formal
    requests.</p>

<h2>Background on the process</h2>

<p>The delegation and redelegation process is designed to assign or re-assign a ccTLD to a manager, taking into account
    a number of technical and public interest criteria. These criteria relate to the basic principles that the manager
    be a responsible and technically competent trustee of the domain on behalf of the national and global Internet
    communities.</p>
<p>The process is initiated when a formal request is submitted to our Root Zone Management staff. The
    request and all required documentation is then reviewed and verified by our team. After the review
    and authorisations are completed, the request is implemented as a change to the Root Zone and Root Zone
    Database.</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of the process, the new country-code domain is established, or a transfer takes place in
    the case of redelegation of an existing ccTLD.</p>

<h2>Who is involved?</h2>

<p>The delegation and redelegation process involves a number of different organisations and individuals. For
    example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <b>requestor</b>, usually the proposed manager, initiates the process by submitting a formal delegation or
        redelegation request. The requestor is the main party we interact with throughout the request, and is
        responsible for collecting much of the materials required to process the request.
    </li>
    <li>The <b>proposed manager</b> is an organisation to which delegated responsibility for the ccTLD is sought. This
        organisation must demonstrate it understands and can meet its obligations as a trustee for the domain on behalf
        of the national and global Internet communities. The term manager is synonymous with other terms, such as
        Sponsoring Organization and operator, which have been used in other documentation. In this document, we have
        standardized on manager.
    </li>
    <li><b>Significant stakeholders</b> are those parties that benefit from the operation of the ccTLD, and their
        opinions are important in assessing the public interest aspects of a request.
    </li>
    <li>The <b>respective government</b> is consulted to indicate either support or non-objection for the delegation or
        redelegation request. As a country-code represents the name of either a country or territory, the government is
        an important stakeholder in how the domain should be managed.
    </li>
    <li>We, <b>Public Technical Identifiers</b>, as the IANA naming functions operator, are responsible for the
        receipt, verification and processing of the request. Our Root Zone Management staff performs these activities.
    </li>
    <li><b>Verisign</b>, as the Root Zone Maintainer, is responsible for receiving requests that we have processed
        and implementing those changes in the root zone, and
        distributing the revised root zone to the root name servers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>While many parties are involved in processing a delegation or redelegation, our staff are the primary interface for
    those requesting a delegation or a redelegation of a ccTLD.</p>

<h2>Preparing a request</h2>

<p>A delegation or redelegation request involves the development and submission of documentation that describes the
    nature of the request, and how the proposed new manager satisfies the criteria used to assess the request.</p>

<h3>Completing a delegation request form</h3>

<p>The <a href="/domains/root/tld-change-template.txt">delegation request form</a> which describes the basic details of
    the request, must be completed. The details include the identity of the proposed manager, the contact persons to be
    listed in the Root Zone Database, the technical delegation details for the domain, and a checklist relating to the
    assessment criteria for the delegation or redelegation request.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="/help/nameserver-requirements">Technical requirements for authoritative name servers</a> for more
    information about the technical delegation details for the domain.</p>

<h3>Demonstrating string eligibility</h3>

<p>To delegate or redelegate a ccTLD, it must be shown that the string is eligible to be delegated.</p>
<p>The primary method of eligibility for country-code top-level domains is its listing as an “alpha-2” (two-letter
    ASCII) code listed in the ISO 3166-1 standard. Another method of eligibility is the string may have been deemed
    eligible as a country-code through the IDN Fast Track process.</p>
<p>Complete details on which country-codes are considered eligible are available in <a href="/help/eligible-tlds">Qualifying
    top-level domain strings</a>.</p>

<h3>Demonstrating technical and administrative competency</h3>

<p>The delegation request must include documentation that demonstrates the technical and administrative ability of the
    proposed manager to operate the domain competently and that they will not jeopardize nor compromise the stability
    and security of the DNS.</p>
<p>The proposed manager decides whom to list as the administrative and technical contacts. Both the administrative
    contact and the technical contact must cross-verify all root zone changes and be responsive to communications about
    root zone changes.</p>
<p>For more information on preparing documentation to demonstrate technical and administrative ability, please go to
    <a href="/help/operational-plans">Preparing an Operational and Technical Plan</a>.</p>

<h3>Providing information on the Proposed Manager</h3>

<p>It is a requirement that the requestor provides the legal name of the organisation (as officially registered in its
    principal place of business), along with its physical address, telephone and fax numbers. In support of this, the
    requestor must provide a certified copy or extract of the business registration, certification, or law that
    demonstrates the organisation’s legal status.</p>

<h3>Providing geographical location</h3>

<p>As country-codes represent specific countries or territories, the proposed manager will be resident or incorporated
    in, the territory and/or jurisdiction of the relevant government or public authority of the country associated with
    the ccTLD, unless formally decided otherwise by the relevant government or public authority.</p>
<p>It is a requirement that the requestor indicate the geographic locations of the proposed manager, the administrative
    contact person for the domain, and the location(s) where the principal operations will be conducted.</p>

<h3>Demonstrating consent</h3>

<p>It is a requirement that the requestor provides documentation that shows that directly involved parties consent to
    the request to delegate or redelegate. For a new delegation, this includes the proposed new organisation and contact
    persons. For an existing delegation, this also includes documented consent from the existing management of the
    domain.</p>

<h3>Demonstrating that the request serves the local Internet community’s interest</h3>

<p>The delegation or redelegation request must demonstrate that the proposed manager recognises its responsibility to
    fairly and equitably serve the local Internet community’s interests with respect to management of the domain. In
    support of this, it is a requirement that the requestor document the mechanisms that will be utilised to inform and
    seek input from the local community on ccTLD management issues.</p>
<p>It is a requirement that the requestor provide documentation indicating local Internet community support for the
    proposed manager in operating the ccTLD, such as letters of support from interested and/or impacted parties, and the
    results of public consultations that led to the request.</p>

<h3>Demonstrating government review and consideration</h3>

<p>It is a requirement that the requestor provide documentation indicating the relevant governments have been informed
    about the request. It is a requirement that the documentation includes a statement of support or non-objection from
    an authorised representative of the government.</p>

<h3>Demonstrating a stable transfer plan</h3>

<p>For the redelegation of an existing operational ccTLD, it is a requirement that the requestor provide information on
    how existing operations will be transferred to the proposed new manager in a safe manner. It must explain how the
    stability of the domain will be preserved and how existing registrants will be impacted by the change. If the
    request is in relation to a transfer from a retired ccTLD to another ccTLD, it must also describe the
    decommissioning process for the retired domain.</p>

<h2>Submitting the request</h2>

<p>Once the request has been prepared, submit it to our Root Zone Management staff to commence processing.</p>

<h3>Initial email submission</h3>

<p>To start the request, send an email with the delegation/redelegation form attached to
    <span class="email-address">root-mgmt@iana.org</span>.</p>
<p>Supporting documentation must be provided with the Delegation Request Form. Files should be in PDF format where
    possible.</p>
<p>Once the email is sent to root-mgmt@iana.org, our ticketing system will reply automatically with a confirmation
    of receipt and a unique reference number within 1 day. This number will be used to track progress and correspondence
    relating to the request. Please ensure the number, just as it appears in the confirmation receipt, is included in
    the subject of all future communications related to the request.</p>

<h3>Original documentation</h3>

<p>In addition to the electronic submissions, it is a requirement that the requester submit originals, or certified
    copies, of all official documents and testimony used in the request for which its authenticity is material to the
    evaluation. This includes the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Registration certifications</li>
    <li>Letters of support or consent</li>
    <li>Legal documents that are a basis of the application</li>
</ul>
<p>The documents should be couriered or posted to ICANN’s Root Zone Management staff at the following address. It is
    important that the documents cite the reference number that appeared in the email confirmation receipt.</p>
<blockquote>Root Zone Management<br/>12025 Waterfront Drive #300</br>Los Angeles CA 90094<br/>USA
</blockquote>
<p>Please submit all requests, templates, and documentation in English. Where accuracy is essential, English
    documentation and/or English translations of key documents (such as governmental decrees relating to the request)
    must be notarised or certified official translations.</p>

<h2>After the request is received</h2>

<p>Once we receive the request and issue a confirmation receipt, a process of analysis and verification begins. The
    amount of time this process takes varies depending upon the information provided in the supporting documentation,
    and the complexity of the individual case.</p>
<p>In the event that further documentation or clarification is needed, we will contact the requestor. The delegation or
    redelegation request will not proceed until we have received satisfactory documentation and information.</p>
<p>If we are unable to process the request due to significant lack of detail, the inability to confirm information,
    and/or unresponsiveness by the requestor, we will administratively close the request. In such cases, the requestor
    is welcome to resubmit the request at a later date to restart the review process once the additional material is
    available.</p>

<h3>Requesting confirmation from contacts</h3>

<p>In addition to verification and analysis of the material supplied in the request, for redelegation requests, we will
    ask the current administrative and technical contacts, and the current ccTLD manager, whether they agree to the
    request.</p>
<p>In the case of a delegation, we confirm with the proposed contacts as listed in the request, to ensure they
    consent to the responsibilities of being listed as a contact for the domain.</p>
<p>In those cases where confirmation is not received from one or more parties, further consultation will be necessary.
    This may delay processing of the request. Please see <a href="/help/obtaining-consent">Obtaining consent for a root
    zone change</a>.</p>

<h3>Posting the status of the pending request</h3>

<p>We will publicly post requests for delegations and redelegations. This public disclosure will at a minimum include
    the domain name being requested, the party that will manage the domain, and the current status of the request.</p>
<p>If there are specific stability or security reasons why information should not be disclosed, the requestor should
    explain that in the Delegation Request Form.</p>

<h3>Analysing the request</h3>

<p>After all materials are received, and the positions of the contacts have been ascertained, our staff performs an
    analysis of the request. If the result of the analysis is the request accords with all appropriate policies and
    procedures, it will be approved for implementation. If there are defects in the request, it will be referred back
    to the requester for further work or clarification.</p>

<h3>Implementing the request</h3>

<p>Upon referral for implementation, the Root Zone Maintainer will implement the changes to the DNS root zone. We will
    implement the data changes in the WHOIS database.</p>
<p>After the request has been implemented, we will notify the requestor, and the requestor will verify that the changes
    were made correctly. In the event any problems arise, immediately notify us at root-mgmt@iana.org and include the
    reference number of the change request.</p>
