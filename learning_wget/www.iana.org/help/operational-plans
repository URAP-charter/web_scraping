<h1>Preparing an Operational and Technical Plan</h1>

<p>This article provides additional detail on preparing an operational and technical plan as it relates to the procedure
    to delegate or redelegate a country-code top-level domain (ccTLD).</p>

<h2>General overview</h2>

<p>Our role is to review whether the proposed manager will perform its tasks with a satisfactory level of
    operational and technical competency. We primarily do this by asking a requestor to provide a technical and
    operational plan describing how the proposed manager will manage the domain.</p>
<p>It is recognised that the requirements for operating a ccTLD vary significantly by country. The operational approach
    for a small country with limited number of domains will be very different from a registry that maintains millions of
    registrations and has committed to providing a high-level of uptime, 24×7 support, and an automated registration
    interface such as an EPP-based registry.</p>
<p>The review process is not intended to enforce a particular approach on all requestors. We review the planning
    assumptions made against the proposed set up of the operation. We apply our understanding of industry norms, to
    consider if the assumptions are reasonable and if the proposed operation is likely to satisfy those assumptions. If
    the assumptions or plans appear unreasonable, we will make additional enquiries to the requestor to better
    understand the proposal.</p>
<p>Considering this assessment approach, a key part in developing a plan is documenting the assumptions and policy
    constraints that apply to the operation. For example, some of the questions to consider would be: What are the
    number of projected domains within the ccTLD that need to be managed? How many transactions are expected to be
    processed? What are the service-level obligations (for uptime, responsiveness, etc.) that the registry is committed
    to? What are the specific policy requirements that the registry is required to implement?</p>
<p>If the plans provided do not document such assumptions, or do not provide a sufficient level of detail so that the
    proposed operations can be understood, we may not be able to properly assess the technical and operational capacity
    of the proposed manager.</p>
<p>Requestors should be aware the plans are not just limited to the technical systems, but also to other resourcing of
    the proposed management of the domain. Plans should include explanations of the software, hardware, network
    architecture, staffing, expertise and facilities of the proposed manager.</p>

<h2>Specific suggestions</h2>

<p>In light of the general advice, some of the specific elements the requestor should consider providing include:</p>
<ol class="lettered-list">
    <li>description of the organisation’s structure, key personnel (financial and business officers, and other relevant
        management employees), and an overview of overall staffing;
    </li>
    <li>information on the proposed administrative and technical contacts for the domain, including their identities,
        contact details, and roles within the organisation;
    </li>
    <li>description of the proposed manager’s relevant Internet management and registry operations experience;</li>
    <li>information on the technical capabilities of the manager, including the technical plan for registry and DNS
        operations, and a description of the physical configuration of the registry, along with technical facilities;
    </li>
    <li>assurance that relevant policies will be in place to govern the operation of the domain, as to not jeopardize or
        compromise the security and stability of the DNS;
    </li>
    <li>indication that security plans and procedures will be in place, including database and physical security for the
        operation of the domain;
    </li>
    <li>indication that plans exist to cope with the requirements of scaling registry operations as required;</li>
    <li>a description of the domain registration model, such as whether a registry-registrar model, or direct
        interaction with the registry;
    </li>
    <li>indication that the requesting organisation has sufficient Internet connectivity and services capable to provide
        connectivity, redundancy and resiliency;
    </li>
    <li>description of the configuration and plan for the name server constellation that will support name resolution
        for the domain;
    </li>
    <li>description of the registry’s interfaces with the community (such as technical APIs, help desk, etc.), and how
        they will be maintained;
    </li>
    <li>information on how zone data will be generated and how public WHOIS services will be provided;</li>
    <li>information on resiliency provisions, including how system outages and other disasters will be defended against,
        as well as system recovery and escrow procedures in the event of disasters;
    </li>
    <li>indication that processes and plans are in place to ensure operations are in line with global standards,
        relevant RFCs, and best practices; and
    </li>
    <li>description of the timelines and strategies relating to deployment of the registry technical platform and
        staffing of the registry, if the registry is not already fully commissioned.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>On authoritative name server infrastructure</h2>

<p>It should be assumed there is an expectation that the authoritative name service, as a whole, must always be
    available for any top-level domain.</p>
<p>The configuration of the name servers for a top-level domain should be sufficiently well designed to assure constant
    availability against any adverse event. This includes major denial-of-service attacks and unforeseen disasters in
    the country. Even though registration activity may be impaired by such events, the name server infrastructure should
    be designed such that the ability to resolve the top-level domain’s zone should never be impacted.</p>
<p>Requestors should consider geographically and topologically diverse infrastructure that is not dependent on specific
    networks in order to achieve this goal. The advent of anycast-based approaches to name server deployment makes this
    more viable than it may have been in the past.</p>
