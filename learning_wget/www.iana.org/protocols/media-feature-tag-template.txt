   Subject: Registration of media feature tag XXXX
 
 
    | Instructions are preceded by `|'.  Some fields are optional.
 
   Media feature tag name:
 
   ASN.1 identifier associated with feature tag:       [optional]
 
    | To have IANA assign an ASN.1 identifier,
    | use the value "New assignment by IANA" here.
 
   Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag:
 
    | Include a short (no longer than 4 lines) description or summary
    | Examples:
    |   `Use of the xyzzy feature is indicated by ...'
    |   `Support of color display is indicated by ...'
    |   `Number of colors in a palette which can be defined ...'
 
   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:
 
     [ ] 1. The feature tag is Boolean and may have values of
          TRUE or FALSE.   A value of TRUE indicates an available
          capability.  A value of FALSE indicates the capability
          is not available.
 
    | If you wish to indicate two mutually exclusive possiblities
    | that cannot be expressed as the availability or lack of a
    | capability, use a two-token list, rather than a Boolean value.
 
 
     [ ] 2. The feature has an associated numeric or enumerated value.
 
 
   For case 2: Indicate the data type of the value:
 
        [ ] 2a. Signed Integer
        [ ] 2b. Rational number
        [ ] 2c. Token (equality relationship)
        [ ] 2d. Token (ordered)
        [ ] 2e. String (equality relationship)
        [ ] 2f. String (defined comparison)
 
    |IMPORTANT: You may only chose one of the above data types.
 
  (Only for case 2) Detailed description of the feature value meaning,
  and of the format and meaning of the feature tag values
  for the alternative results.
 
    | If you have selected 2d you must provide the ordering mechanism
    | or a full and ordered enumeration of possible values.  If you
    | have selected 2f, you must provide a defintion of the comparison.
    | Definitions by included reference must be to stable and readily
    | available specifications:
    |
    | If the number of alternative results is small, you may
    | enumerate the identifiers of the different results and describe
    | their meaning.
    |
    | If there is a limited useful numeric range of result (2b, 2c),
    | indicate the range.
    |
    | The identifiers of the alternative results could also be
    | described by referring to another IANA registry, for example
    | the paper sizes enumerated by the Printer MIB.
 
  The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
  applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
                                                   [optional]
 
    | For applications, also specify the number of the first version
    | which will use the tag, if applicable.
 
   Examples of typical use:                               [optional]
 
   Related standards or documents:                        [optional]
 
   Considerations particular to use in individual applications,
   protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:        [optional]
 
   Interoperability considerations:                       [optional]
 
   Security considerations:
 
     Privacy concerns, related to exposure of personal information:
 
     Denial of service concerns related to consequences of specifying
     incorrect values:

   Requested IANA publication delay:                      [optional]
 
    | A delay may only be requested for final placement in the global
    | or IETF trees, with a maximum of two months.  Organizations
    | requesting a registration with a publication delay should note
    | that this delays only the official publication of the tag
    | and does not prevent information on it from being disseminated
    | by the members of the relevant mailing list.
 
   Other information:                                     [optional]
