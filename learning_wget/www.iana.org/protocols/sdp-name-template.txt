SDP Names Template - RFC 2327

Registration Procedure

To register a name the guidelines of RFC 2327 should be followed
regarding the required level of documentation that is required.  The
registration itself should be sent to IANA.  Attribute registrations
should include the information given above.  Other registrations
should include the following additional information:
 
   o contact name, email address and telephone number
 
   o name being registered (as it will appear in SDP)
 
   o long-form name in English
 
   o type of name ("media", "proto", "fmt", "bwtype", "nettype", or
     "addrtype")
 
   o a one paragraph explanation of the purpose of the registered name.
 
   o a reference to the specification (eg RFC number) of the registered
     name.
 
IANA may refer any registration to the IESG or to any appropriate
IETF working group for review, and may request revisions to be made
before a registration will be made.
