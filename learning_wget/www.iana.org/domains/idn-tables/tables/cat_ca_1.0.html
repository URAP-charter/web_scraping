<p>
This document presents a character table created by puntCAT (.cat gTLD 
Registry) for Catalan language (sometimes also referenced as Valencian).
</p>
<p>
This table is in compliance with the ICANN Guidelines for the 
Implementation of Internationalized Domain Names and is intended for 
publication in the IANA IDN Character Table Registry.
</p>
<p>
The following characters are given in their Unicode code points in 
format U+XXXX, where X is a hexadecimal digit. The range of code points 
is expressed as U+XXXX..U+YYYY, where XXXX and YYYY are the first and 
last Unicode code point in the range.
</p>
<pre>
U+002D HYPEN-MINUS
U+0030..U+0039 DIGIT ZERO .. DIGIT 9
U+0061..U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER A .. LATIN SMALL LETTER Z
U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT
U+00E0 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH GRAVE
U+00E7 LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA
U+00E8 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH GRAVE
U+00E9 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE
U+00ED LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH ACUTE
U+00EF LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH DIAERESIS
U+00F2 LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH GRAVE
U+00F3 LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH ACUTE
U+00FA LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH ACUTE
U+00FC LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS
</pre>
<p>
The character subset that can be used in IDNs has been chosen to 
accommodate the needs of the Catalan language. After the NamePrep 
normalization process, as described in RFC 3491, following characters 
may appear in the domain name:</p>

<p>U+00E0 à U+0061 a
U+00E7 ç U+0063 c
U+00E8 è U+0065 e
U+00E9 é U+0065 e
U+00ED í U+0068 i
U+00EF ï U+0068 i
U+006C l U+00B7 · U+006C l U+006C l U+002D - U+006C l
U+00F2 ò U+006F o
U+00F3 ó U+006F o
U+00FA ú U+0075 u
U+00FC ü U+0075 u</p>

<p>Please note the following:</p>
<p>• The NamePrep process maps all characters to lowercase characters, 
therefore, upper case characters do not appear in the list</p>
<p>• the “ela geminada”, represented in Unicode as U+013F U+004C LL· 
(up-per case) resp. U+0140 U+006C ll· (lower case), is transliterated 
by the NamePrep process into the character sequence U+006C l U+00B7 · 
U+006C l which appears in the list above. Therefore, it can be used in
domain names.</p>
<p>• The character U+00B7 · (middle dot) cannot be used individually, but
only in combination with both preceding and following letter L.</p>
