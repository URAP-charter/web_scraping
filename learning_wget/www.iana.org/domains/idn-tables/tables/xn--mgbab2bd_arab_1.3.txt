1. IDN Table for the Arabic Script

TLD: ﺑﺎﺯﺍﺭ‏

Script Tag: Arab

Script Description: Arabic

Version: 1.3

Effective Date: 2015-10-21

Registry: CORE Association

Apart from the general rules defined in IDNA2008 CORE Internet Council of Registrars implements some further rules. These will be described in the following sections.

For every registered Arabic script IDN, an index (or canonical) string will be computed and stored in the SRS database. The index string is produced by applying the rules from the section below to the IDN U-label. If no rule applies or if all applying rules map their respective character to itself, then the index string will be the same as the registered string. Once an Arabic script IDN is registered, other domain names that map to the same index string will be unavailable for registration. Additionally, there are some rules that specifically prohibit a certain combination of Arabic characters within a domain label. Such labels will also be unavailable for registration.

The table presented here is in compliance with the ICANN Guidelines for the Implementation of Internationalized Domain Names Version 3.0 and is intended for publication in the IANA Repository of TLD IDN Practices, for the information of prospective holders of domains in ﺑﺎﺯﺍﺭ‏ and for the users of resources within those domains.


1.1 Table of Allowed Characters and their Joining Property

The table below lists the characters allowed in the Unicode representation of IDNs associated with the Arabic script. The second column shows the character property used in the rules below. Columns are delimited by semicolons. The "#" symbol denotes start of a comment that continues to the end of line.

1.2 Pattern Syntax

The following rules will have a pattern describing a character from the above table to be matched. Since the Arabic characters cannot be considered on a one-by-one basis, a look-behind and look-ahead pattern is (optionally) added to each rule. A rule applies to a domain label if the given pattern matches a character within the label and the characters before and after match the patterns given in look-behind and look-ahead, respectively. The terms 'before' and 'after' are considered to be in relation to the on-the-wire order of the characters.

The following character properties will be used in the patterns.

* {L} denotes characters that are left-joining
* {R} denotes characters that are right-joining
* {D} denotes characters that are dual-joining (i.e. both left- and right-joining)
* {U} denotes characters that are unable to join
* {T} denotes combining characters
* {1} denotes the ASCII digits Zero - Nine (i.e., 0030..0039)
* {2} denotes the Arabic digits Zero - Nine (i.e., 0660..0669)
* {3} denotes the extended Arabic digits Zero - Nine (i.e., 06F0..06F9)
* {} denotes the empty word (no character)
* character classes can be combined, e.g. {LD} denotes characters that are either left-joining or dual-joining

Apart from the character properties necessary for the Arabic characters, the used pattern syntax is defined by the following syntax elements which are based on the regular expression syntax.

* . denotes any character
* ^ denotes the beginning of the label
* $ denotes the end of the label
* | denotes an alternative
* (...) groups a subpattern
* an asterisk (*) denotes any number of occurrences, including zero
* ZWNJ denotes the zero width non-joiner character (U+200C)
* U+XXXX denotes the Unicode character with the hexadecimal code point XXXX


1.3 Rules Describing Invalid Labels

If any of the following rules is matched, the respective domain label is rejected and may not be registered. Note that some special cases of the rules below are already included in IDNA2008. Excluding those special cases would only have made the rules more complicated and less intuitive so they were kept.

Comment:      prevent confusion that may arise in conjunction with certain fonts
Look-behind:   
Pattern:      U+0637 | U+0638 | U+06BE
Look-ahead:   ZWNJ {T}* {RD}
Action:       reject

Comment:      a label may not start with a digit
Look-behind:  ^ 
Pattern:      {123} 
Look-ahead:
Action:       reject

Comment:      consecutive hyphens are not allowed in a label
Look-behind:  U+002D
Pattern:      U+002D
Look-ahead:
Action:       reject

Comment:      no mixing of the three digit sets is allowed (part 1)
Look-behind:  {23} .*
Pattern:      {1}
Look-ahead:
Action:       reject

Comment:      no mixing of the three digit sets is allowed (part 2)
Look-behind:  {13} .*
Pattern:      {2}
Look-ahead:
Action:       reject

Comment:      no mixing of the three digit sets is allowed (part 3)
Look-behind:  {12} .*
Pattern:      {3}
Look-ahead:
Action:       reject


1.4 Rules for Variant and Index Generation

If any of the following rules matches, the character from the pattern will have an index character. This index character is used to determine the index string for the whole label (simply by replacing each character by its index character). Furthermore, labels with at least one matching rule will have label variants. The variants are determined by replacing the character by any one of the allowed variants.

Note that for every variant, the previous rules to determine invalid labels also have to be checked to make sure a variant is a valid domain label.


1.4.1 ZWNJ IDNA2003 workaround

The rule is due to the fact that several browsers still do not support IDNA2008 in respect of the ZWNJ character. By implementing the older version IDNA2003 they simply remove any ZWNJ occurrence. The following rule removes every ZWNJ from a domain name and thus makes two domains that only differ in the appearance of ZWNJ characters variants of each other.
