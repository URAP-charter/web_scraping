IDN Table for the Hebrew Language

TLD: .sap

Language Tag: he

Language Description: Hebrew

Version: 1.0

Effective Date: 2012-04-02

Registry: SAP AG

The table below lists the characters allowed in the Unicode representation of IDNs associated with the Hebrew language. The "#" symbol denotes start of a comment that continues to the end of line.

The table presented here is in compliance with the ICANN Guidelines for the Implementation of Internationalized Domain Names Version 3.0 and is intended for publication in the IANA Repository of TLD IDN Practices, for the information of prospective holders of domains in .sap and for the users of resources within those domains. To avoid user confusion due to differing practices across TLD registries, SAP AG is using this IDN table currently in use for the already existing TLD .il, courtesy of Israeli Internet Association (ISOC-IL).

A Hebrew Domain Name label registered under .sap must meet the following requirements:

* Be comprised of characters from this table, only.
* Not contain two consecutive occurrences of, U+002D (HYPHEN-MINUS).
* Meet IDNA2008 requirements for bidirectional language labels (RFC5893); in particular, must start with a Hebrew letter and must end with a Hebrew letter or a digit.
