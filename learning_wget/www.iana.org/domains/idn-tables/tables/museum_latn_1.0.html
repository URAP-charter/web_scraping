This document contains the character table used by the .MUSEUM registry for the registration of domain names
represented using Latin script. The table is in compliance with the ICANN Guidelines for the Implementation
of Internationalized Domain Names Version 2.1, and is intended for publication in the IANA Repository of TLD
IDN Practices, for the information of prospective holders of domains in .MUSEUM and for the users of resources
within those domains. It subsumes and replaces descriptions of the character repertoires available for labels
based on several Nordic languages that were previously posted in the IANA Repository and are herewith being
archived.
</p>

<p>
The material presented here was prepared for collaborative use by the .SE registry, which is posting it
simultaneously in the IANA Repository. A detailed explanation of the derivation of the table is located at
<a href="http://about.museum/idn/museum-se-latin.pdf">http://about.museum/idn/museum-se-latin.pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>
Characters are listed in this table with their Unicode code points in U+xxxx format. The Unicode name for each
character appears to the right of the number sign "#" on the same line. A label that contains a LATIN LETTER
may not contain a letter or equivalent character from any other script, unless explicitly permitted in the IDN
character table for a language written with that script. No prescriptive policies are attached to what in a
language-specific context might be seen as character variants, and the registration of a label containing any
of the listed characters confers no rights to any other orthographically comparable form. However, all names
in .MUSEUM are individually reviewed prior to registration, and in situations where the bundling or blocking of
similar labels is deemed appropriate, the registration request may be processed accordingly. Restrictions apply
to the positions in which the U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS may appear.
