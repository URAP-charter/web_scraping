# This document describes the Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) Character Table used by {Applicant} within the {AXA} registry for the registration of {AXA} domains in the Russian language. 
# We advise registrants to carefully consider the potential confusion over the perception of equivalence between an accented Latin character and another sequence of Latin characters, with or without accents.  There exists no equivalence rule that can be applied universally as any such mappings are generally dependent on the language, culture and context in which an IDN is used. 
# {AXA} Russian Language IDN implementation has a feature that mitigates homographic attacks by blocking a name from being registered if a similar name is already registered.  For every registered Russian language IDN a canonical string will be computed and stored in the SRS database. The canonical string is produced by mapping every character in the IDN U-label into the corresponding canonical character as specified in the character table below. Once a Russian language IDN is registered, other domain names that map into the same canonical string will be unavailable for registration. Conversely, if the US ASCII registration exists then the Russian IDN label that maps to the identical canonical string is unavailable.

# The table below lists the characters allowed in the Unicode representation of IDNs associated with the Russian language. The second column shows the canonical code point corresponding to the first column. Columns are delimited with semicolons. The ‘#’ symbol denotes start of a comment that continues to the end of line.

# Note: as opposed to most other IDN languages supported in .{AXA}, the character table for the Russian language IDNs does not include US ASCII letters a to z.
# This table is in compliance with the ICANN Guidelines for the Implementation of Internationalized Domain Names and is intended for publication in the IANA IDN Character Table Registry.
