This document presents a character table used by Hostmaster Ltd for IDN registrations in Cyrillic script.
It also applies to delegations for subdomains of .UA ccTLD where IDN registrations are permitted.

The following characters are given in their Unicode code points in format U+XXXX, where X is a hexadecimal digit. 

I would like to express gratitude to NASK (.PL ccTLD registry) and Andrzej Bartosiewicz for their IDN work,
which was instrumental in this implementation, as well as to participants from local internet community.

Addition of Modifier Letter Apostrophe (U+02BC) is based on work of ICANN Variant IDN Project (cyrillic-vip) members,
including Nicholas Ostler, Alexey Mykhaylov, Vladimir Shadrunov, Oleksiy Ptashniy, Yuriy Kargapolov, and others.
