IDN Table for the Greek Language

TLD: .sap

Language Tag: el

Language Description: Greek

Version: 1.0

Effective Date: 2012-04-02

Registry: SAP AG

The .sap Greek Language IDN implementation provides a feature that mitigates homographic attacks by blocking a name from being registered if a similar name is already registered.

For every registered Greek language IDN a canonical string will be computed and stored in the SRS database. The canonical string is produced by mapping every character in the IDN U-label to the corresponding canonical character as specified in the character table below. Once a Greek language IDN is registered, other domain names that map to the same canonical string will be unavailable for registration. Conversely, if the US ASCII registration exists then the Greek IDN label that maps to the identical canonical string is unavailable.

The table below lists the characters allowed in the Unicode representation of IDNs associated with the Greek language. The second column shows the canonical code point corresponding to the first column. The third column lists the other variants that also map to the same canonical character in the second column. Columns are delimited by semicolons. The "#" symbol denotes the start of a comment that continues to the end of line.

The table presented here is in compliance with the ICANN Guidelines for the Implementation of Internationalized Domain Names Version 3.0 and is intended for publication in the IANA Repository of TLD IDN Practices, for the information of prospective holders of domains in .sap and for the users of resources within those domains. To avoid user confusion due to differing practices across TLD registries, SAP AG has created this IDN table based upon ICANN's "Study of the Issues Present in the Registration of IDN TLDs in Greek Characters," see http://archive.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtlds/greek-vip-issues-report-07oct11-en.pdf. Even though the study is about Greek character TLDs, its findings should also be used for second level domain names for consistency reasons. Especially both the accent marks and the final sigma have to be included in the allowed for registrations characters since they are paramount for the proper typing of so many words in the Greek language. Additionally any variations of the characters of a specific string submitted for registration should be reserved only for the same registrant.

Since ICANN's study on Greek characters is not yet complete (in particular regarding the issues that exist between scripts, especially between the Greek, Cyrillic and Latin), the SAP AG is ready to adjust its table, when further information is available.
