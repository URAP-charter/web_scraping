IDN Table for the Czech Language

TLD: .sap

Language Tag: cs

Language Description: Czech

Version: 1.0

Effective Date: 2012-03-30

Registry: SAP AG

The table below lists the characters allowed in the Unicode representation of IDNs associated with the Czech language. The "#" symbol denotes start of a comment that continues to the end of line.

Registrants are advised to carefully consider the potential confusion over the perception of equivalence between an accented Latin character and a sequence of other Latin characters (with or without accents). There exists no equivalence rule that can be applied universally as any such mappings are generally dependent on the language, culture and context in which an IDN is used.

The table presented here is in compliance with the ICANN Guidelines for the Implementation of Internationalized Domain Names Version 3.0 and is intended for publication in the IANA Repository of TLD IDN Practices, for the information of prospective holders of domains in .sap and for the users of resources within those domains. To avoid user confusion due to differing practices across TLD registries, SAP AG is using this IDN table currently in use for the already existing TLD .pl, courtesy of NASK.
