1.  INTRODUCTION

   This document is the DNSSEC Practice Statement (DPS) for Public
   Technical Identifiers (PTI) performing the Root Zone Key Signing Key
   Operator role described within.  It states the practices and
   provisions that PTI employs in providing Root Zone Key Signing and
   Key Distribution services.





                                                                [Page 4]

1.1.  Overview

   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a set of IETF
   specifications for adding origin authentication and data integrity to
   the Domain Name System.  DNSSEC provides a way for software to
   validate that Domain Name System (DNS) data has not been modified
   during Internet transit.  This is done by incorporating public key
   cryptography into the DNS hierarchy to form a chain of trust
   originating at the root zone.

   The DNS was not originally designed with strong security mechanisms
   to provide integrity and authenticity of DNS data.  Over the years, a
   number of vulnerabilities have been discovered that threaten the
   reliability and trustworthiness of the system.  DNSSEC addresses
   these vulnerabilities by adding data origin authentication, data
   integrity verification and authenticated denial of existence
   capabilities to the DNS.

   This DPS is specifically applicable to the Root Zone Key Signing Key
   Operator.  PTI performs this role by virtue of the IANA Naming
   Functions agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
   and Numbers (ICANN).  More generally, this document provides the
   governing practices and provisions related to the management,
   security and technical specifications of DNSSEC operation at the
   Root.  This document will be under the control and management of PTI
   with guidance and direction from ICANN.  Information in this document
   and subsequent documents will be made public as required.

   The DPS is only one of a set of documents relevant to PTI's
   management of the Root Zone's Key Signing Key. Other documents
   supplement the DPS by providing more detailed requirements.  In some
   instances, the DPS refers to these ancillary documents for specific,
   detailed practices implementing certain policies where including the
   specifics are not relevant to the purpose of the DPS.

1.3.1.  Root Zone Manager

   Public Technical Identifiers (PTI) performs the management of the DNS
   Root Zone.  This role includes accepting change requests to the
   contents of the Root Zone from the Top Level Domain (TLD) Operators
   and validating those requests.  After validation occurs,
   implementation is performed by the Root Zone Maintainer.

   PTI is an affiliate of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
   and Numbers (ICANN), and performs these functions under an "IANA
   Naming Functions" contract from ICANN using the facilities, property
   and staff of ICANN under a service agreement.

1.3.2.  Root Zone Maintainer

   Verisign is acting as the Root Zone Maintainer.  They have
   historically performed this role under an agreement with the U.S.
   Government and have entered into an agreement to perform this
   function under contract from ICANN.  The Root Zone Maintainer
   performs the function of receiving validated change requests to the
   Root Zone from the Root Zone Manager, implementing the changes,
   generating a new Root Zone File and distributing it to the Root
   Server Operators.

1.3.3.  Root Server Operators

   The Root Server Operators consist of 12 different professional
   engineering entities responsible for providing the root zone to the
   public via the 13 Root Zone Authoritative Name Servers.

   The Root Server Operators are not involved in the making of any
   policies or modification of data.

1.3.4.  Root Zone Key Signing Key Operator

   PTI performs the Root Zone Key Signing Key (RZ KSK) Operator function
   of generating the RZ KSK and signing the Root Keyset, including the
   Root Zone Zone Signing Key (RZ ZSK), using the KSK.  The RZ KSK
   Operator is also responsible for securely generating and storing the
   private keys and distributing the public portion of the KSK (the
   Trust Anchor) to the relying parties.

   The RZ KSK Operator is responsible for:


   (1)  Generating and protecting the private component of the RZ KSK.





                                                                [Page 6]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   (2)  Securely importing public key components from the RZ ZSK
        Operator.

   (3)  Authenticating and validating the public RZ ZSK keyset.

   (4)  Securely signing the RZ ZSK keyset.

   (5)  Securely transmitting the signed RZ ZSK key set to the RZ ZSK
        Operator.

   (6)  Securely exporting the RZ KSK public key components.

   (7)  Issuing an emergency key roll-over within a reasonable time if
        any private key component associated with the zone is lost or
        suspected to be compromised.

1.3.5.  Root Zone Zone Signing Key Operator

   The RZ ZSK Operator is Verisign performing the function of generating
   the RZ ZSK and signing the Root Zone File using the ZSK.

   The RZ ZSK Operator is also responsible for securely generating and
   storing the private keys and distributing the public portion of the
   ZSK to the RZ KSK Operator for signing.

   The RZ ZSK Operator is responsible for:


   (1)  Generating and protecting the private component of the RZ ZSK.

   (2)  Securely exporting and transmitting the public RZ ZSK component
        to the RZ KSK Operator.

   (3)  Securely importing the signed RZ ZSK keyset from the RZ KSK
        Operator.

   (4)  Signing the Root Zone's resource records (optionally omitting
        the DNSKEY resource record).

   (5)  Issue emergency key roll-over within a reasonable amount of time
        if any private key component associated with the zone is lost or
        suspected to be compromised.

1.3.6.  Child zone manager

   The child zone (TLD) manager is a trustee for the delegated domain,
   and as such responsible for providing registry services and operating

   subordinate DNS servers.  If a child zone is signed using DNSSEC, the
   child zone manager is also responsible for:


   (1)  Generating the keys associated with its zone using a trustworthy
        method.

   (2)  Registering and maintaining the shorthand representations of its
        Key Signing Key (Delegation Signer Resource Record) in the
        parent zone to establish the chain of trust.

   (3)  Taking reasonable precautions to prevent any loss, disclosure or
        unauthorized use of the keys associated with its zone.

   (4)  Issuing emergency key roll-over within reasonable time if any
        private key associated with its zone is lost or suspected to be
        compromised.

1.3.7.  Relying Party

   A Relying Party is the entity that relies on DNSSEC, such as
   security-aware validating resolvers and other applications that
   perform validation of DNSSEC signatures.

   The relying party must properly authenticate, configure and update
   the Trust Anchors as appropriate.  The automated method described in
   RFC 5011 [RFC5011] may be used.

   Relying parties must be informed of any critical changes in the Root
   Zone operation as notified by the RZ KSK Operator in accordance with
   section 2.1.

1.3.8.  Applicability

   This DPS is only applicable to the Root Zone, and more specifically
   the RZ KSK Operator.  Each link in the chain of trust may have
   entirely different requirements that can affect the end entity, and
   is not governed by this DPS.

   Entities must evaluate their own environments and its associated
   threats and vulnerabilities to determine the level of risk they are
   willing to accept.

1.4.  Specification Administration

   This DPS will be periodically reviewed and updated, as appropriate by
   the RZ KSK Operator Policy Management Authority (PMA).  The PMA is
   comprised of representatives of PTI and ICANN and is responsible for



                                                                [Page 8]

2.  PUBLICATION AND REPOSITORIES

2.1.  Repositories

   The RZ KSK Operator publishes the DPS in the repository section of
   the IANA web site at https://www.iana.org/dnssec . Public access to
   this repository will include the option of using an HTTPS-
   authenticated channel.

   Announcements relevant to DNSSEC in the Root Zone will also be posted
   on an announcement-only mailing list.  Subscription and related
   information for the mailing list can be found at
   https://www.iana.org/dnssec .

2.2.  Publication of key signing keys

   The public portion of the Root Zone Key Signing Key will be posted in
   the RZ KSK Operator's repository as a Trust Anchor along with
   mechanisms to validate its integrity.

   Refer to "DNSSEC Trust Anchor Publication for the Root Zone"
   [RFC7958] for details.

2.3.  Access controls on repositories

   Read-only access to the information posted in the repository is
   unrestricted.  The RZ KSK Operator has implemented logical and
   physical security measures to prevent unauthorized persons from
   adding, deleting, or modifying repository entries.

3.  OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

3.1.  Meaning of domain names

   DNSSEC provides mechanisms for ensuring that the origin of the DNS
   data is consistent with the information in the registry.  It does not
   provide any way of determining the legal entity behind the domain
   name, or the relevance of the domain name itself.  Refer to the Root
   Zone Manager function (http://iana.org/domains/root) for details on
   top-level domain name assignments.

3.2.  Activation of DNSSEC for child zone

   The DNSSEC chain of trust from the RZ to a child zone is activated by
   the publishing of a signed Delegation Signer (DS) record for that
   child zone in the root zone.  The DS record is a cryptographic
   shorthand representation, or hash, of the child zone generated and




                                                               [Page 10]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   controlled Key Signing Key. It will establish a chain of trust from
   the Root Zone to the Child Zone.

   The child zone manager must submit the DS record to request
   activation of DNSSEC.  In this DPS, the child zone is equivalent to
   TLD.

3.3.  Identification and authentication of child zone manager

   The identity and authority of the Child Zone Manager will be verified
   using the appropriate method for that specific child zone.

3.4.  Registration of delegation signer (DS) resource records

   The Delegation Signer (DS) resource record provided by the Child Zone
   Manager is vetted and processed by the Root Zone Manager and
   incorporated into a change request.

   The DS resource record must be valid and submitted in the DS RR
   Presentation Format as described in RFC 4034 [RFC4034].  As part of
   the vetting process the DS record is checked against the child zones
   DNSKEY keyset and signatures.  After processing by the Root Zone
   Manager, the DS resource record is incorporated into the Root Zone
   and signed by the Root Zone Maintainer.

3.5.  Method to prove possession of private key

   The Root Zone Manager will take effort to ensure the availability and
   integrity of the child zone by validating the DS resource record to
   the currently published DNSKEY RRSIGs.  If a DS resource record does
   not validate, there will be an out-of-band process in order to
   confirm the authenticity and intention of publishing the DS resource
   record.

3.6.  Removal of DS resource records

3.6.1.  Who can request removal

   The removal of DS resource records (stale or active) can only be
   requested by the Child Zone Manager.

3.6.2.  Procedure for removal request

   Delegation Signer (DS) removal requests is vetted and processed by
   the Root Zone Manager like any other changes to the Root Zone file.

   Upon reception of the request and authentication of the requester,
   the Root Zone Manager will conduct checks to confirm the removal of



                                                               [Page 11]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   the relevant key from the child's zones DNSKEY RRset as part of the
   vetting process.

3.6.3.  Emergency removal request

   If the Child Zone Manager is unable to produce a valid DNSSEC signed
   zone, the manager of that zone may request an emergency removal of
   the DS resource record following the Root Zone Manager's emergency
   change process.

   The emergency change process will be completed within 48 hours from
   the reception of a valid Emergency removal request.

4.  FACILITY, MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL CONTROLS

4.1.  Physical Controls

   The RZ KSK Operator has implemented physical security controls, which
   support the security requirements of this DPS.  Compliance with these
   policies is included in the independent audit requirements described
   in section 7.

4.1.1.  Site location and construction

   The Root Zone Key Signing Key operations are conducted within
   physically protected environments that deter, prevent, and detects
   any unauthorized use of, access to, or disclosure of sensitive
   information and systems, whether covert or overt.  The RZ KSK
   Operator maintains disaster recovery capabilities for its DNSSEC
   operations by maintaining more than one site with comparable physical
   security.

4.1.2.  Physical access

   The RZ KSK Operator's signer systems are protected by a minimum of
   four tiers of physical security, with access to lower tiers required
   before gaining access to higher tiers.  Progressively more
   restrictive physical access controls to each tier are applied.
   Unauthorized access becomes increasingly difficult as one reaches
   higher tiers.

   Sensitive DNSSEC operational activity and any activity related to the
   lifecycle of the RZ KSK occur within these restrictive physical
   tiers.

   Physical access is automatically logged and video recorded.  All
   tiers enforce individual access control through the use of two-factor
   authentication.  Unescorted personnel, including visitors or



                                                               [Page 12]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   employees without specific authorization, are not allowed into such
   secured areas.  The physical security system includes additional
   controls for tiers used for key management activity which serves to
   protect storage of Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and keying
   material.

   Areas used to create and store cryptographic material enforce dual
   access control, each through the use of two-factor authentication.
   HSMs are protected through the use of tamper-evident bags, locked
   safes, cabinets and containers.  Access to HSMs and keying material
   is restricted in accordance with the RZ KSK Operator's segregation of
   duty requirements.  The opening and closing of cabinets or containers
   in these tiers is logged for auditing purposes.

4.1.3.  Power and air conditioning

   The RZ KSK Operator's secure facilities are equipped with primary and
   backup power systems to ensure continuous, uninterrupted access to
   electric power and backup heating/ventilation/air conditioning
   systems to control temperature and relative humidity.

4.1.4.  Water exposures

   The RZ KSK Operator has taken reasonable precautions to minimize the
   impact of water exposure to the signer systems.

4.1.5.  Fire prevention and protection

   The RZ KSK Operator has taken reasonable precautions to prevent and
   extinguish fires or other damaging exposure to flame or smoke.  The
   RZ KSK Operator's fire prevention and protection measures have been
   designed to comply with local fire safety regulations.

4.1.6.  Media storage

   All media containing production software and data, audit, archive, or
   backup information are stored within the RZ KSK Operator's facilities
   or in a secure off-site storage facility with appropriate physical
   and logical access controls designed to limit access to authorized
   personnel and protect such media from accidental damage (e.g., water,
   fire and electromagnetic radiation).

4.1.7.  Waste disposal

   Sensitive documents and materials are shredded before disposal.
   Media used to collect or transmit sensitive information are rendered
   unreadable before disposal.  Cryptographic devices are physically
   destroyed or zeroized in accordance with the manufacturers' guidance



                                                               [Page 13]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   prior to disposal.  Other waste is disposed of in accordance with the
   RZ KSK Operator's normal waste disposal requirements.

4.1.8.  Off-site backup

   The RZ KSK Operator performs routine backups of critical system data,
   audit log data, and other sensitive information.  Off-site backup
   media are stored in a physically secure manner using a bonded third
   party storage facility.

4.2.  Procedural Controls

4.2.1.  Trusted roles

   The RZ KSK Operator considers the categories of personnel identified
   in this section as Trusted Persons having a Trusted Role.  A Trusted
   Person may only possess one Trusted Role.  Persons seeking to become
   Trusted Persons by obtaining a Trusted Role must successfully
   complete the screening requirements set out in this DPS.

   Trusted Persons include all employees, contractors, and consultants
   of either PTI or ICANN that have access to or control operations that
   may materially affect:


   o  Generation and protection of the private component of the Root
      Zone Key Signing Key.

   o  Secure export or import of any public components.

   o  Zone File data.

   Trusted roles include, but are not limited to:


   o  Designated system administration personnel

   o  Crypto officers

   o  Recovery key share holders

   o  Safe security controllers

   o  Internal witnesses

   o  The ceremony administrators





                                                               [Page 14]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


4.2.2.  Number of persons required per task

   The RZ KSK Operator has established, maintains, and enforces rigorous
   control procedures to ensure the segregation of duties based on roles
   and to ensure that multiple Trusted Persons are required to perform
   sensitive tasks.

   The most sensitive tasks, such as access to and management of
   cryptographic key material, are enforced by rigorous control
   procedures to ensure the segregation of duties based on roles.  These
   procedures also ensure that multiple Trusted Persons are required to
   perform any sensitive tasks.

   Access to and management of cryptographic hardware is based on the
   principle of successive barriers in three tiers, requiring at least
   seven trusted persons from four different roles.  These barriers are
   as follows:

   Tier 5:
         Physical access to safe room requires one out of four persons
         from the Key Ceremony Administrator role in combination with
         one out of four persons from the Internal Witness roles.

   Tier 6:
         Physical access to cryptographic hardware (HSM) and activation
         material requires one out of two of the Safe Controller #1s,
         and one out of the two Safe Controller #2s in addition to the
         Trusted Persons required at Tier 5 and 7.

   Tier 7:
         Activation of HSM requires three out of seven Crypto Officers
         to extract activation material from above safe deposit boxes
         using their physical key.  Safe deposit box operation that
         involves opening of any one of the deposit box requires three
         out of seven Crypto Officers to be present.

   Restoration of the contents of a HSM requires at least six trusted
   persons from two different roles, as follows:

   Secret share:
         Reconstruction of the secret key used for encryption of the
         application keys requires five out of seven Recovery Key Share
         Holders.

   Encrypted application keys:
         Physical access to the encrypted application keys requires one
         out of four Ceremony Administrators.




                                                               [Page 15]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   These combinations of people are designed so that the binomial
   probability to find a group collaborating in any of these
   constellations is less than one in a million, assuming a dishonesty
   rate of 5% among Trusted Persons

   Other internal control procedures are designed to ensure that at a
   minimum of two Trusted Persons are required to perform any sensitive
   task.

4.2.3.  Identification and authentication for each role

   For all personnel seeking to become Trusted Persons, verification of
   identity is performed through the personal (physical) presence of
   such personnel before Trusted Persons performing security functions
   and a check of well-recognized forms of identification (e.g.,
   passports and driver's licenses).  Identity is further confirmed
   through the background checking procedures described in section 4.3
   of this DPS.  The RZ KSK Operator ensures that personnel have
   achieved Trusted Status and approval has been given before these
   personnel are:


   o  issued access devices and granted access to the required
      facilities,

   o  issued electronic credentials to access and perform specific
      functions on the RZ KSK Operator's IT systems.

4.2.4.  Tasks requiring separation of duties

   Tasks requiring separation of duties include (but are not limited to)
   the generation, use and destruction of Root Zone DNSSEC key material.

   Personnel holding a role in the multi-party access to the RZ KSK do
   not hold a role in the multi-party access to the RZ ZSK, or vice
   versa.  Audit personnel also may not participate in the multi-person
   control for the RZ KSK or RZ ZSK.

4.3.  Personnel Controls

4.3.1.  Qualifications, experience, and clearance requirements

   The RZ KSK Operator requires that personnel seeking to become Trusted
   Persons present proof of the requisite background, qualifications,
   and experience needed to perform their prospective job
   responsibilities competently and satisfactorily.





                                                               [Page 16]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   Background checks are repeated at least every 5 years for personnel
   holding Trusted Roles.

4.3.2.  Background check procedures

   All personnel with access to any cryptographic components used with
   the Root Zone Signing process are required to pass a background check
   extending back at least three years.

   Prior to commencement of engagement in a Trusted Role, the RZ KSK
   Operator conducts background checks that include the following:


   o  Confirmation of previous employment

   o  Check of professional references

   o  Confirmation of the highest or most relevant educational degree
      obtained

   o  Check of credit/financial records to the extent allowed by
      national laws for the individual's country of residence

   The factors revealed in a background check that may be considered
   grounds for rejecting candidates for Trusted Roles, or for taking
   action against an existing Trusted Person generally include, but are
   not limited to:


   o  Misrepresentations made by the candidate or Trusted Person

   o  Highly unfavorable or unreliable professional references

   o  Indications of a lack of financial responsibility

   Reports containing such information are evaluated by human resources
   and security personnel, who determine the appropriate course of
   action in light of the type, magnitude, and frequency of the behavior
   uncovered by the background check.

   Such actions may include measures up to and including the
   cancellation of offers of employment made to candidates for Trusted
   Roles or the termination of existing Trusted Persons.  The use of
   information revealed in a background check to take such actions is
   subject to the applicable federal, state, and local laws.






                                                               [Page 17]

   The RZ KSK Operator provides refresher training and updates to their
   personnel to the extent and frequency required to ensure that such
   personnel maintain the required level of proficiency to perform their
   job responsibilities competently and satisfactorily.

4.3.5.  Job rotation frequency and sequence

   The responsibility to execute the tasks of respective Trusted Roles
   will be distributed evenly over the set of the appointed personnel.

   Recovery Key Share Holders and Crypto Officers will be serving
   limited terms.  Refer to Trusted Community Representatives - Proposed
   Approach to Root Key Management [TCRS] for the original proposal for
   TCR participation.

   Other positions are rotated and replaced as needed.








                                                               [Page 18]

4.3.6.  Sanctions for unauthorized actions

   Appropriate disciplinary actions are taken for unauthorized actions
   with respect to this DPS and/or other violations of the RZ KSK
   Operator's security policies and procedures.  Disciplinary actions
   may include measures up to and including termination and are
   commensurate with the frequency and severity of the unauthorized
   actions.

4.3.7.  Contracting personnel requirements

   In limited circumstances, independent contractors or consultants may
   be used to fill Trusted Roles.  Any such contractor or consultant is
   held to the same functional and security criteria that apply to any
   PTI and ICANN employees in a comparable role.  Independent
   contractors and consultants who have not completed or passed the
   background check procedures specified in DPS section 4.3 are
   permitted access to the RZ KSK Operator's secure facilities only to
   the extent they are escorted and directly supervised by Trusted
   Persons at all times.

4.3.8.  Documentation supplied to personnel

   PTI and ICANN provide their employees the requisite training and
   other documentation needed to perform their job responsibilities
   competently and satisfactorily.

4.4.  Audit Logging Procedures

4.4.1.  Types of events recorded

   Specific auditing events related to KSK key life cycle management
   events, including:

4.4.2.  Frequency of processing log

   Audit logs are examined after each key ceremony for significant
   security and operational events.  In addition, the RZ KSK Operator
   reviews its audit logs for suspicious or unusual activity in response
   to alerts generated based on irregularities and incidents within the
   DNSSEC related systems.  Audit log processing consists of a review of
   the audit logs and documentation for all significant events in an
   audit log summary.  Audit log reviews include a verification that the
   log has not been tampered with and an investigation of any alerts or
   irregularities in the logs.  Actions taken based on audit log reviews
   are also documented.





                                                               [Page 20]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


4.4.3.  Retention period for audit log information

   All audit data collected in terms of section 4.4.1 is retained on-
   site for at least one year after creation and then archived for at
   least 10 years.

   The media holding the audit data and the applications required to
   process the information are maintained to ensure that the archived
   data can be accessed for the time period set forth in this DPS.

4.4.4.  Protection of audit log

   Audit logs are kept off-line and protected with an audit log handling
   procedure that includes mechanisms to protect the log files from
   unauthorized viewing, modification, deletion, or other tampering.

   Only authorized Trusted Persons are able to obtain direct access to
   the audit information.

4.4.5.  Audit log backup procedures

   The RZ KSK Operator backs up electronic archives of its audit
   information in an off-site secure facility after each key ceremony.
   Copies of paper-based records are also stored off-site and are
   maintained in the same manner.

4.4.6.  Audit collection system

   Automated audit data is generated and recorded at the application and
   operating system level.  Manually generated audit data is recorded by
   the Ceremony Administrator on paper.

   After each completed Key Ceremony, the audit log information is
   collected by the Ceremony Administrator at the generating host and
   copied onto at least two portable media.  Electronic copies of paper-
   based documents are also made.

   The Ceremony Administrator is responsible for storing one copy of the
   audit log information at the off-site secure facility, and one copy
   with the signer system.

4.4.7.  Notification to event-causing subject

   No notice is required to be given to the individual, organization,
   device, or application causing a log event.






                                                               [Page 21]

4.4.8.  Vulnerability assessments

   Events in the audit process are logged, in part, to monitor system
   vulnerabilities.  Vulnerability assessments are performed manually as
   part of the audit log review process after each key ceremony.

   The RZ KSK Operator also maintains contacts with relevant parties
   within the community to share the latest security-related information
   which may affect the signed root zone.  Continuous vulnerability
   assessments are made based on this information.

4.5.  Compromise and Disaster Recovery

4.5.1.  Incident and compromise handling procedures

   If the RZ KSK Operator detects an event that has lead to, or could
   have lead to a security compromise of any of the security mechanisms,
   it will perform an investigation in order to determine the nature of
   the incident.  If the incident is suspected to have compromised the
   private component of an active KSK, the Emergency KSK roll-over
   procedure will be enacted as described in section 4.5.3.

   Otherwise, the scope, severity and damage of the incident will be
   assessed and a plan to remedy the effect will be developed and
   implemented.  The plan will also include measures to prevent the
   event from reoccurring.

   The incident handling procedures include reporting of all events to
   RZ KSK Operations Security (RKOS), which in turn reports to the RZ
   KSK Policy Management Authority (PMA).

4.5.2.  Corrupted computing resources, software, and/or data

   In the event of the corruption of computing resources, software, and/
   or data, this occurrence will be reported to RKOS and will cause the
   RZ KSK Operator's incident handling procedures to be enacted.  Such
   procedures require appropriate escalation, incident investigation,
   and incident response.  If necessary, the RZ KSK Operator's key
   compromise or disaster recovery procedures will be enacted as
   described in section 4.5.4 and 4.5.3.

4.5.3.  Entity private key compromise procedures

4.5.3.1.  Key Signing Key compromise

   The RZ KSK Operator has established and maintains Emergency KSK roll-
   over procedures to ensure readiness for key compromise situations.




                                                               [Page 22]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   Upon the suspected or known compromise of a Root Zone Key Signing
   Key, RKOS will assess the situation, develop an appropriate action
   plan, and implement the action plan with approval from the PMA and
   PTI executive management.

   As part of the KSK emergency roll-over procedures, the RZ KSK
   Operator maintains the capability of being able to generate and
   publish an interim Trust Anchor within 48 hours.  In favorable
   circumstances, this interim Trust Anchor may be used to facilitate an
   orderly RFC 5011 [RFC5011] automatic KSK roll-over to a new and
   sanctioned Trust Anchor generated at a new scheduled key ceremony,
   held within reasonable time.

   The RZ KSK Operator will inform the community of any emergency as
   soon as possible using the channels stipulated in section 2.1.

4.5.3.2.  Key Signing Key loss

   If the private component of a Trust Anchor is permanently lost, the
   latest point in time where this loss is detected, will inevitably be
   at the key ceremony when it is supposed to be used.  At this point in
   time, the Root Zone Maintainer/ZSK Operator has signatures for at
   least 33 days (see 6.6) of independent operations.

   If possible, a new KSK will be generated at this key ceremony or
   another ceremony scheduled within 48 hours.  If the RZ KSK Operator
   is unable to accommodate the key ceremony, an interim KSK must be
   generated by the RZ KSK Operator and published as a Trust Anchor
   within the stipulated 48 hours.

   The community is then given a minimum of 30 days notice to add the
   new Trust Anchors to the validating resolvers before the DNSKEY RRset
   has to be re-signed with the new Trust Anchor.  Failure to update a
   validating resolver will render that resolver inoperable.

   The RZ KSK Operator will inform the community of any emergency as
   soon as possible using the channels stipulated in section 2.1.

   The old Trust Anchor will remain untouched in the key set for one 10
   days time slot (see section Section 6.6).  In the next consecutive
   time slot, the old Trust Anchor will be marked as revoked, and after
   this time slot the lost key is permanently removed.

4.5.3.3.  Zone Signing Key Compromise

   The RZ KSK Operator will support Root Zone Zone Signing Key emergency
   rollover in the case of RZ ZSK compromise while following the RZ ZSK




                                                               [Page 23]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   Operator's procedural directions.  Refer to the RZ ZSK Operator's DPS
   for details.

4.5.4.  Business Continuity and IT Disaster Recovery Capabilities

   The RZ KSK Operator has implemented at least two fully-functional,
   geographically and logically dispersed sites, which at any point in
   time hold the data required for production, and are evenly utilized.
   All sites implements the same physical security protections and
   operational controls as specified in 4.1.2.

   The RZ KSK Operator has developed, implemented and tested a business
   continuity and IT disaster recovery plan to mitigate the effects of
   natural, man-made, or technological disasters or other disasters that
   requires temporary or permanent cessation of operations from any of
   the RZ KSK Operator's facilities.  The business continuity and IT
   disaster recovery plans are in place to address the restoration of
   information systems services and key business functions.  These plans
   address:


   o  Roles and responsibilities in the event of a disaster.

   o  Fallback procedures for restoring business-critical processes
      within acceptable times.

   o  Resumption procedures for restoring normal operations.

   o  The criteria for activating the plan.

   The RZ KSK Operator maintains the capability to restore or recover
   essential operations within 48 hours following a disaster with
   support for at minimum the following functions:


   o  Communication with the public.

   o  Ability to import KSRs (Key Signing Requests) and export SKRs
      (Signed Key Responses).

   o  Generation of Key Signing Keys.

   o  Processing and signing of KSR contents.

   o  Publishing the Trust Anchor.

   The RZ KSK Operator maintains redundant hardware and backups of its
   infrastructure system software at all sites.  In addition, private



                                                               [Page 24]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   keys are backed up and maintained in accordance with DPS section
   5.2.4, and in such a way that critical keying material is distributed
   to all sites before put into production.

   The RZ KSK Operator's business continuity and IT disaster recovery
   plans have been designed to provide full recovery within one week at
   the alternative site following any incident or disaster occurring at
   any of the RZ KSK Operator's sites.

   When possible, operational status is restored as soon as possible
   following any incident or disaster.

   These plans are regularly tested, validated, and updated to be
   operational in the event of any incident or disaster.  Results of
   such tests are reviewed and kept for audit and planning purposes.

4.6.  Entity termination

   The RZ KSK Operator has implemented a DNSSEC termination plan in the
   event that the roles and responsibilities of the Root Zone KSK
   Operator must transition to other entities.  The Root Zone Manager
   will co-ordinate with the Root Zone ZSK Operator in order to execute
   the transition in a secure and transparent manner.

   The DNSSEC termination plan also includes procedures in the event of
   the termination of the Root Zone Maintainer and/or Root Zone ZSK
   Operator.

5.  TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS

5.1.  Key Pair Generation and Installation

5.1.1.  Key pair generation

   Root Zone (RZ) Key Signing Key (KSK) key pair generation is performed
   by multiple pre-selected, trained and trusted individuals using
   Trustworthy Systems and processes that provide for the security and
   required cryptographic strength for the generated keys.

   All KSK key pairs are generated in pre-planned Key Generation
   Ceremonies in accordance with the requirements of the Key Ceremony
   Reference Guide.  The activities performed in each key generation
   ceremony are recorded, dated and signed by the Ceremony
   Administrator.  These records are kept for audit and tracking
   purposes as required in section 4.4.3.






                                                               [Page 25]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


5.1.2.  Public key delivery

   The public component of a Trust Anchor will be distributed in a
   secure fashion to preclude substitution attacks.

   Acceptable methods for delivery and validation of Trust Anchors
   include, but are not limited to:


   o  In-band as zone data in DNSKEY RRset, with proof traceable to the
      previous Trust Anchor as described in RFC 5011 [RFC5011].

   o  Publication of the Trust Anchor in the repository, protected and
      authenticated via TLS/SSL, while also providing S/MIME [RFC5751]
      and other signatures traceable to the RZ KSK Operator and
      optionally other parties.

   o  Proof distributed out-of-band directly to the witnesses
      participating at the key ceremony, whereas distribution to their
      respective communities is at the witness' own discretions.

5.1.3.  Public key parameters generation and quality checking

   For the current key size, primality testing of RSA parameters (p and
   q) will be performed to ensure with a probability less than 2^-100
   that the numbers are not composite.

   Quality checking will also include validating the size of the public
   exponent to be both resource efficient and secure.

5.1.4.  Key usage purposes

   Any root zone KSK private key will only be used for signing the root
   zone's DNSKEY RRset or self-signing using the same padding scheme in
   order to prove possession of the private key.

   Any RRSIG record generated as a result of a KSK signing operation
   will not have a validity period longer than 21 days, and will never
   expire more than 180 days in the future.

5.2.  Private key protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering
      Controls

   All cryptographic functions involving the private component of the
   KSK are performed within the HSM; that is, the private component will
   not be exported from the HSM except in encrypted form for purposes of
   key backup.




                                                               [Page 26]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


5.2.1.  Cryptographic module standards and controls

   For RZ KSK generation and RZ KSK private component operations and
   storage, the RZ KSK Operator uses hardware security modules that are
   validated at FIPS 140-2 level 4 overall.

5.2.2.  Private key (m-of-n) multi-person control

   The RZ KSK Operator has implemented technical and procedural
   mechanisms that require the participation of multiple trusted
   individuals to perform sensitive cryptographic operations.  The RZ
   KSK Operator splits activation data needed to make use of the RZ KSK
   private key onto separate smartcards controlled by trusted
   individuals (crypto officers) selected from members of the Internet
   community not already part of root zone management operations.
   Specifically, organizationally separate parties, not affiliated with
   PTI, ICANN or Verisign.

   A threshold number of smartcards (m) out of the total number of
   smartcards created and distributed for a particular hardware security
   module (n) is required to activate a RZ KSK private key stored on the
   module.  The threshold number of cards needed to sign using the RZ
   KSK is three out of seven.  The smartcards are protected in
   accordance with Section 5.4.2.

5.2.3.  Private key escrow

   Private components of Root Zone Key Signing Keys are not escrowed.

5.2.4.  Private key backup

   Encrypted copies of the RZ KSK private key(s) are backed up onto
   portable media held by the RZ KSK Operator and sent by courier to the
   other facilities.  The key used to encrypt the private key(s) is
   backed up using a five out of seven threshold scheme with smartcards
   distributed to trusted individuals (recovery key share-holders)
   selected from members of the Internet community not already part of
   root zone management operations (specifically, organizationally
   separate parties, not affiliated with PTI, ICANN or Verisign).  The
   recovery key share holders keep the cards in tamper-evident bags,
   stored in geographically dispersed locations under their control.

5.2.5.  Private key storage on cryptographic module

   Private keys held on hardware cryptographic modules are stored in
   encrypted form.





                                                               [Page 27]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


5.2.6.  Private key archival

   The private half of the RZ KSK key pair is not archived after
   rollover.  This eliminates the possibility of its misuse in RZ KSK
   rollover or revocation after its suppression.

5.2.7.  Private key transfer into or from a cryptographic module

   The RZ KSK Operator generates RZ KSK key pairs on the hardware
   security modules in which the keys will be used.  In addition, the RZ
   KSK Operator makes copies of these key pairs for routine recovery and
   disaster recovery purposes.  When key pairs are backed up to another
   hardware security module, these key pairs are transported between
   modules in encrypted form.

5.2.8.  Method of activating private key

   The RZ KSK private key will be activated using three out of seven
   crypto officer controlled smartcards that must be inserted into the
   HSM, one at a time, while entering the crypto officers' PIN.

5.2.9.  Method of deactivating private key

   The RZ KSK private key may be deactivated by three out of seven
   crypto officer controlled smartcards being inserted into the HSM, one
   at a time, while entering the crypto officers' common PIN.  The cards
   that were not used to activate the RZ KSK private key in the ceremony
   will be preferentially used for deactivation.

   Alternatively, the RZ KSK private keys may be deactivated upon system
   shutdown.

5.2.10.  Method of destroying private key

   When required, the RZ KSK Operator destroys RZ KSK private keys in a
   manner that reasonably ensures that there are no residual remains of
   the keys that could lead to the reconstruction of the keys.  The RZ
   KSK Operator utilizes the zeroization function of its hardware
   security modules and other appropriate means to ensure the complete
   destruction of RZ KSK private keys.  When performed, private key
   destruction activities are logged as part of a key ceremony.

5.3.  Other Aspects of Key Pair Management








                                                               [Page 28]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


5.3.1.  Public key archival

   RZ KSK public keys are backed up and archived.

5.3.2.  Key usage periods

   The Operational Period of a RZ KSK ends upon its supersession.  The
   superseded RZ KSK will never be reused to sign a resource record
   while in retention.

5.4.  Activation data

5.4.1.  Activation data generation and installation

   Activation data used to protect access to hardware security modules
   (HSM) containing RZ KSK private keys is generated in accordance with
   the requirements of DPS section 5.1 and the Key Ceremony Reference
   Guide.  The creation and distribution of these smartcards and/or
   access to them is logged.

5.4.2.  Activation data protection

   Crypto Officers are required to safeguard the credentials needed to
   access activation data.

   When required, activation data will be decommissioned using methods
   that protect against the loss, theft, modification, unauthorized
   disclosure, or unauthorized use of the private keys protected by this
   activation data.

5.4.3.  Other aspects of activation data

   Each crypto officer holds a physical key to one safe deposit box
   located inside a safe in the the RZ KSK Operator's safe room.  This
   safe deposit box contains the crypto officer's card stored in a
   tamper-evident bag with an individual ID.  It is the crypto officer's
   responsibility to safeguard and store his or her physical key between
   key ceremonies.

5.5.  Computer Security Controls

   The RZ KSK Operator ensures that the systems maintaining key software
   and data files are Trustworthy Systems secure from unauthorized
   access.  In addition, the RZ KSK Operator limits access to production
   servers to those individuals with a valid business reason for such
   access.  General application users do not have accounts on production
   servers.




                                                               [Page 29]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


5.6.  Network Security Controls

   No part of the signer system making use of the HSM is connected to
   any communications network.  Communication of ZSK key signing
   requests (KSR) from the Root Zone Maintainer/ZSK Operator is done
   using a TLS client-side authenticated web server connected to the RZ
   KSK Operator's production network.  Transfer of a KSR from the web
   server to the signer system is performed manually using removable
   media (refer to Section 6.7 for further details on verification of
   the KSR).

   The RZ KSK Operator's production network is logically separated from
   other components.  This separation prevents network access except
   through defined application processes.  The RZ KSK Operator uses
   firewalls to protect the production network from internal and
   external intrusion and limit the nature and source of network
   activities that may access production systems that are related to key
   signing activities.

5.7.  Timestamping

   Time will be derived through a manual procedure before each key
   ceremony.  The ceremony administrator will manually set the signer
   system clock and the wall clock to current UTC time drawn from a
   reliable time source.

   Time derived from the procedure will be used for timestamping of


   o  electronic and paper based audit log records

   o  DNSSEC signatures expiration- and inception times

   Asserted times are required to be accurate within three minutes.

5.8.  Life Cycle Technical Controls

5.8.1.  System development controls

   The RZ KSK Operator's Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC)
   procedures for the Root Zone KSK key generation and signer software
   implements relevant parts of NIST SP 800-64 for incorporating
   security and trustworthiness into the SDLC.

   In addition, all critical parts of the signers modules developed by
   the RZ KSK Operator will be subject to external code review.  The
   code review is required to certify that:




                                                               [Page 30]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   o  There is a documented architectural design describing the security
      domains and functions maintained by the signer.

   o  The architectural design demonstrates that the signer system
      prevents bypass of the security-enforcing functionality.

   o  There is a functional specification completely representing the
      signer system and all operations associated with it.

   o  There is a modular design description and a one-to-one
      correspondence with the modular decomposition of the
      implementation.

   o  The implementation representation completely and accurately
      implements the security-enforcing functions.

   The RZ KSK Operator developed software, when first loaded, provides a
   method to verify that the software on the system originated from the
   RZ KSK Operator, has not been modified prior to installation, and is
   the version intended for use.

5.8.2.  Security management controls

   The RZ KSK Operator has mechanisms in place to control and monitor
   the configuration of its systems.  The RZ KSK Operator creates a hash
   of all software packages and software updates.  This hash is used to
   verify the integrity of such software manually.  Upon installation
   and periodically thereafter, the RZ KSK Operator validates the
   integrity of its systems.

5.8.3.  Life cycle security controls

   The signer system is designed to require a minimum of maintenance.
   Updates critical to the security and operations of the signer system
   will be applied after formal testing and approval.  The origin of all
   software and firmware will be securely authenticated by available
   means.

   Critical hardware components of the signer system will be procured
   directly from the manufacturer and transported in tamper-evident bags
   to their destination in the secure facility.  Any hardware will be
   decommissioned well before the specified life expectancy.

6.  ZONE SIGNING

   The RZ KSK Operator provides the the RZ ZSK Operator with signed and
   valid DNSSEC RRset for the RZ KSK Operator's current keys and the
   KSKs.



                                                               [Page 31]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   The Root Zone Maintainer includes this keyset into the Root Zone
   file, adds the Next Secure resource records (NSEC), and creates
   signatures for all relevant records.  The Root Zone is then
   distributed to the Root Server Operators.

   The daily Root Zone signing will be conducted semi-automatically by
   the Root Zone Maintainer's system.

6.1.  Key lengths and algorithms

   Key pairs are required to be of sufficient length to prevent others
   from determining the key pair's private key using crypto-analysis
   during the period of expected utilization of such key pairs.

   The current RZ KSK key pair(s) is an RSA key pair, with a modulus
   size of 2048 bits.

6.2.  Authenticated denial of existence

   Authenticated denial of existence will be provided through the use of
   NSEC resource records as specified in RFC 4034 [RFC4034].

6.3.  Signature format

   The cryptographic hash function used in conjunction with the signing
   algorithm is required to be sufficiently resistant to preimage
   attacks during the time in which the signature is valid.

   The RZ KSK signatures will be generated by encrypting SHA-256 hashes
   using RSA [RFC5702].

6.4.  Zone signing key roll-over

   ZSK rollover is carried out quarterly automatically by the Root Zone
   ZSK Operator's system as described in the Root Zone ZSK Operator's
   DPS.

6.5.  Key signing key roll-over

   Each RZ KSK will be scheduled to be rolled over through a key
   ceremony as required, or after 5 years of operation.

   RZ KSK roll-over is scheduled to facilitate automatic updates of
   resolvers' Trust Anchors as described in RFC 5011 [RFC5011].

   After a RZ KSK has been removed from the key set, it will be retained
   after its operational period until the next scheduled key ceremony,




                                                               [Page 32]

                       Root Zone KSK Operator DPS           October 2016


   when the private component will be destroyed in accordance with
   section 5.2.10.

6.6.  Signature life-time and re-signing frequency

   The signing practice of the Root Zone is divided into quarterly
   continuous time cycles of approximately 90 days.  Time cycles begin
   on the following dates each year:


      January 1st

      April 1st

      July 1st

      October 1st

   For each of these time cycles there is a key ceremony scheduled
   approximately 60 days but no later than 33 days, before the time
   cycle commences.  At this key ceremony, all of the necessary RZ KSK
   operations are performed to enable the Root Zone Maintainer to
   operate and publish the zone independently throughout the period.

   To facilitate automatic updates of resolvers' Trust Anchors as
   described in RFC 5011 [RFC5011] while minimizing the number of keys
   in the key set, each of the ~90 day time cycles is divided into 10
   day slots (9 slots).

   The time cycle will never last less than 90 days.  If the time cycle
   is more than 90 days, the last slot in the cycle will be expanded to
   fill the period.

   For each of these slots there is a pre-generated DNSKEY key set that
   is signed at the key ceremony with 21 days validity time to allow for
   signature overlap.  The Root Zone Maintainer is responsible for
   selecting the current key set and publishing it with the
   corresponding valid signature.

         KSK(n+1)

   At each publication, the Root Zone Maintainer selects and includes
   the current key set and corresponding signature(s), and then signs
   all other authoritative records within the root zone using the
   current RZ ZSK.

6.7.  Verification of zone signing key set

   Each key set within the Key Signing Request (KSR) is self-signed with
   the active key to provide proof of possession of the corresponding
   private key.  The signer system will automatically validate this
   signature and perform checking of available parameters before
   accepting the KSR for signing.

   The RZ KSK Operator will verify the authenticity of the KSR document
   by performing an out-of-band verification (verbally over the phone,
   by fax, or any other available method) of the hash of the KSR, before
   entering the KSR into the signer system.  The resulting Signed Key
   Response (SKR) is transferred back using the same TLS client-side
   authenticated connection used to receive the KSR from the Root Zone
   Maintainer.

6.8.  Verification of resource records

   Signature verification will be performed on the signer system that
   holds both the signed and the unsigned keyset prior to the
   compilation of the SKR.  Integrity of the signatures in the SKR is
   verified by the RZ ZSK Operator using the published RZ TA.

7.  COMPLIANCE AUDIT

   An annual Service Organization Control 3 (SOC 3) audit for DNSSEC
   operations examination is performed for the Root Zone Key Signing Key
   operations performed by the RZ KSK Operator.

7.1.  Frequency of entity compliance audit

   Compliance Audits are conducted at least annually at the sole expense
   of the audited entity.

7.2.  Identity/qualifications of auditor

   The RZ KSK Operator's compliance audits are performed by a public
   accounting firm that demonstrates proficiency in:


   o  DNSSEC public key infrastructure technology

   o  information security tools and techniques

   o  security auditing

   o  the third-party attestation function

   and is accredited by the American Institute of Certified Public
   Accountants (AICPA), which requires the possession of certain skill
   sets, quality assurance measures such as peer review, competency
   testing, standards with respect to proper assignment of staff to
   engagements, and requirements for continuing professional education.

7.3.  Auditor's relationship to audited party

   Compliance audits of the RZ KSK Operators's operations are performed
   by a public accounting firm that is independent of PTI, ICANN,
   Verisign and the auditor of Verisign.  Third party auditors do not
   participate in the multi-person control for the RZ KSK.





                                                               [Page 36]

7.4.  Topics covered by audit

   The scope of the RZ KSK Operator's annual Compliance Audit includes
   all DNSSEC related procedures such as key environmental controls, key
   management operations, infrastructure/administrative controls, RZ KSK
   and signature life cycle management and practices disclosures.

7.5.  Actions taken as a result of deficiency

   With respect to compliance audits of the RZ KSK Operator's
   operations, significant exceptions or deficiencies identified during
   the Compliance Audit will result in a determination of actions to be
   taken.  Such determinations are made by the RZ KSK Operator's
   management with input from the auditor.  The RZ KSK Operator's
   management is responsible for developing and implementing a
   corrective action plan.  If the RZ KSK Operator determines that such
   exceptions or deficiencies pose an immediate threat to the security
   or integrity of the RZ KSK, a corrective action plan will be
   developed within 30 days and implemented within a commercially
   reasonable period of time.  For less serious exceptions or
   deficiencies, the RZ KSK Operator's Management will evaluate the
   significance of such issues and determine the appropriate course of
   action.

7.6.  Communication of results
