			IANA Report on the Redelegation of the .CV Top-Level Domain
		</h1>
		
		<p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is tasked with 
		managing the Domain Name System root zone as part of a set of functions governed by a 
		contract with the U.S. Government. This includes the delegation and redelegation of top- 
		level domains.</p>
		
		<p>A subset of top-level domains are designated for the local Internet communities in 
		countries to operate in a way that best suits their local needs. These are known as 
		country-code top-level domains, and are assigned by ICANN to responsible trustees 
		(known as ‘Sponsoring Organisations’) who meet a number of public-interest criteria for 
		eligibility — largely relating to their level of support from their local Internet community, 
		their capacity to ensure stable operation of the domain, and their applicability under any 
		relevant local laws.</p>

		<p>Through an ICANN department known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
		(IANA), requests are received for delegating and redelegating the sponsoring 
		organisation of top-level domains. An investigation is performed on the circumstances 
		pertinent to those requests, and, when appropriate, the requests are implemented. 
		Decisions on whether to implement requests to delegate or redelegate top-level domains 
		are made by the ICANN Board of Directors, taking into account ICANN’s core mission 
		of ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems.</p>
		
		<p>In accordance with this, a request was received for the redelegation of the .CV top-level 
		domain on 14 April 2009. This domain is designated in the ISO 3166-1 standard for Cape 
		Verde, a country located in the Atlantic Ocean near the west coast of Africa with a 
		population of approximately half a million people.</p>
		
		<p>The .CV top-level domain was initially delegated in 1996 to the Instituto Superior de 
		Engenharia e Ciencias do Mar (ISECMAR), with registry technical operations performed 
		by Fundação para a Computação Científica Nacional (FCCN) — the Portuguese non- 
		profit academic networking organisation that operates .PT.</p>

		<p>The proposed redelegation appeals for Agência Nacional das Comunicações (ANAC) to 
		be designated as the Sponsoring Organisation for the .CV top-level domain. The proposed 
		administrative contact is Suzete Júlia Dias Monteiro Centeio of ANAC. The proposed 
		technical contact is Assis Neves Guerreiro of FCCN.</p>
		
		<p>The redelegation is sought to implement Ministerial Decree 31/2006, which calls for all 
		electronic communications management to be brought under the single government 
		regulator ANAC, including specifically the “planning and management of the top-level 
		domain suffix ‘cv’”.</p>
		
	<h2>Evaluation Procedure</h2>
		<p>The evaluation of a delegation or redelegation request is guided by the practices summarised in:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<a href="/go/rfc1591">“Domain Name System Structure and Delegation”</a> (RFC 1591). This document describes IANA function practices relating to delegations at its publication in 1994.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<a href="/go/icp-1">“Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation”</a> (ICP-1). This document represents an update of the portions of RFC 1591 dealing with ccTLDs and reflects subsequent evolution of the policies followed by ICANN through May 1999.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee’s Principles for Delegation and Administration of ccTLDs (GAC Principles). This document serve as “best practices” to guide governments in assuming proper roles with respect to the Internet's naming system.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
<p>In considering the delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, input is sought regarding the proposed new sponsoring organisation, as well as from persons and organisations that may be significantly affected by the change, particularly those within the nation or territory to which the ccTLD is designated. As noted in ICP-1, the parties affected include the relevant government or public authority: “The desires of the government of a country with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.”</p>
<p>Taking these factors into consideration, the burden required to permit a delegation action involves determining suitability in relation to the proposed sponsoring organisation’s capacity to meet the following criteria:</p>
<!--boilerplate-redelegation-criteria-html-2009v1-->
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Operational and technical skills</b>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>The prospective sponsoring organisation has the requisite skills to operate the TLD appropriately. (ICP-1 §a, RFC 1591 §3.5)
					</li>
					<li>There must be reliable, full-time IP connectivity to the nameservers and electronic mail connectivity to the operators; (ICP-1 §a; RFC 1591 §3.1)
					</li>
					<li>The manager must perform its duties in assigning domains and operating nameservers with technical competence (ICP-1 §d; RFC 1591 §3.5)
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Operator in country</b>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>The prospective manager supervises and operates the domain name from within the country represented by the TLD; (ICP-1 §a; RFC 1591 §3.1)
					</li>
					<li>The prospective administrative contact must reside in the country represented by the TLD. (ICP-1 §a; RFC 1591 §3.1)
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Equitable treatment</b>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>The prospective manager must be equitable and fair to all groups encompassed by the TLD that may request domain names (ICP-1 §c; RFC 1591 §3.3)
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Community/Governmental support</b>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>The prospective manager has the requisite authority to operate the TLD appropriately, with the desire of the government taken very seriously. (ICP-1 §a, GAC Principles)
					</li>
					<li>Significantly interested parties in the domain should agree that the prospective manager is the appropriate party to receive the delegation (ICP-1 §a; RFC 1591 §3.4)
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In meeting these criteria, information is requested from regarding the proposed sponsoring organisations. In summary, a request template is sought specifying the exact details of the delegation being sought in the root zone. In addition, various documentation is sought describing: the views of the local Internet community on a change; the competencies and skills of the organisation to operate the registry; the legal authenticity, status and character of the proposed operator; and the nature of government support for the proposal. The view of the current operator is obtained, and in the event of a redelegation, the transfer plan from the previous sponsoring organisation to the new sponsoring organisation is also assessed with a view to ensuring ongoing stable operation of the domain.</p>
		<p>After receiving these documents, the input received is analysed in relation to existing zone management procedures, seeking input from parties both related to as well as independent of the applying organization should the information provided in the original application be deficient.</p>
		<p>Once all the documentation has been received, various technical checks are performed on the proposed sponsoring organisation’s DNS infrastructure to ensure name servers are properly configured and are able to respond to queries for the top-level domain being requested.  Should any anomalies be detected in the proposed technical infrastructure, IANA staff will work with the proposed sponsoring organisation to address the issues.</p>
		<p>Assuming all issues are resolved, a report is compiled providing all relevant details regarding the proposed sponsoring organisation, its suitability for operating the top-level domain being requested, and any other information pertinent to the application and submit that report to ICANN’s Board of Directors for its determination on whether to proceed with the request.
		</p>
		<h2>Evaluation</h2>
		<p>This evaluation is being provided to the ICANN Board for consideration and decision, as 
		part of the IANA functions contract between the United States Government and ICANN. 
		Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA functions, which include receiving 
		delegation and redelegation requests concerning top-level domains, investigating the 
		circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</p>
		<p>The evaluation of the various criteria relating to the request are as follows:</p>
		<h3>Operational and technical skills</h3>
		<p>Technical operations have historically been operated by FCCN since the domain was first 
		delegated. ANAC will continue to rely on FCCN for this support, including training and 
		other requirements. Therefore there are no substantial transition concerns regarding the 
		ongoing stable function of the domain.</p> 
		<h3>Operation in country</h3>
		<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation is a governmental entity of Cape Verde. The 
		administrative contact is located within Cape Verde. </p>
		<h3>Fair and equitable treatment</h3> 
		<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation has provided rule-making, notably ANAC 
		Administrative Council Decision 4/2006, that provides for domain name registrations on 
		a basis that is fair and equitable. </p>
		<h3>Governmental support</h3>
		<p>The Government of Cape Verde supports the redelegation request, with the specific 
		request formally endorsed by Manuel Inocêncio Sousa, the Minister of Infrastructure, 
		Transport and Telecommunications.</p>
		<h3>Community sentiment</h3> 
		<p>In support of the application, letters of support were provided by four different 
		organisations – CaboCom, CV Multimédia, CV WiFi and the Universidade de Cabo 
		Verde.</p>



		<h2>Recommendation</h2>
		<p>In its decision making process on accepting delegation and redelegation requests, subject 
		to meeting the minimum stability criteria enumerated earlier, ICANN respects the ability 
		for a local Internet community as well as local law and local government to make 
		decisions about the operation of a top-level domain.</p> 
		<p>In its research, staff believes that there are grounds for reassignment of the domain name 
		under the relevant criteria.</p> 
		<p>It is therefore recommended that the .CV domain should be redelegated to the Agência 
		Nacional das Comunicações as per the request.</p>
		
		<h2>
			Postscript: Board Resolution
		</h2>
		<p>
			On 27 August 2009, the Board of ICANN passed the following resolution:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Whereas, the .CV top‐level domain is the designated country‐code for Cape Verde.</o>
			<p>Whereas, ICANN has received a request for redelegation of .CV to the Cape Verde Agencia Nacional das Comunicacoes.</p>
			<p>Whereas, ICANN has reviewed the request, and has determined that the proposed redelegation would be in the best interest of the local and global Internet communities.</p>
			<p>Resolved (2009.27.08.12), that the proposed redelegation of the .CV domain to the Agencia Nacional das Comunicacoes is approved.</p>
