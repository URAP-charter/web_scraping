		<h1>
			IANA Report on the Redelegation of the .MS Top-Level Domain
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Background
		</h2>

<p>Pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions contract with the
United States Department of Commerce, as part of the administrative tasks associated
with management of the Domain Name System root zone, ICANN is responsible for
receiving requests for the delegation and redelegation of top-level domains, investigating
and reporting on the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and, with appropriate
authorizations, implementing the redelegations.</p>

<p>In accordance with ICANN’s performance of these functions, ICANN received a request
from MNI Networks Limited for the redelegation of the .MS top-level domain on 12 May
2008. This domain is designated in the ISO 3166-1 standard for Montserrat, an Island
located in the Caribbean with a population of approximately 10,000 people.</p>

<p>The current operator of the .MS top-level domain is AdamNames Ltd, located in the
United Kingdom and is listed as the technical contact. AdamNames‘s local subsidiary is
Lubimal (MS) Ltd., which is listed as the administrative contact and sponsoring
organization.</p>

<p>The request calls for the redelegation of the .MS top-level domain to MNI Networks Ltd.
The prospective manager (MNI Networks Limited) is domiciled in Montserrat and has
been established to manage and operate the .MS country code top-level domain. The
prospective manager is affiliated with the Council of Country Code Administrations – a
registry services provider, who will provide technical backend support.</p>

<p>The Government of Montserrat supports the redelegation and has entered into an
agreement with MNI Networks Ltd. to support the growth of the Internet in Montserrat.</p>

<p>The current operator supports the redelegation and has signed a memorandum of
understanding with MNI Networks Ltd to facilitate the transition of existing registry
information to the proposed operator.</p>

<p>The proposed administrative contact is Denzil A. West and the proposed technical
contact is Dave Williams. Both contacts are representatives of MNI Networks Ltd.</p>

<h2>Evaluation Procedure</h2>

<p>In its role as investigator of delegation and redelegation requests, ICANN is guided by
the practices summarized in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/go/rfc1591">“Domain Name System Structure and Delegation”</a> (RFC 1591). This document
describes IANA function practices relating to delegations at its publication in
1994.</p></li> 
<li><p><a href="/go/icp-1">“Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation”</a> (ICP-1). This
document represents an update of the portions of RFC 1591 dealing with ccTLDs
and reflects subsequent evolution of the policies followed by ICANN through
May 1999.</p></li>
<li><p>The ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee’s Principles for Delegation and
Administration of ccTLDs (GAC Principles). This document serve as “best
practices” to guide governments in assuming proper roles with respect to the
Internet's naming system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In considering the delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, ICANN seeks input from both
the current manager and the prospective manager as well as from persons and/or
organizations that may be significantly affected by the change, particularly those within
the nation or territory to which the ccTLD is designated. As noted in ICP-1, the parties
affected include the relevant government or public authority: "The desires of the
government of a country with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously.
The IANA will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer
discussions."</p>
<p>Taking these factors into consideration, the burden of proof required to permit a
delegation action involves determining facts that relate to the applicant’s capacity to meet
the following criteria:</p>

<!--boilerplate-redelegation-criteria-html-2007v1-->
<ol>
<li><b>Operational and technical skills</b>
	<p>
	<ol type="a"><li>The prospective manager has the requisite skills to operate the TLD appropriately. (ICP-1 §a, RFC 1591 §3.5)</li>

	<li>There must be reliable, full-time IP connectivity to the nameservers and electronic mail connectivity to the operators; (ICP-1 §a; RFC 1591 §3.1)</li>
	<li>The manager must perform its duties in assigning domains and operating nameservers with technical competence (ICP-1 §d; RFC 1591 §3.5)</li>
</ol>
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Operator in country</b>
<p><ol type="a">
<li>The prospective manager supervises and operates the domain name from within the country represented by the TLD; (ICP-1 §a; RFC 1591 §3.1)</li>
<li>The prospective administrative contact must reside in the country represented by the TLD. (ICP-1 §a; RFC 1591 §3.1)</li>
</ol>
</p></li>
<li><b>Equitable treatment</b>
<p>
	<ol type="a">
<li>The prospective manager must be equitable and fair to all groups encompassed by the TLD that may request domain names (ICP-1 §c; RFC 1591 §3.3)</li>
</ol>
</p><li><b>Community/Governmental support</b>
<p>	<ol type="a">
		<li>The prospective manager has the requisite authority to operate the TLD appropriately, with the desire of the government taken very seriously. (ICP-1 §a, GAC Principles)</li>
		<li>Significantly interested parties in the domain should agree that the prospective manager is the appropriate party to receive the delegation (ICP-1 §a; RFC 1591 §3.4)</li>
	</ol>
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In meeting these criteria, ICANN requests information from the applicant. In summary, a
request template is sought specifying the exact details of the delegation being sought in
the root zone. ICANN staff also asks for various documentation describing: the views of
the local Internet community on a change; the competencies and skills of the organization
to operate the registry; the legal authenticity, status and character of the proposed
operator; and the nature of government support for the proposal.</p>
<p>After receiving these documents, ICANN analyzes the input received in relation to
existing zone management procedures, seeking input from parties both related to as well
as independent of the applying organization should the information provided by the
applicant in their request be deficient.</p>
<p>Once all the documentation has been received, ICANN will also perform various
technical checks on the proposed operator’s DNS infrastructure to ensure name servers
are properly configured and are able to respond to queries for the top-level domain being
requested. Should any anomalies be detected in the applicant’s technical infrastructure,
ICANN staff will work with the applicant to address the issues.</p>
<p>Assuming all technical issues are resolved, ICANN staff will compile a report, providing
all relevant details regarding the applicant, its suitability for operating the top-level
domain being requested, and any other information pertinent to the application and
submit that report to ICANN’s Board of Directors for its determination on whether to
proceed with the request.</p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>This report is being provided under the contract for performance of the IANA functions
between the United States Government and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN
performs the IANA functions, which includes receiving delegation and redelegation
requests concerning top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those
requests, and reporting on the requests.</p>
<p>Pertaining to the obligations described in the evaluation procedure, in summary ICANN
has assessed the prospective manager’s credentials according to RFC 1591 and ICP-1
criteria, and found the results to be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Operational and technical skills</b></p>
<p>The prospective manager has provided documentation of policies and procedures
they have developed for managing the domain. They have engaged a number of
existing registry operators to assist them in setting up the new registry functions.
Their proposed name server operations meet the technical criteria applied to
existing TLD operators. To the extent feasible and according to IANA function
process, this verifies the capability for the proposed operator to successfully
operate the registry while respecting the ability to for a local Internet community
to make decisions about the operation of a TLD. (ICP-1 §a, RFC 1591 §3.5)</p>
<li><p><b>Operator in country</b></p>
<p>The prospective manager and proposed sponsoring organization (MNI Networks
Ltd) and the administrative contact both reside in Montserrat. (ICP-1 §a; RFC
1591 §3.1)</p></li>
<li><p><b>Equitable treatment</b></p>
<p>The prospective manager has made undertakings to ICANN that registrations will
be performed on a first-come, first-served basis that is fair and equitable. (ICP-1
§c; RFC 1591 §3.3)</p></li>
<li><p><b>Governmental support</b></p>
<p>ICANN has received written support for the application from the Government of
Montserrat, signed by Dr. Lowell Lewis, Hon. Chief Minister & Minister of
Finance, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. (ICP-1 §a, GAC
Principles)</p></li>
<li><p><b>Community sentiment</b></p>
<p>The prospective manager has provided statements of local Internet community
support as part of the application. It also has the support of the current manager,
who has agreed to provide assistance in the form of registry data to the proposed
new operator to facilitate a transfer of operations. Given the small population of
the country, there is not a well-established and cohesive local Internet community.
(ICP-1 §a; RFC 1591 §3.4)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<p>As described in RFC 1591 and ICP-1, the IANA function is required to respect the ability
for a local Internet community as well as local law and local government to make
decisions about the operation of a TLD.</p>
<p>In its research, ICANN staff believes that there are grounds for reassignment of the
domain name under the relevant criteria.</p>
<p>ICANN therefore concludes that the .MS domain should be redelegated to MNI
Networks Ltd as per their request.</p>

<h2>Postscript: Board Resolution</h2>
<p>On 28 August 2008 the Board of ICANN passed the following resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas, the .MS top-level domain is the designated country-code for Montserrat.</p>
<p>Whereas, ICANN has received a request for redelegation of .MS to MNI Networks Ltd.</p>
<p>Whereas, ICANN has reviewed the request, and has determined that the proposed redelegation would be in the best interest of the local and global Internet communities.</p>
<p>It is hereby resolved (2008.08.28.01), that the proposed redelegation of the .MS domain to MNI Networks Ltd is approved.</p>
