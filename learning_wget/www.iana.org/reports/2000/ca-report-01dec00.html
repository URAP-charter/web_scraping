        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), 
          as part of the administrative functions associated with management of 
          the domain-name system (DNS) root, is responsible for receiving requests 
          for delegation and redelegation of top-level domains (TLDs), investigating 
          the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the 
          requests. The IANA has received a request for redelegation of the .ca 
          (Canada) country-code TLD (ccTLD). This report gives the findings and 
          conclusions of the IANA on its investigation of that request.</FONT></P>
        <P><A NAME="Factualand ProceduralBackground"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Factual 
          and Procedural Background</FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In May 1987, the University of Southern California's 
          <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute</A> (which 
          then performed the IANA functions) approved a request for initial delegation 
          of the .ca ccTLD. At that time and today, that two-letter code was and 
          is set forth on the <A
      HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">ISO 
          3166-1 list</A> maintained by the <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html">ISO 
          3166 Maintenance Agency</A> (ISO 3166/MA) &lt;<A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html</A>&gt; 
          as the approved alpha-2 code for Canada.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The original delegation of the .ca ccTLD was made 
          naming the <A HREF="http://www.ubc.edu/">University of British Columbia</A> 
          in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, as the sponsoring organization 
          and John Demco of that university as both administrative and technical 
          contact. Over the next decade, the .ca ccTLD was operated by Mr. Demco 
          and a committee of dedicated volunteers across Canada. It is now used 
          extensively by Internet users within Canada, with approximately 120,000 
          names registered under the .ca ccTLD as of 30 November 2000.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Although these volunteer efforts served the Canadian 
          Internet community well for a full decade, by 1997 the growth of the 
          Internet and electronic commerce caused the community to begin contemplating 
          a change. Discussions that year at the Canadian Internet community's 
          annual conference led to the formation of the Canadian Domain Names 
          Consultation Committee to investigate transitioning the current management 
          of the .ca ccTLD to a means of operation more appropriate to the requirements 
          caused by the evolving character of the Internet. Following a public 
          consultation, the Committee recommended that a private-sector, not-for-profit 
          corporation be set up to take over the administration of .ca. On 30 
          December 1998, the <A HREF="http://www.cira.ca/">Canadian Internet Registration 
          Authority</A> (CIRA) was incorporated as a not-for-profit corportation 
          with the intention of managing the .ca ccTLD in the public interest.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In an <A HREF="/reports/industry-canada-letter-11mar99.htm">11 
          March 1999 letter</A>, the Government of Canada gave its recognition 
          to CIRA as the appropriate administrator of the .ca ccTLD. This recognition, 
          which was consistent with the Government of Canada's &quot;Reform of 
          the Domain Name System: Current Developments &amp; Statement of Principles&quot; 
          &lt;<a href="http://e-com.ic.gc.ca/english/strat/651d2.html">http://e-com.ic.gc.ca/english/strat/651d2.html</a>&gt;, 
          was based on the Government's expectation that CIRA would put in place 
          an effective structure predicated upon:</FONT></P>
        <UL>
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">conducting CIRA's activities in an open and transparent 
            manner that ensures wide public access to all relevant information;</FONT> 
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">following fair and sound business practices;</FONT> 
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">ensuring an appropriate balance of representation, 
            accountability and diversity on the Board of Directors for all categories 
            of stakeholders;</FONT> 
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">applying for domain names being as quick and 
            easy as applying for domain names in other top level domains, and 
            priced competitively;</FONT> 
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">reducing conflicts between persons granted domain 
            names and other rights holders, including trade-marks or business 
            names; and</FONT> 
          <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a system that facilitates and encourages entry 
            for new players including registrars.</FONT> 
        </UL>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">While strongly encouraging private-sector leadership 
          in achieving these goals, the 11 March 1999 letter also pledged the 
          Government's continuing advice and assistance in achieving these goals.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">CIRA, the University of British Columbia, and the 
          Government of Canada entered into an <A HREF="/reports/ubc-cira-canada-umbrella-agreement-09may00.htm">Umbrella 
          Agreement</A> as of 9 May 2000 that stated that &quot;the .ca domain 
          space should be developed as a key public resource for social and economic 
          development for all Canadians.&quot; In the Umbrella Agreement, the 
          Government of Canada designated CIRA to manage the .ca ccTLD in accordance 
          with the principles and structure set out in the 11 March 1999 letter. 
          CIRA and the University of British Columbia pledged to cooperate in 
          orderly transition of the .ca ccTLD's management. The Agreement requires 
          CIRA to manage, operate, and control the .ca ccTLD in accordance with 
          the public-interest principles of the 11 March 1999 letter and any supplemental 
          principles that are in the public interest and reasonable. The designation 
          of CIRA continues indefinitely, subject to termination in the event 
          that the Government of Canada reasonably determines that CIRA is unable 
          to continue operating the .ca ccTLD in accordance with those principles. 
          In the Agreement, CIRA confirmed that its stewardship over the .ca ccTLD 
          does not give rise to property rights in CIRA to the .ca ccTLD and agreed, 
          in the event transfer to a newly designated manager of the .ca ccTLD 
          is necessary, to cooperate in that transfer.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">After entry of the Umbrella Agreement, CIRA and 
          the University of British Columbia began implementing an orderly, gradual 
          transition to CIRA's management of the .ca ccTLD. CIRA has developed 
          new policies for administration of the .ca ccTLD. Among those policies 
          is a system for the provision of registration services by numerous, 
          competitive registrars; Canadian Presence Requirements providing that 
          registrants in the .ca ccTLD have a substantial, bona fide connection 
          with Canada; and registration rules. CIRA is presently in the process 
          of developing, through an open consultation involving the Canadian Internet 
          community, an alternative dispute-resolution mechanism for domain-name 
          disputes in the .ca ccTLD. In October 2000, a CIRA-administered nameserver 
          was added to the .ca nameserver constellation to permit the transfer 
          to be conducted in a highly stable manner.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In a <A HREF="/reports/industry-canada-letter-10oct00.htm">10 
          October 2000 letter to Michael M. Roberts</A>, President the the Internet 
          Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the Government of 
          Canada communicated that it was formally designating CIRA as the Government's 
          designee to be the .ca delegee. The letter provided a designated point 
          of contact within the Government of Canada. With the letter, the Government 
          provided to ICANN copies of the 11 March 1999 letter and the 9 May 2000 
          Umbrella Agreement, setting forth the terms and conditions of the designation 
          and requirements for CIRA's management of the delegation. Subsequently, 
          the IANA has been provided with CIRA's contact details regarding CIRA.</FONT></P>

          November 2000 letter to Mr. Roberts</A>, CIRA requested redelegation 
          of the .ca ccTLD effective 1 December 2000. In the letter, CIRA expressed 
          its willingness to enter into a formal, legally binding agreement with 
          ICANN that promotes the operation of the .ca ccTLD in a stable and secure 
          manner; that ensures the safety and integrity of the registry database; 
          that facilitates transfer of all relevant DNS data to a replacement 
          delegee, if, for any reason, reassignment is necessary; that commits 
          CIRA to complying with ICANN-developed policies that concern interoperability 
          of the .ca ccTLD with other parts of the DNS and Internet, operational 
          capabilities and performance of CIRA, and the obtaining and maintenance 
          of (and public access to) accurate and up-to-date contact information 
          for domain name registrants; and that provides for CIRA's contribution 
          to ICANN's cost of operation in accordance with an equitable scale,

            does] not alter root system responsibilities defined in Amendment 
            11 of the Cooperative Agreement.</FONT></P>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently 
          follows the practices summarized in &quot;Internet Domain Name System 
          Structure and Delegation&quot; (<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1</A>). 
          ICP-1 represents an update of the portions of <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
          1591</A> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, to reflect 
          evolution of the policies followed by the IANA through May 1999.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, 
          the IANA seeks input from persons concerned or affected by the transfer, 
          particularly those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has 
          been established to benefit.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The IANA's redelegation procedures recognize that, 
          where the affected stakeholders can come to agreement about how a ccTLD 
          should be operated, the result is often more satisfactory than that 
          achieved where the parties cannot agree and the IANA is required to 
          actively resolve the dispute. Here, the present ccTLD manager, John 
          Demco of the University of British Columbia, and the proposed new manager, 
          CIRA, have worked cooperatively to achieve a transition that is designed 
          to promote an administration of the .ca ccTLD that meets the evolving 
          needs of the Canadian Internet community as well as the global Internet 
          community.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Government of Canada has also expressed its 
          support for the structure and principles underlying CIRA and for transfer 
          of the responsibility for management of the .ca ccTLD to CIRA. As Dr 
          Postel observed in <A HREF="/cctld/cctld-news1.htm">ccTLD News Memo 
          #1</A> and as <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">reiterated 
          in ICP-1</A>, the views of the government of the affected nation or 
          territory are taken very seriously in delegation and redelegation matters. 
          As noted in the <A HREF="/reports/pn-report-11feb00.htm">IANA Report 
          on Request for Redelegation of the .pn Top-Level Domain</A>, governmental 
          views are particularly pertinent when the government is fulfilling its 
          role of promoting management of the ccTLD in the public interest.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here, the participation of the Government of Canada 
          is especially significant. In their Umbrella Agreement, the Government 
          and CIRA have crafted mechanisms that facilitate input from the Government, 
          which has general responsibility within Canada for promoting the public 
          interest and ultimately represents the interests of the people of Canada, 
          while ensuring that CIRA enjoys, in the execution of its responsibilities, 
          appropriate rights under applicable law. In particular, the Umbrella 
          Agreement envisions private-sector leadership, with governmental guidance 
          stated in broad, public-interest terms, and requires that any governmental 
          action to replace CIRA be justified by substantial reasons. The Government 
          of Canada, moreover, has recognized ICANN's primary responsibility for 
          establishing, disseminating, and overseeing implementation of the technical 
          standards and practices that relate to the operation of the global DNS.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">CIRA, for its part, has not only entered into the 
          Umbrella Agreement with the Government of Canada but has also committed 
          to enter into an agreement with ICANN providing for operation of the 
          .ca ccTLD in a manner that facilitates ICANN's performance of its global 
          coordination responsibilities. CIRA's commitment provides the framework 
          for a stable and appropriate agreement between ICANN and CIRA as contemplated 
          by <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/general/amend2-jpamou-07sep00.htm#C6">section 
          V.C.6 of the Memorandum of Understanding</A> between the United States 
          Department of Commerce and ICANN, as amended by Amendment 2.</FONT></P>
        <P><A NAME="Conclusion"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Conclusion</FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In sum, there has been broad stakeholder participation 
          in CIRA's formation and its development of new registration policies 
          for the .ca ccTLD. The proposed redelegation to CIRA has the clear support 
          of the Canadian Internet community. The commitments of CIRA and the 
          Government of Canada lay the basis for a set of legal relationships 
          that will ensure that those two entities and ICANN can perform their 
          respective responsibilities for stable operation of the .ca ccTLD in 
          the interests of the Canadian and global Internet communities.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is therefore the IANA's conclusion that the .ca 
          top-level domain should be redelegated as requested by CIRA. ICANN and 
          CIRA should promptly work toward reducing CIRA's commitments to a formal 
          written agreement. As the Department of Commerce has recognized in Amendment 
          2, entry into and implementation of stable and appropriate agreements 
          between ICANN and ccTLD managers is vital to achievement of the transition 
          to private-sector technical management of the Internet envisioned by 
          the White Paper. Accordingly, after conclusion of a CIRA-ICANN agreement 
          providing for stable and appropriate relationships among CIRA, the Government 
          of Canada, and ICANN, the Department of Commerce should establish revised 
          procedures for maintenance of the .ca entry in the root zone file that 
          enable ICANN to perform its obligations under its agreement with CIRA 
          and that permit moving forward responsibly with the transition to private-sector 
          technical management of the Internet.</FONT></P>
