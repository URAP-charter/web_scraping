      <p><font face="Arial">The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), 
        as part of the administrative functions associated with management of 
        the domain-name system root, is responsible for receiving requests for 
        delegation and redelegation of top-level domains, investigating the circumstances 
        pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests. In September 
        1997, the IANA received a request for redelegation of the .pn (Pitcairn 
        Island) top-level domain. This report gives the findings and conclusions 
        of the IANA on its investigation of that request.</font></p>

   face="Arial">Factual and Procedural Background</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On July 10, 1997, the IANA approved a request for 
        initial delegation of the top-level domain .pn. At that time and today, 
        that two-letter code was and is set forth on the <a
  href="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">ISO 
        3166-1</a> maintained by the <a href="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html">ISO 
        3166 Maintenance Agency</a> (ISO 3166/MA) &lt;<a href="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html">http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html</a>&gt; 
        as the approved Alpha-2 code for Pitcairn Island.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Pitcairn Island is an overseas territory of the United 
        Kingdom. (<a href="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/pc.html">The 
        territory is formally known as Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno Islands, 
        due to the inclusion of some outlying islets.</a>) The territory, located 
        in the South Pacific at 25&ordm; 04' S, 130&ordm; 06' W, has a total population 
        consisting of approximately 50 descendants of the Bounty mutineers and 
        their Tahitian wives. Local government of Pitcairn Island consists of 
        an Island Council elected mostly by the inhabitants of the island (with 
        a few appointed members) and an elected Island Magistrate and Chairman 
        of the Island Council. The UK Government appoints a Governor of the territory 
        and a Commissioner responsible for liaison between the Governor and the 
        Island Council.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Pitcairn Island's telephone service consists of a 
        local party-line telephone system. International telephone service is 
        limited to Inmarsat service within a daily window. The local system is 
        not presently capable of transmitting e-mail. The island has no airstrip. 
        The economy consists of subsistence farming, fishing, and handicrafts 
        made for sale to passing ships.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The original delegation of the .pn top-level domain 
        was made in the name of Tom Christian as administrative contact and Nigel 
        Roberts as technical contact. The listed organization was Pitcairn Names 
        (Orichalk Ltd). Mr Christian (the great-great-great grandson of Fletcher 
        Christian) is resident on Pitcairn. Mr Roberts is a private computer consultant 
        with an address in the Channel Islands and is associated with Orichalk 
        Ltd. The .pn top-level domain has been used predominantly for registration 
        of domain names to entities not affiliated with the territory, in exchange 
        for a fee collected by Orichalk.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Shortly after the initial delegation was made, on 
        September 8, 1997 Leon Salt, <a href="/reports/pn-commissioner-request-08sep97.jpg">Commissioner 
        for Pitcairn Island, wrote to the IANA</a> stating that:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial">The Government of Pitcairn Island has concluded, 
          after due process of examination and consultation, that the persons 
          who have assumed the management of the PN top-level domain, currently 
          registered at IANA, do not adequately serve the interests os [sic] the 
          country and community of Pitcairn Island.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial">The letter requested revocation of the delegation 
        to Messrs Christian and Roberts and a redelegation to the Office of the 
        Governor of Pitcairn Island, with nameservice to be provided by a consultant 
        in New Zealand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On October 16, 1997, the IANA requested that Commissioner 
        Salt contact Mr Roberts to discuss and seek to resolve the situation by 
        agreement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On October 24, 1997, the Pitcairn Island Council met 
        on the island and requested the Commissioner, Leon Salt, who was then 
        visiting, to seek transfer of the .pn top-level domain to the Pitcairn 
        Island Administration (located in New Zealand). In a letter dated November 
        3, 1997, the Chairman of the Island Council and Chief Island Magistrate, 
        Jay Warren, conveyed the <a href="/reports/pn-council-request-03nov97.jpg">sentiments 
        of the Council</a> to Commissioner Salt:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial">At our meeting held on the 24th of October 1997, 
          the island council has requested me to convey to you that we would like 
          the Pitcairn Island administration to obtain the domain name &quot;pn&quot; 
          for exclusive use in reference to Pitcairn Island. The Island Council 
          feels it is important to ensure the name &quot;Pitcairn Island&quot; 
          and its abbreviated form &quot;pn&quot; should serve the interest of 
          Pitcairn Island and the islanders rather than the interest of any individual 
          or organisation not connected with the island.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial">Commissioner Salt forwarded this letter to the IANA 
        and requested a redelegation of the .pn domain naming the Commissioner 
        as administrative contact.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">In an e-mail to the IANA dated November 18, 1997, 
        Commissioner Salt stated that the original delegates were not providing 
        any service for the community and noted plans, under the requested redelegation, 
        to pr ovide Internet access to the Island by implementing a functioning 
        e-mail system.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">By e-mail to the IANA, Mr Roberts expressed his objection, 
        and conveyed Mr Christian's objection, to the redelegation. There ensued, 
        at Mr Roberts' behest, a series of discussions in the UK Government, and 
        Mr Roberts reported to the IANA in a November 23, 1997 e-mail that &quot;the 
        very highest level in London&quot; was considering whether to recommend 
        a course contrary to the request of the Pitcairn Island Council. A meeting 
        was held on January 23, 1998 among Mr Roberts and various UK Government 
        officials, but the UK Government continued to support the Pitcairn Island 
        Council's request and no resolution was achieved.<br>
        <br>
        On July 21, 1998, Baroness Simons, the UK Government Minister with responsibility 
        for UK Overseas Territories, including Pitcairn Island, wrote to the IANA 
        requesting redelegation consistent with the wishes of the Pitcairn Island 
        Council. On July 28, 1998, Commissioner Salt reiterated the Pitcairn Island 
        Administration's request for redelegation. On August 3, 1998, Mr Roberts 
        sent the IANA another e-mail objecting to redelegation as requested by 
        the Pitcairn Island Council. On August 14, 1998, Dr Postel (then Director 
        of the IANA) wrote to Baroness Simons expressing concern that Mr Roberts 
        had not cooperated with the transfer that had been requested and suggesting 
        that she contact Mr Roberts to seek to achieve a cooperative resolution.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On September 8, 1998, Baroness Simons wrote to the 
        IANA expressing regret over Mr Roberts' lack of cooperation and stating 
        that the original delegation violated the guidelines of RFC 1591 in that 
        the administrative contact (Mr Christian) did not have a direct link to 
        the Internet. She also noted that the Island Council should have been 
        consulted when the delegation was made.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On September 22, 1998, the IANA advised Mr Roberts 
        of its belief that the redelegation would be appropriate. On September 
        23, 1998, Mr Roberts replied again, once again objecting. After receipt 
        of this letter, the redelegation was delayed. No activity occurred at 
        the IANA on this matter for some time, due to Dr. Postel's death on October 
        16, 1998, and the transition of responsibility for performing the IANA 
        function from the University of Southern California to the Internet Corporation 
        for Assigned Names and Numbers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On September 2, 1999, Commissioner Salt forwarded 
        to the IANA a <a href="/reports/pn-petition-02sep99.jpg">petition signed 
        by Pitcairn residents</a> requesting the redelegation:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial">We, the undersigned, being residents of Pitcairn 
          Island, do hereby request and require that the management of our nation's 
          Internet Top-Level Domain (.pn.) be reassigned forthwith to the Pitcairn 
          Island Administration in Auckland, New Zealand, in accordance with the 
          Island Council's instructions of 24th October 1997 and the letter from 
          the Government of Pitcairn Island to IANA of September 1997.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial">In his accompanying e-mail, Commissioner Salt noted 
        that the petition had been &quot;signed by the entire resident adult population 
        of Pitcairn Island (excluding other nationals), with the exception of 
        two members of the community. Those two are Tom Christian, who is the 
        present designated administrative contact, and his wife.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On September 3, 1999, Mr Roberts sent the IANA a message, 
        once again objecting to the redelegation that had been requested by the 
        Pitcairn Island Council and by the petition of the Pitcairn residents.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">By a letter dated October 27, 1999, Tom Christian, 
        the administrative contact for the .pn top-level domain, announced his 
        support for the redelegation:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial">Following discussions with the resident community, 
          Island Council, Information Technology advisers, and Government of the 
          island, I now wish to change the delegation of the management of the 
          tld as detailed below.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">At this time, our island does not have the telecommunications 
          infrastructure required for affordable Internet access for island residents. 
          I am satisfied, however, that under the new tld management, we will 
          have the best opportunity for the introduction of such infrastructure, 
          bringing the benefits of the Internet to the whole community here.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">* * *</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Please make the change to the new management with 
          immediate effect.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial">Mr Christian accompanied his letter with a modification 
        template requesting redelegation as sought by the Island Council and the 
        petition.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On December 1, 1999, Mr Roberts sent the IANA an e-mail 
        that mentioned a possible compromise based on restructuring of the .pn 
        domain. Mr Roberts also agreed to voluntarily suspend accepting registrations 
        for the .pn domain.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On December 17, 1999, the IANA sent Mr Roberts an 
        e-mail notifying him that the IANA was investigating the request for redelegation 
        of the .pn top-level domain and summarizing the principal correspondence 
        the IANA had received on the matter. Mr Roberts was invited to submit 
        any additional comments he might have on the matter by December 31, 1999. 
        The IANA's e-mail also suggested that Mr Roberts convey his compromise 
        proposal directly to Commissioner Salt.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On December 27, 1999, Mr Roberts requested additional 
        time to respond to the December 17 e-mail. On December 30, 1999, the IANA 
        extended its invitation for responses until January 10, 2000, and indicated 
        that no further delays should be expected. On January 4, 2000, Ron Collins, 
        who is also affiliated with Orichalk, indicated that Mr Roberts would 
        no longer be involved with the .pn top-level domain at Orichalk. Mr Collins 
        also requested an additional extension of time (until January 31, 2000) 
        to respond to the December 17 IANA e-mail. No substantive response has 
        been received since then; instead, on January 31, 2000 Mr Collins requested 
        yet another extension, for thirty more days.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">On January 19, 2000, the Head of the Overseas Territories 
        Department of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office wrote the IANA to 
        advise that he had received a compromise proposal from Mr Collins, but 
        that, after fully considering the proposal in good faith and with the 
        interests of the Internet community in mind, the Pitcairn Island Administration 
        (PIA) did not find the proposal acceptable. He also noted that &quot;[t]he 
        PIA and the UK Government are also agreed that the Pitcairn community, 
        as the appropriate party, should be allowed to determine the management 
        and administration of .pn.&quot;</font></p>

          Agreement.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial">An important component of Internet stability is adherence 
        to past practices in delegation and redelegation matters. Those practices 
        are summarized in &quot;Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; 
        (<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1</a>), which was issued 
        in May 1999 to reflect &quot;the current policies being followed by the 
        Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in administering delegations 
        of Top Level Domain Names of the Internet Domain Names System (DNS).&quot; 
        ICP-1 represents an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</a> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, to reflect 
        evolution of the policies followed by the IANA through May 1999. Although 
        there is ongoing consideration within the ICANN process of proposals for 
        changes in policies concerning ccTLDs, no significant policies have yet 
        been adopted that are at variance with ICP-1.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">A fundamental principle reflected in ICP-1 is that 
        ccTLDs are intended to be operated for the benefit of the Internet community 
        in the nation or other territory with which the country-code is associated. 
        As Dr Postel wrote in RFC 1591 (and as <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#b">repeated 
        in ICP-1</a>):</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial">The designated manager is the trustee of the TLD 
          for both the nation, in the case of ccTLDs, and the global Internet 
          community. Concerns about &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;ownership&quot; 
          of domains are inappropriate. It is appropriate, however, to be concerned 
          about &quot;responsibilities&quot; and &quot;service&quot; to the community.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial">Thus, in matters of delegation and redelegation of 
        a ccTLD, the IANA seeks input from persons concerned or affected by the 
        transfer, particularly those within the nation or territory which the 
        ccTLD has been established to benefit. As Dr Postel observed in <a href="http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-news1.htm">ccTLD 
        News Memo #1</a> and as <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">reiterated 
        in ICP-1</a>, the views of the government of the affected nation or territory 
        are taken very seriously in this regard. Governmental views are particularly 
        pertinent when the government is fulfilling its role of promoting management 
        of the ccTLD in the public interest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">ccTLDs have been established to facilitate and promote 
        the dispersion of the Internet globally. They allow the designated manager 
        to adapt operations of the ccTLD to best meet the economic, cultural, 
        and linguistic circumstances of the nation or territory involved.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">In the case of a remote or developing nation or territory 
        that has not yet attained affordable Internet access, such as Pitcairn 
        Island, &quot;proxy&quot; DNS service outside of the nation or territory 
        may be appropriate &quot;as a temporary form of assistance to the creation 
        of Internet connectivity in new areas.&quot; (<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">ICP-1, 
        section (a)</a>)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">A key theme in the IANA's evaluation of redelegation 
        matters is that the contending parties should seek to achieve a consensual 
        solution to any disputes. As noted in ICP-1:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial">On a few occasions, the parties involved in proposed 
          delegations or transfers have not been able to reach an agreement and 
          the IANA has been required to resolve the matter. This is usually a 
          long drawn out process, leaving at least one party unhappy, so it is 
          far better when the parties can reach an agreement among themselves. 
          [<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#e">ICP-1, section (e)</a>]</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial">In this matter, for over two years the contending 
        parties have discussed possible resolutions, but no consensual solution 
        has been achieved. It is apparent that this is one of those circumstances 
        in which non-consensual resolution is necessary.</font></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#f"><font face="Arial">Section 
        (f) of ICP-1</font></a><font face="Arial"> discusses how redelegation 
        requests are to be handled:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial">(f) Revocation of TLD Delegation. In cases where 
          there is misconduct, or violation of the policies set forth in this 
          document and RFC 1591, or persistent, recurring problems with the proper 
          operation of a domain, the IANA reserves the right to revoke and to 
          redelegate a Top Level Domain to another manager.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial">Several factors appear to make the present case particularly 
        appropriate for redelgation:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><a name="1"></a><font face="Arial">1. All residents of Pitcairn Island,

          which is the duly constituted local government, has formally requested 
          the redelegation on behalf of the residents of the island.</font></p>
        <p><a name="4"></a><font face="Arial">4. The UK Government, which administers 
          the territory's affairs, has given its support to the request of the 
          Pitcairn residents and their local government.</font></p>
        <p><a name="5"></a><font face="Arial">5. The existing delegation, which 
          has been in place for over two years, has not resulted in the introduction 
          of reliable Internet connectivity on Pitcairn or in any other benefit 
          to the relevant community.</font></p>
        <p><a name="6"></a><font face="Arial">6. The proposed new contacts (technical 
          and administrative) have the technical qualifications to operate the 
          ccTLD, have recognized their duty to operate the ccTLD for the benefit 
          of the relevant community, and have put forward plans that would advance 
          both the development of the Internet on Pitcairn and the interests of 
          the Pitcairn community. These plans include (a) implementation of reliable 
          e-mail connectivity on the island; (b) establishment of an official 
          website at a .pn address to provide information to prospective tourists, 
          and (c) creation of a .gov.pn subdomain to support the activities of 
          the Pitcairn Island Administration. The operation of the .pn domain 
          by nonresident commercial interests in this case appears to have thwarted 
          these plans and is interfering with introduction of the Internet to 
          the Pitcairn Island community.</font></p>
