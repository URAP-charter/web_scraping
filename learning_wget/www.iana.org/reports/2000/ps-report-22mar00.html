      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Internet Assigned Numbers 
        Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative functions associated 
        with management of the domain-name system root, is responsible for receiving 
        requests for delegation and redelegation of top-level domains, investigating 
        the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests. 
        In early 1997, the IANA received a request for delegation of a top-level 
        domain for Palestine. That request was initially declined, but was renewed 
        in October 1999. This report gives the findings and conclusions of the 
        IANA on its investigation of these requests.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A NAME="FactualandProceduralBackground"></A><B>Factual 
        and Procedural Background</B></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In February 1997, the IANA 
        received inquiries about the possibility of delegating a country-code 
        top-level domain (ccTLD) for Palestine.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Country-code top-level domains 
        in the Internet domain-name system are designated by two-letter codes 
        (&quot;alpha-2 codes&quot;) shown on the <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">ISO 
        3166-1 list</A> maintained by the <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html">ISO 
        3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA)</A>. That list consists of codes 
        given in the UN Bulletin &quot;Country Names&quot; and in the code list 
        of the &quot;Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use.&quot; 
        There is also provision for assignment of codes by the Maintenance Agency 
        in certain limited circumstances in response to a request of the affected 
        national government or national standards body. The ISO 3166-1 list is 
        used worldwide in many applications involving coded information concerning 
        names of countries and of physically separated dependent territories.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the time of the 1997 inquiries, 
        no code for Palestine was included on the ISO 3166-1 list. Instead, in 
        November 1995 the United Nations Statistics Division had included the 
        name &quot;Palestine&quot; on an interim list of area names and, in response, 
        the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency agreed to set aside the alpha-2 code &quot;ps&quot; 
        to represent the name &quot;Palestine&quot; in the event a later decision 
        was made to include Palestine on the ISO 3166-1 list. In practical effect, 
        such a reservation means that the code reserved should not be used to 
        refer to any other country, territory, or region. In April 1996 the Maintenance 
        Agency formally moved the &quot;ps&quot; code to its <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/reserved.html">list 
        of reserved code elements</A> under the category of &quot;exceptional 
        reservations.&quot; At that time, it did not assign the &quot;ps&quot; 
        code to Palestine on the ISO 3166-1 list.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because no code for Palestine 
        was then on the ISO 3166-1 list, in May 1997, the IANA declined to delegate 
        a ccTLD to Palestine.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In April 1998 the IANA indicated 
        that it would delegate the second-level domain &quot;palestine.int,&quot; 
        based on Palestine's Status as a Permanent Observer to the United Nations. 
        The IANA noted that this registration was to be &quot;in lieu of a current 
        top level domain for Palestine and would eventually be transferred to 
        the top level domain when the TLD is accepted by the ISO 3166 Maintenance 
        Agency.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr Ghassan Z. Qadah, the Supervisor-General 
        of the <A HREF="http://www.nic.ps/">Government Computer Center</A> in 
        Palestine as well as the Senior Advisor for Technology to the Palestine 
        Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, was proposed to become 
        the designated administrative contact for palestine.int. On 14 May 1998, 
        after investigation showed overwhelming community support for this appointment, 
        the IANA delegated palestine.int, with Dr Qadah named as administrative 
        contact and Dr Yaser Dolah named as technical contact. The palestine.int 
        domain has been in operation since, being used in a limited way for a 
        governmental-purposes third-level domain (gov.palestine.int).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In summer 1999, the United 
        Nations Statistics Division notified the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency that 
        it had included &quot;Occupied Palestinian Territory&quot; on the United 
        Nations list of Standard Country and Area Codes for Statistical Use. On 
        30 September 1999, the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency <A
        HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/new10_99.html">announced</A> 
        that effective 1 October 1999 it was adding the alpha-2 code &quot;ps&quot; 
        to the ISO 3166-1 list to designate &quot;Occupied Palestinian Territory.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 11 October 1999, Drs Qadah 
        and Doleh applied to the IANA for delegation of the .ps top-level domain. 
        Dr Qadah is a computer scientist with a specialty in database algorithms 
        and, as noted above, has headed the Government Computer Center for the 
        Palestinian Authority for several years. Dr Doleh, who resides in New 
        York State, USA, holds a PhD in computer science from Kent State and has 
        done work in system-independent user interfaces.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 2 February 2000, Dr Nabeel 
        Shaath, Minister of Planning &amp; International Cooperation of the Palestinian 
        Authority, wrote to the IANA stating that his ministry and the Government 
        Computer Center had been entrusted with receiving, managing, operating, 
        and regulating the Palestinian top-level domain.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The IANA has conducted a follow-up 
        to its earlier investigation of the proposed managers, including a review 
        of the Government Computer Center's plans to establish the Palestinian 
        Network Information Center to manage the .ps top-level domain. The IANA 
        finds the plan to be technically sound and to be well-suited to meet the 
        needs of academic, commercial, governmental, and other existing and future 
        Internet users in Palestine. The Government Computer Center is the only 
        information-technology planning unit in Palestine, having led the Y2K 
        campaign there, and has contributed substantially to making the Internet 
        available in Palestine. The IANA's follow-up investigation turned up nothing 
        to show a diminution in the previously observed community support for 
        the applicants serving as trustees for the community as designated managers 
        of a domain for Palestine.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This report is being provided 
        under the 9 February 2000 <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-09feb00.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</A> between the United States Government 
        and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Under that 
        contract, the IANA is responsible for receiving delegation requests, investigating 
        the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The policies currently followed 
        in connection with the delegation of Internet top-level domains are summarized 
        in &quot;Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; (<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1</A>), 
        which was issued in May 1999 to reflect &quot;the current policies being 
        followed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in administering 
        delegations of Top Level Domain Names of the Internet Domain Names System 
        (DNS).&quot; ICP-1 represents an update of the portions of <A HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</A> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, to reflect 
        evolution of the policies followed by the IANA through May 1999. Although 
        there is ongoing consideration within the ICANN process of proposals for 
        changes in policies concerning ccTLDs, no significant policies have yet 
        been adopted that are at variance with ICP-1.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The delegation request raises 
        two principal issues: (a) should a .ps ccTLD be delegated and, (b) if 
        so, are the proposed managers the appropriate ones.</font></p>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>

          .ps top-level domain should be delegated</U>.</B></font></p>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A threshold issue is whether 
        a .ps top-level should be delegated at all, in view of Palestine's special 
        status. This issue is answered by <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#i">section 
        (i) of ICP-1</A>, which makes the <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">ISO 
        3166-1 table</A> the authoritative reference as to which ccTLDs are subject 
        to delegation. Assessments regarding sovereignty and nationhood are not 
        among the IANA's functions. Indeed, many of the alpha-2 codes included 
        on the ISO 3166-1 list, for which ccTLDs have been established and delegated, 
        are plainly not &quot;countries&quot; at all, but are instead dependencies 
        of other countries. Examples include <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/hm.html">Heard 
        Island and McDonald Islands</A> (.hm) (a territory of Australia), <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/nt.html">Netherlands 
        Antilles</A> (.an) (part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), and <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rq.html">Puerto 
        Rico</A> (.pr) (a commonwealth associated with the US). A top-level domain 
        for <A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html">Antarctica</A> 
        (.aq), which also appears on the ISO 3166-1 list, has also been established 
        and delegated.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because the IANA is not in 
        the business of assessing whether or not particular areas are &quot;countries,&quot; 
        the policy set forth in ICP-1 and RFC 1591 for delegation matters has 
        been to avoid political considerations and simply refer to the ISO 3166-1 
        list as an independent source of two-letter abbreviations for countries 
        and areas. The ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency, in determining which countries 
        and areas should be provided codes on the ISO 3166-1 list, looks to two 
        other lists provided by the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/Depts/unsd/methods/m49.htm">United 
        Nations Statistics Division</A>. As <A HREF="http://www.un.org/Depts/unsd/methods/m49alpha.htm">noted</A> 
        by the Statistics Division in connection with its listing of countries 
        and areas: &quot;The designations employed and the presentation of country 
        or area names in this list do not imply the expression of any opinion 
        whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning 
        the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, 
        or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.&quot; Thus, 
        it is well-settled under current delegation policy that issues about the 
        legal status of a listed entry on the ISO 3166-1 list are not pertinent 
        to whether a ccTLD should be established and delegated.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After over two years of deliberations, 
        the United Nations Statistics Division and the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency 
        have determined that a code should be provided for the Occupied Palestinian 
        Territory, and the code .ps code has been added to the ISO 3166-1 list. 
        Thus, a crucial change in circumstances has occurred since this matter 
        first arose in early 1997. Then, although .ps was included as an &quot;exceptional 
        reservation&quot; for possible future inclusion on the ISO 3166-1 code 
        list, it was not actually included on that list. The IANA's policy is 
        to delegate ccTLDs only from the ISO 3166-1 list, so that in 1997 .ps 
        did not meet that requirement for delegation. The ISO 3166-1 list now 
        includes .ps, and accordingly that code now qualifies for delegation as 
        a ccTLD.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(A few of the currently delegated 
        ccTLDs do not appear on the ISO 3166-1 list. The United Kingdom was assigned 
        the <A HREF="http://www.nominet.net/nominet/intro.html">ccTLD .uk</A> 
        in the <A HREF="/root-whois/uk.htm">mid-1980s</A> even though ISO 3166-1 
        calls for use of .gb. This assignment occurred before the IANA began using 
        any standard list of country-code abbreviations. During a brief period 
        in 1996, the IANA followed the policy of delegating ccTLDs not only from 
        the ISO 3166-1 list but also from codes the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency 
        had reserved specifically for purposes of the Universal Postal Union. 
        That policy proved unsatisfactory and was quickly abandoned in favor of 
        strict adherence to the ISO 3166-1 list. Finally, a few ccTLDs that were 
        established from the ISO 3166-1 list were later deleted from that list. 
        An example is the ccTLD for Zaire, .zr.)<BR>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A fundamental principle reflected 
        in ICP-1 is that ccTLDs are intended to be operated for the benefit of 
        the Internet community in the nation or other territory with which the 
        country-code is associated. As Dr Postel wrote in RFC 1591 (and as <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#b">reiterated

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The designated manager is 
          the trustee of the top-level domain for both the nation, in the case 
          of a country code, and the global Internet community. Concerns about 
          &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;ownership&quot; of domains are inappropriate. 
          It is appropriate, however, to be concerned about &quot;responsibilities&quot; 
          and &quot;service&quot; to the community.</font></p>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, in ccTLD-delegation matters, 
        the IANA seeks input from persons concerned or affected by the transfer, 
        particularly those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has 
        been established to benefit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ICP-1 gives the <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">following 
        guidance</A> concerning requirements for delegation of a ccTLD:</font></p>
      <BLOCKQUOTE> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(a) Delegation of a New Top 
          Level Domain. Delegation of a new top level domain requires the completion 
          of a number of procedures, including the identification of a TLD manager 
          with the requisite skills and authority to operate the TLD appropriately. 
          The desires of the government of a country with regard to delegation 
          of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA will make them a major 
          consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions. Significantly 
          interested parties in the domain should agree that the proposed TLD 
          manager is the appropriate party. The key requirement is that for each 
          domain there be a designated manager for supervising that domain's name 
          space. In the case of ccTLDs, this means that there is a manager that 
          supervises the domain names and operates the domain name system in that 
          country. There must be Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to the nameservers 
          and electronic mail connectivity to the entire management, staff, and 
          contacts of the manager. There must be an administrative contact and 
          a technical contact for each domain. The administrative contact must 
          reside in the country involved for ccTLDs. . . .</font></p>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, Drs Qadah and Doleh possess 
        the skills and authority to operate the .ps TLD appropriately. Both are 
        accomplished computer scientists. They have operated the palestine.int 
        domain competently. Dr Qadah is Supervisor-General of the Government Computer 
        Center and has obtained the authority to commit that organization's resources 
        to providing reliable nameservice for the ccTLD. The Palestinian Authority 
        has given its support to his operation of the ccTLD. Dr Qadah and the 
        Government Computer Center have contributed significantly to development 
        of the Internet in Palestine, and their assuming stewardship over the 
        domain should further promote availability and use of the Internet in 
        Palestine. This has earned them support from the Internet community in 
        Palestine, as well as the strong support of the Palestinian Authority.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The IANA is satisfied that 
        Drs Qadah and Doleh recognize the solemn nature of the trust they seek 
        to assume and that they intend to operate the .ps ccTLD in the interest 
        of both the Internet community in Palestine and those throughout the world 
        who are or may in the future be affected by the operation of the .ps TLD. 
        In this regard, the IANA notes that Dr Qadah has indicated that the Government 
        Computer Center and the Palestinian Authority will work with ICANN in 
        accordance with global norms and regulations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The IANA has verified IP connectivity 
        to the proposed nameservers and e-mail connectivity to the contacts. Dr 
        Qadah, the proposed administrative contact, resides in Palestine.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is the IANA's conclusion
