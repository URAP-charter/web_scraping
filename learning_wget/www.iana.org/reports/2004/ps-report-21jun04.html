      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. This report gives the findings 
        and conclusions of the IANA on its investigation of various requests for 
        the redelegation of the .ps (Palestinian Territory, Occupied) country-code 
        top-level domain (ccTLD). </p>



	  <p><b>Factual and Procedural Background</b><br>
        <br>
        In March 2000, IANA approved a request for the establishment of the .ps 
        ccTLD. At that time and today, that two-letter code was and is set forth 
        on the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/index.html">ISO 
        3166-1 list (http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/index.html)</a> 
        maintained by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA) as the approved 
        alpha-2 code for the Palestinian Territory, Occupied).<br>
        <br>
        Upon its establishment in March 2000, the .ps ccTLD was delegated by IANA 
        to the Government Computer Center (GCC) at the Ministry of Planning and 
        International Cooperation with Ghassan Qadah as administrative contact, 
        and Yassir Doleh as the technical contact. Both contacts no longer work 
        with the GCC, and the GCC itself has been transferred from the Ministry 
        of Planning and International Cooperation to the Ministry of Telecommunications 
        and Information Technology.<br>
        <br>
        In January 2004, ICANN received an expression of interest to redelegate 
        the .ps ccTLD to the Government Computer Center at the new Ministry of 
        Telecommunications and Information Technology (MOTIT). The request was 
        supported by the Palestinian Territory Government who, through the Palestinian 
        Territory Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology (MOTIT), 
        recognized GCC as the appropriate delegee for the .ps ccTLD. It expressed 
        an interest to have GCC formally recognized by ICANN as the delegee for 
        the .ps ccTLD according to the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">“Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains” 
        (http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm)</a> 
        issued in February 2000 by ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.” The GCC is part of the MOTIT 
        but includes representatives from the Government, Private sector, academia, 
        law institutions and local internet community in Palestine.<br>
        <br>
        The existing administrative contact has expressed support for the redelegation 
        request, and the listed technical contact has stated that he has no objection.<br>
        <br>
        By the accompanying template, the redelegation request proposed to change 
        the GCC’s sponsoring organization to the Ministry of Telecommunications 
        and Information Technology (MOTIT), the administrative contact to Mr. 
        Yazan Abdelrahman, and the technical contact to Mr. Fadi Ismael.<br>
        <br>
        The proposal specified that the .ps registry would have an oversight committee 
        at GCC consisting of the Government, private sector, and academia, in 
        service to the emerging Palestinian Internet community. <br>
        <br>
        In accord with the proposed arrangements, as described above, the Ministry 
        of telecommunications and Information Technology and the Internet Corporation 
        for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) have agreed on the language of 
        a <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/af/">Memorandum of Understanding 
        (http://www.icann.org/cctlds/af/)</a> providing a framework of accountability 
        under which the GCC at MOTIT would assume the responsibilities as the 
        delegee entrusted with the .ps registry. On April 2004, the ICANN Board 
        of Directors authorized the entry with the Ministry of this Memorandum 
        of Understanding, which closely parallels prior MoUs entered for the <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/bi/">.bi 
        (http://www.icann.org/cctlds/bi/)</a>, <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/la/">.la 
        (http://www.icann.org/cctlds/la/)</a>, and <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/mw/">.mw 
        (http://www.icann.org/cctlds/mw/)</a> ccTLDs.</p>



	  <p><b>Evaluation</b><br>
        <br>
        This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function (http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm)</a> 
        between the United States Government and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN 
        performs the IANA function, which <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm#C.2.1.1.2">includes 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs (http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm#C.2.1.1.2)</a>, 
        investigating the circumstances pertinent to those requests, making its 
        recommendations, and reporting actions undertaken in connection with processing 
        such requests.<br>
        <br>
        In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in “Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation.” 
        (<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1, http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm</a>) 
        ICP-1 represents an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591 (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt which was issued in March 
        1994)</a> dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects subsequent documents and evolution 
        of the policies followed by the IANA through May 1999. Relevant guidance 
        is also provided in the GAC Principles.<br>
        <br>
        In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks input 
        from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly those 
        within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established to 
        benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in ICP-1 
        (http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a)</a>, the parties affected include 
        especially the relevant government or public authority: “The desires of 
        the government of a country with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken 
        very seriously. The IANA will make them a major consideration in any TLD 
        delegation/transfer discussions.”<br>
        <br>
        Based on the materials submitted and the IANA's evaluation of the circumstances, 
        GCC qualifies as an appropriate manager for the .ps registry, with support 
        from the Palestinian Territory Internet community, including the Palestinian 
        Territory Government. As noted above, the government of Palestinian Territory 
        has formally endorsed GCC as the appropriate delegee for the .ps registry.<br>
        <br>
        Mutual agreement of the old and the new delegees is a factor that ICANN 
        takes very seriously when considering redelegation requests. Here, the 
        former administrative and technical contacts both support the change in 
        delegation.<br>
        <br>
        The GAC Principles serve as “best practices” to guide governments in assuming 
        proper roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, which the GAC 
        has observed is “a public resource . . . administered in the public or 
        common interest.” (<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.3">http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.3</a>) 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibility 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system. The GAC Principles recommend that governments and ICANN pursue 
        their respective roles by creating a framework for accountability memorialized 
        in communications with each other and with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2, http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2</a>). 
        The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure their 
        relations with ccTLD managers (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">clauses 
        5.5, http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">clause 
        9, http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9</a>). 
        Among these specific principles, the best practices contemplate that governments 
        will assist in ensuring that the ccTLD manager complies with ICANN polices 
        related to global coordination of the Internet DNS (<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7">clauses 
        9.1.7 and 9.1.8, http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7</a>).<br>
        <br>
        GCC has committed itself to abiding by the GAC Principles in a 12 January 
        2004 communication from the Palestinian Territory Government and the MOTIT, 
        to IANA. In the 12 January letter, the Government of the Palestinian Territory 
        has followed the actions of the Governments of <a href="http://www.iana.org/reports/pw-report-30jun03.htm#fn1">Australia 
        (http://www.iana.org/reports/pw-report-30jun03.htm#fn1)</a>, <a href="http://www.iana.org/reports/pw-report-30jun03.htm#fn2">Japan 
        (http://www.iana.org/reports/pw-report-30jun03.htm#fn2)</a>, <a href="http://www.iana.org/reports/pw-report-30jun03.htm#fn3">Kenya 
        (http://www.iana.org/reports/pw-report-30jun03.htm#fn3)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.iana.org/reports/pw-report-30jun03.htm#fn4">Sudan 
        (http://www.iana.org/reports/pw-report-30jun03.htm#fn4)</a> in committing 
        to the principles of non profit regulation of the type that have allowed 
        and will continue to allow the Internet globally to flourish, while providing 
        the Government with the ability to intervene should the non profit entity 
        be unable to fulfill this function.<br>
        <br>
        The proposed delegation will promote service to the local Internet community 
        and will help assure continued Internet interoperability through the global 
        technical coordination that ICANN was created to provide. In this regard, 
        the recognition by the Palestinian Territory Government's discussion of 
        the need for close coordination between ICANN and the government is particularly 
        noteworthy.<br>
        <br>
        According to the relevant communications, GCC is well-suited to be inclusive 
        of, and accountable to, the Palestinian Territory Internet community and 
        to operate through appropriate open, transparent, and inclusive processes. 
      </p>



<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>



      <p>The structure proposed by GCC and endorsed by the Palestinian Territory 
        Government is to have GCC undertake management of the .ps ccTLD under 
        appropriate oversight of the Palestinian Territory Government concerning 
        the national policy interests. GCC and the Palestinian Territory Government 
        also acknowledge and support ICANN's responsibility for coordinating management 
        of the DNS, including the .ps ccTLD, to safeguard global technical-coordination 
        interests. In reviewing the request, in light of the Palestinian Territory 
        Government's endorsement of GCC as the appropriate all inclusive manager, 
        and in view of achievement of agreements documenting the framework of 
        accountability described above; the IANA concludes that the .ps ccTLD 
        should be redelegated to GCC.</p>
