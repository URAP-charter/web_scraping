      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. This report gives the findings 
        and conclusions of the IANA on its investigation of various requests for 
        redelegation of the .ng (Nigeria) country-code top-level domain (ccTLD).</p>



	  <p><b>Factual and Procedural Background</b><br>
        <br>
        In 1995, the University of Southern California's Information Sciences 
        Institute (which then performed the IANA functions) approved a request 
        for establishment of the .ng ccTLD. At that time and today, that two-letter 
        code was and is set forth on the ISO 3166-1 list maintained by the ISO 
        3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA) as the approved alpha-2 code for 
        Nigeria.<br>
        <br>
        Upon its establishment on 15 March 1995, the .ng ccTLD was delegated by 
        Dr. Jon Postel (then in charge of the IANA function at the Information 
        Sciences Institute) to Ms. Iyabo Odusote from Yaba College of Technology, 
        Lagos, Nigeria as administrative contact; and Mr. Abraham Gebrehewit, 
        from IAT, Pisa, Italy, as the technical contact. <br>
        <br>
        In March 1998, IANA received two expressions of interest to redelegate 
        the .ng ccTLD to Nigeria Telecommunications Limited, PTT (NITEL) but also 
        to Nigeria Internet Group (NIG). Because those requests happened before 
        the formation of ICANN, the records regarding them are not available to 
        the ICANN staff. Moreover, these requests were not pursued further by 
        the parties involved, and therefore ICANN has taken no action regarding 
        them. <br>
        <br>
        In the Nigerian National Policy for Information Technology (IT) dated 
        March 2001, approved by the Federal Executive Council in March 2001, in 
        Chapter 3: Governance, under 3.3 strategies – it says “(ix) safeguarding 
        the effective use of the dot NG (.ng) Domain name for Nigeria, with NITDA 
        as the operating agency.” Following the approval of the National IT Policy 
        by the Federal Executive Council, NITDA was established. NITDA's mandate 
        is diverse and vast, but all their responsibilities fall under the aegis 
        of fostering the development and growth of IT in Nigeria. In an effort 
        towards ensuring that the policy's implementation proceeds with maximum 
        effectiveness, NITDA will regulate, monitor, evaluate, and verify progress 
        on an ongoing basis under the supervision and coordination of the Federal 
        Ministry of Science and Technology. <br>
        <br>
        In a message dated 8 December 2003, the Nigerian Government, through the 
        Federal Ministry of Science and Technology recognized The National IT 
        Development Agency (NITDA) as the appropriate delegee for the .ng ccTLD 
        and expressed an interest to have NITDA formally recognized by ICANN as 
        the delegee for the .ng ccTLD. <br>
        <br>
        Mrs. Ibukun Odusote, the existing Administrative Contact, has expressed 
        support for the redelegation request. Mr. Randy Bush, who became the Technical 
        Contact on 30 July 2001, has also expressed his support for the redelegation.<br>
        <br>
        To clarify and document the relative roles and responsibilities of NITDA, 
        the Government of Nigeria, and ICANN; representatives of the parties have 
        drafted the bilateral communications between each pair of the three parties. 
        A NITDA-ICANN Agreement was entered in April 2004. The Nigerian Government 
        has also sent ICANN communications recognizing ICANN's role in coordinating 
        the DNS to preserve global interoperability. In December 2003, NITDA expressed 
        its desire to execute the appropriate MOU with ICANN, and on April 2004 
        the ICANN Board authorized the entry of such an agreement with NITDA.</p>



	  <p><b>Evaluation</b><br>
        <br>
        This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm#C.2.1.1.2">includes 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs</a>, 
        investigating the circumstances pertinent to those requests, making its 
        recommendations, and reporting actions undertaken in connection with processing 
        such requests.<br>
        <br>
        In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; 
        (<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1</a>). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</a> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects 
        subsequent documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA 
        through May 1999. Relevant guidance is also provided in the GAC Principles.<br>
        <br>
        In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks input 
        from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly those 
        within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established to 
        benefit. As noted in <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">ICP-1</a>, 
        the parties affected include especially the relevant government or public 
        authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country with regard 
        to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA will make 
        them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot; 
        <br>
        <br>
        Based on the materials submitted and the IANA's evaluation of the circumstances, 
        NITDA qualifies as an appropriate manager for the .ng registry. It has 
        the support of both the Nigerian Internet community, and the Nigerian 
        Government. As noted above, the government of Nigeria through the Federal 
        Ministry for Science and Technology has formally endorsed NITDA as the 
        appropriate delegee for the .ng registry.<br>
        <br>
        Mutual agreement of the old and the new delegees is a factor that ICANN 
        takes very seriously when considering redelegation requests. Here, the 
        former administrative contact supports the change in delegation and the 
        technical contact has stated that they have no objection.<br>
        <br>
        The GAC Principles serve as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments 
        in assuming proper roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, 
        which the GAC has observed is “<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.3">a 
        public resource . . . administered in the public or common interest</a>”. 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibility 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system. The GAC Principles recommend that governments and ICANN pursue 
        their respective roles by creating a framework for accountability memorialized 
        in communications with each other and with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">clauses 
        5.5</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">clause 
        9</a>). Among these specific principles, the best practices contemplate 
        that governments will assist in ensuring that the ccTLD manager complies 
        with ICANN polices related to global coordination of the Internet DNS 
        (<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7">clauses 
        9.1.7 and 9.1.8</a>).<br>
        <br>
        By migrating the delegation of the .ng ccTLD to a more formal, legally 
        enforceable set of arrangements between a delegee organization, the relevant 
        government, and ICANN (which performs the IANA function) the proposed 
        delegation will promote service to the local Internet community and will 
        help assure continued Internet interoperability through the global technical 
        coordination that ICANN was created to provide. <br>
        <br>
        According to the relevant communications, NITDA is well-suited to be inclusive 
        of, and accountable to, the Nigerian Internet community; and to operate 
        through appropriate open, transparent, and inclusive processes.</p>



<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>



      <p>The structure proposed by NITDA and endorsed by the Nigerian Government is 
        to have NITDA undertake management of the .ng ccTLD under appropriate 
        oversight of the Nigerian Government concerning the national policy interests. 
        NITDA and the Nigerian Government also acknowledge and support ICANN's 
        responsibility for coordinating management of the DNS, including the .ng 
        ccTLD, to safeguard global technical coordination interests. In reviewing 
        the request, in light of the Nigerian Government's endorsement of NITDA 
        as the appropriate manager, and in view of achievement of agreements documenting 
        the framework of accountability described above; the IANA concludes that 
        the .ng ccTLD should be redelegated to NITDA.</p>
