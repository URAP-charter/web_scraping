      <p>In December of 2003 the Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC) 
        <a href="http://www.rssac.org/rssac-v6tldglue.html">made a recommendation to 
        the ICANN board</a> regarding adding IPv6 name server addresses to the 
        root zone for Top Level Domains (TLDs) that request them. The recommendation 
        also suggested that the IANA adopt certain procedures to deal with potential 
        (although unlikely) problems that may occur as a result of these changes. 
      </p>
      <p>In response to this recommendation, and as part of IANA&#8217;s ongoing 
        commitment to document procedures related to its areas of responsibility, 
        <a href="delegation-data.html">the following draft is offered for consideration 
        and comment</a> by interested members of the community. It describes procedures 
        in use currently <strong>(<a href="delegation-data.html#ChangeRequest">IANA 
        Procedures for Processing Name Server Change Requests</a>)</strong>, procedures 
        designed specifically to implement the recommendations of the RSSAC <strong>(<a href="delegation-data.html#RemovalOrder">IANA 
        Procedures for Delegation Data Removal Order</a>)</strong>, and procedures 
        for other, related issues of root zone management <strong>(<a href="delegation-data.html#RemoveProblematic">IANA 
        Procedures for Removing Problematic Delegation Data</a>)</strong>.</p>
      <p>If you would like to offer a comment about the draft, the public comment 
        email address is <a href="mailto:iana-del-data-comments@icann.org">iana-del-data-comments@icann.org</a>. 
        You can view previously posted comments at <a href="http://forum.icann.org/lists/iana-del-data-comments/">http://forum.icann.org/lists/iana-del-data-comments/</a>.</p>
      <p>The public comment period for this document will be open until 21 June 
        2004. Comments will be reviewed, and a final version of the procedure 
        will be posted on 28 June. Unless there are significant operational considerations 
        at the root zone level that will prevent implementation, the first of 
        the IPv6 glue records will be added to the root zone on 28 June.</p>
