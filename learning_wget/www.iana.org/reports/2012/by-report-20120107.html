	<h1>Redelegation of the .BY domain representing Belarus to Reliable Software Inc.</h1>
<p>
	ICANN has received a request to redelegate the .BY domain, a country-code top-level domain representing Belarus, to Reliable Software Inc. ICANN Staff have assessed the request, and provide this report for the ICANN Board of Directors to consider.
</p>
<h2>
	Factual Information
</h2>
<h3>
	Country
</h3>
<p>The "BY" ISO 3166-1 code is designated for use to represent Belarus.</p>
<h3>
	Chronology of events
</h3>
<p>The .BY domain was first delegated in 1994. The most recent successful application of the redelegation procedure was conducted in 2009, resulting in the sponsoring organisation <a href="http://www.iana.org/reports/2009/by-report-03feb2009.html">being designated</a> as Open Contact Ltd.
In February 2010, the President of the Republic of Belarus issued Decree No. 60 “On the Measures to Improve the Use of the National Segment of the Internet”, in which the Operative Analytical Centre (OAC) is designated as the authorised government body for the purposes of security of the Internet, and representing the country with respect to such issues. Further, Decree No. 515 “On Some Measures to Develop the Data Transfer Networks” was issued on 30 September 2010 appointing the Operative Analytical Centre as the independent regulator of information and communication technologies.</p>
<p>In June 2010, OAC issued an order with governing provisions for many aspects of how the .BY top-level domain is to be operated. It includes a provisioning that “the technical administrator shall be determined by [OAC] according to the results of [a competition]”. Between August and October 2010, OAC conducted the competition process for operation of the .BY top-level domain. Four organisations took part in the contest, resulting in the selection of Reliable Software Inc. as the winning bidder. 
<p>In early 2011, Reliable Software Inc. and OAC approached ICANN concerning the future redelegation of the .BY domain.</p>
<p>On 8 November 2011, Reliable Software Inc. commenced a request to ICANN for redelegation of the “.BY” top-level domain.</p>
</p>

</p>
<h3>
	Proposed Sponsoring Organisation and Contacts
</h3>
	<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation is Reliable Software Inc., a company (registration number 100160363) established in 1992 in Belarus. It is located at 1A Khoruzhey Str., Minsk, Belarus.</p>
	<p>The proposed administrative contact is Sergey Prokopov, the Head of Department of the Operative Analytical Center of the Republic of Belarus. The administrative contact is understood to be based in Belarus.</p>
	<p>The proposed technical contact is Yury Zisser, the Director General of Reliable Software Inc.</p>
<h2>
	Evaluation of the Request
</h2>
<h3>
	String Eligibility
</h3>
<p>The top-level domain is eligible for continued delegation under ICANN policy, as it is the assigned ISO 3166-1 two-letter code representing Belarus.</p>
<h3>
	Public Interest
</h3>
<p>Support for the application to delegate the domain was provided by Sergey Prokopov, the Head of Department of the Operative Analytical Center of Belarus, the government entity entrusted with regulatory powers concerning the .BY top-level domain.</p>
	<p>Support for the redelegation has also been provided by Belinfocom Association, Business Network Ltd., Extmedia LLC, Aktivnie Technologii Ltd., and Open Contact Ltd.</p>
	<p>The application is consistent with known applicable local laws in Belarus.</p>
	<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation undertakes to operate the domain in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
<h3>
	Based in country
</h3>
<p>
	The proposed sponsoring organisation is constituted in Belarus. The proposed administrative contact is understood to be resident in Belarus. The registry is to be operated in the country.
</p>
<h3>
	Stability
</h3>
<p>
	The request is deemed uncontested, with the current sponsoring organisation consenting to the transfer. An appropriate transfer plan has been tendered with support from the involved parties.
	
</p>
<h3>
	Competency
</h3>
<p>
	The application has provided satisfactory details on the technical and operational infrastructure and expertise that will be used to operate the proposed new domain. Proposed policies for management of the domain have also been tendered.
</p>

<h2>
	Evaluation Procedure
</h2>
<p>
	The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is tasked with managing the Domain Name System root zone as part of a set of functions governed by a contract with the U.S. Government. This includes managing the delegations of top-level domains.
</p>
<p>
	A subset of top-level domains are designated for the local Internet communities in countries to operate in a way that best suits their local needs. These are known as country-code top-level domains, and are assigned by ICANN to responsible trustees (known as “Sponsoring Organisations”) who meet a number of public-interest criteria for eligibility. These criteria largely relate to the level of support the trustee has from their local Internet community, their capacity to ensure stable operation of the domain, and their applicability under any relevant local laws.
</p>
<p>
	Through an ICANN department known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), requests are received for delegating new country-code top-level domains, and redelegating or revoking existing country-code top-level domains. An investigation is performed on the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and, when appropriate, the requests are implemented. Decisions on whether to implement requests are made by the ICANN Board of Directors, taking into account ICANN’s core mission of ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems.
</p>
<h3>
	Purpose of evaluations
</h3>
<p>
	The evaluation of eligibility for country-code top-level domains, and of evaluating responsible trustees charged with operating them, is guided by a number of principles. The objective of the assessment is that the action enhances the secure and stable operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems. The evolution of the principles has been documented in “Domain Name System Structure and Delegation” (RFC 1591), “Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation” (ICP-1), and other informational memoranda.
</p>
<p>
	In considering requests to delegate or redelegate country-code top-level domains, input is sought regarding the proposed new Sponsoring Organisation, as well as from persons and organisations that may be significantly affected by the change, particularly those within the nation or territory to which the ccTLD is designated.
</p>
<p>
	The assessment is focussed on the capacity for the proposed sponsoring organisation to meet the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The domain should be operated within the country, including having its sponsoring organisation and administrative contact based in the country.
	</li>
	<li>The domain should be operated in a way that is fair and equitable to all groups in the local Internet community.
	</li>
	<li>Significantly interested parties in the domain should agree that the prospective trustee is the appropriate party to be responsible for the domain, with the desires of the national government taken very seriously.
	</li>
	<li>The domain must be operated competently, both technically and operationally. Management of the domain should adhere to relevant technical standards and community best practices.
	</li>
	<li>Risks to the stability of the Internet addressing system must be adequately considered and addressed, particularly with regard to how existing identifiers will continue to function.
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Method of evaluation
</h3>
<p>
	To assess these criteria, information is requested from the applicant regarding the proposed sponsoring organisation and method of operation. In summary, a request template is sought specifying the exact details of the delegation being sought in the root zone. In addition, various documentation is sought describing: the views of the local internet community on the application; the competencies and skills of the trustee to operate the domain; the legal authenticity, status and character of the proposed trustee; and the nature of government support fort he proposal. The view of any current trustee is obtained, and in the event of a redelegation, the transfer plan from the previous sponsoring organisation to the new sponsoring organisation is also assessed with a view to ensuring ongoing stable operation of the domain.
</p>
<p>
	After receiving this documentation and input, it is analysed in relation to existing root zone management procedures, seeking input from parties both related to as well as independent of the proposed sponsoring organisation should the information provided in the original application be deficient. The applicant is given the opportunity to cure any deficiencies before a final assessment is made.
</p>
<p>
	Once all the documentation has been received, various technical checks are performed on the proposed sponsoring organisation’s DNS infrastructure to ensure name servers are properly configured and are able to respond to queries for the top-level domain being requested. Should any anomalies be detected, ICANN staff will work with the applicant to address the issues.
</p>
<p>
	Assuming all issues are resolved, an assessment is compiled providing all relevant details regarding the proposed sponsoring organisation and its suitability to operate the top-level domain being requested. This assessment is submitted to ICANN’s Board of Directors for its determination on whether to proceed with the request.
