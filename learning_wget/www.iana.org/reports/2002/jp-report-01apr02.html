      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. </p>
      <p><b><a name="Background"></a>Background</b></p>
      <p>On 8 February 2002, the IANA issued a <a href="/reports/jp-report-08feb02.htm">report</a> 
        on a Request of Japan Registry Service Co., Ltd. (JPRS) for the Redelegation 
        of .jp Top -Level Domain. In this report, the IANA concluded that</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The structure proposed by JPRS and endorsed by JPNIC and the Japanese 
          Government is to have JPRS undertake management of the .jp ccTLD under 
          appropriate oversight of the Japanese Government, with the assistance 
          of JPNIC, concerning national public-policy interests. JPRS, JPNIC, 
          and the Japanese Government also acknowledge and support ICANN's responsibility 
          for coordinating management of the DNS, including the .jp ccTLD, to 
          safeguard global technical-coordination interests. This structure is 
          consonant with the principle of private-sector responsibility for technical 
          coordination under which the Internet has flourished. In reviewing the 
          request and in light of the Japanese Government's endorsement of JPRS 
          as the appropriate private-sector manager, the IANA concludes that, 
          provided JPRS's commitment to these responsibilities is effectively 
          ensured, JPRS is the appropriate delegee of the .jp ccTLD.</p>
        <p>One mechanism to reflect these commitments is the arrangement embodied 
          in the GAC Principles. Where the relevant government (here with the 
          assistance of JPNIC, a public-service ogranization under its jurisdiction) 
          is prepared to carry out the ultimate responsibility for overseeing 
          the ccTLD manager's service to the local Internet community and the 
          manager is prepared to conduct itself within that framework, the interests 
          of the local and global Internet communities are served by ICANN joining 
          into that cooperative arrangement. </p>
        <p>Two of the three parts of that arrangement &#150; the delegee/Government 
          and Government/ICANN communications &#150; have already been implemented. 
          Upon conclusion of a mutually satisfactory agreement between ICANN and 
          JPRS reflecting the principles set forth in <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#10">clause 
          10 of the GAC Principles</a>, adjusted as necessary to suit local circumstances, 
          the .jp ccTLD should be redelgated to JPRS. Once such an agreement is 
          entered, the U.S. Department of Commerce should establish revised procedures 
          for maintenance of the .jp entry in the root zone file that enable ICANN 
          to perform its obligations under that agreement, and that permit moving 
          forward responsibly with the transition to private-sector technical 
          management of the Internet.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>On 12 February 2002, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-12feb02.htm#ApprovalofjpccTLDSponorshipAgreement">ICANN 
        Board authorized</a> the ICANN President to enter on behalf of ICANN the 
        ccTLD Sponsorship Agreement for .jp with JPRS as posted on the ICANN website, 
        along with any minor corrections or adjustments as appropriate.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> 
        The Board also authorized, upon signature of the agreement, the President 
        to take such actions as appropriate to implement the agreement.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> 
        On 27 February 2002, the signature of the <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/jp/">JPRS-ICANN 
        agreement</a> was completed.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>With the achievement of this agreement, the necessary framework of accountability 
        has been achieved, consistent with clause 10 of the GAC Principles concerning 
        accountability of ICANN and ccTLD trustees. Accordingly, the IANA concludes 
        that the redelegation request should now go forward.</p>
