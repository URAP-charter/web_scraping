      <p align="left">The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part 
        of the administrative functions associated with management of the domain-name 
        system root, is responsible for receiving requests for delegation and 
        redelegation of top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent 
        to those requests, and reporting on the requests. In March 2002, the IANA 
        received a preliminary request for redelegation of the .sd (Sudan) country-code 
        top-level domain (ccTLD). This report gives the findings and conclusions 
        of the IANA on its investigation of that request.</p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></p>
      <p>The .sd ccTLD registry was first delegated by the IANA in March 1997 
        to Mr. Ihab I. Osman of Sudan OnLine, Inc., Khartoum, as administrative 
        and technical contact. </p>
      <p>Mr. Osman was initially able to establish a functional registry, but 
        the combined pressures of Sudan's civil war, political instabilities, 
        and international sanctions made its ongoing operation impossible. By 
        mid-2001, the .sd registry was essentially dead&nbsp;&#150; no new zone files were 
        being generated, and neither the primary nor secondary nameservers were 
        responding to queries.</p>
      <p>In 2001, the IANA was contacted by several parties interested in pursuing 
        redelegation of the .sd ccTLD registry. However, most of these parties 
        were located outside Sudan, and, upon investigation, none appeared to 
        have any meaningful support from the local Internet community, and none 
        had the concurrence of the current delegated manager, Mr. Osman.</p>
      <p>In February 2002, the IANA was contacted by Mr. Yassir Hassan Elamin, 
        President of Sudan Internet Society<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> and 
        an employee of Sudatel, the Sudan Telecom Company. Mr. Elamin had been 
        working to develop a ccTLD management plan, and gathering local Internet 
        community support, and the support of the Sudanese Government, for a broadly-supported 
        redelegation with the consent of the existing manager. After a series 
        of exchanges regarding IANA policies for redelegation, Mr. Elamin submitted 
        to the IANA a preliminary request for redelegation on 20 March 2002. The 
        redelegation proposal was incomplete in certain respects, and, through 
        a series of exchanges over the following months, the IANA requested and 
        obtained additional information on the Sudan Internet Society's technical 
        plans and capabilities. The IANA's consultations with academic and other 
        members of the Sudan Internet community indicated the existence of solid 
        support for Sudan Internet Society and its redelegation initiative.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the IANA requested the views and response of the current 
        delegated manager, Mr. Osman. On 12 July 2002, Mr. Osman communicated 
        to the IANA his position on the proposed redelegation: &quot;I fully support 
        the Sudanese Internet Society (SIS) to become the new registry for .sd 
        ccTLD. The SIS is technically qualified and I believe they have the right 
        systems and processes in place to manage the .sd ccTLD.&quot; He further 
        expressed his commitment to assist in a smooth transition.</p>
      <p>As to its technical capabilities, Sudan Internet Society has made fully 
        adequate provisions for connectivity, DNS nameservers, a management system, 
        and other necessary arrangements. Significantly, through its membership, 
        Sudan Internet Society has access to a broad range of technical talent, 
        including technical staff and systems administrators at ISPs, the national 
        telecom operator, and several universities.</p>
      <p>On 6 October 2002, a final version of the formal redelegation template 
        was submitted to the IANA by Mr. Elamin. In a <a href="/cctld/sd/elkhateeb-to-lynn-15oct02.htm">letter 
        dated 15 October 2002</a>, the Minister of Information and Communications 
        of the Republic of the Sudan communicated to the IANA the Sudanese government's 
        endorsement of Sudan Internet Society as the appropriate holder of the 
        delegation for the .sd registry. The letter further attached an exchange 
        of letters between the Ministry and Sudan Internet Society, which together 
        specified in detail the arrangements by which the Sudanese government 
        and Sudan Internet Society would fulfill their respective roles and responsibilities 
        to assure that the .sd registry is operated in the interests of the Sudan 
        Internet community.</p>
      <p>The Sudan Internet Society and the Internet Corporation for Assigned 
        Names and Numbers (ICANN) have agreed on language for a Sponsorship Agreement 
        under which the Sudan Internet Society would assume the responsibility 
        of as sponsoring organization/delegee of the .sd ccTLD. On 18 November 
        2002, the ICANN Board of Directors <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-18nov02.htm#ccTLDAgreementforsd">authorized 
        ICANN</a> to enter this Sponsorship Agreement, which closely parallels 
        the <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/model-tscsa-31jan02.htm">model 
        Sponsorship Agreement</a> ICANN has developed for triangular relationships 
        among ICANN, private-sector sponsoring organizations, and the relevant 
        national governments.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm#sow2.1.1.2">includes</a> 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs, investigating 
        the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">Internet 
        Domain Name System Structure and Delegation</a>&quot; (ICP-1). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC&nbsp;1591</a> 
        (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects subsequent 
        documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA through May 
        1999.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot;</p>
      <p>Based on the materials submitted and the IANA’s evaluation of the circumstances, 
        the Sudan Internet Society appears to be an appropriate and technically 
        competent manager for the .sd registry, with broad support from the Sudan 
        Internet community, including the Sudanese government. As noted above, 
        the government of the Republic of the Sudan has formally endorsed the 
        Sudan Internet Society as the appropriate delegee for the .sd registry. 
        Additional endorsements gathered in the IANA's investigation also demonstrate 
        that the Sudan Internet Society enjoys broad support among non-governmental 
        participants in the Sudan Internet community.</p>
      <p>Mutual agreement of the old and new delegees is also a significant factor 
        favoring a redelegation. Here, both present delegee (Ihab I. Osman) as 
        well as the proposed new delegee (the Sudan Internet Society) favor the 
        change in delegation.</p>
      <p>As part of its redelegation request, Sudan Internet Society provided 
        the IANA with a copy of its intended registration policies. The IANA has 
        reviewed those policies and found them to be consistent with ICP-1 and 
        RFC 1591. The Sudan Internet Society’s technical plans and resources are 
        adequate to the likely needs of the .sd ccTLD.</p>
      <p>In February 2000, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/">ICANN 
        Governmental Advisory Committee</a> (GAC) issued a document entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>,&quot; 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot; These principles serve 
        as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments in assuming proper 
        roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, which the GAC has 
        observed is a public resource to be administered in the public interest. 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibility 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system. The GAC Principles recommend that governments and ICANN pursue 
        their respective roles by creating a framework for accountability memorialized 
        in communications with each other and with the ccTLD manager (see clause 
        2). The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see clauses 5.5 and 9). Among these 
        specific principles, the best practices contemplate that governments will 
        assist in ensuring that the ccTLD manager complies with ICANN polices 
        related to global coordination of the Internet DNS (clauses 9.1.7 and 
        9.1.8).</p>
      <p>SIS has committed itself to abiding by the GAC principles, and its responsibilities 
        under clause 9, as confirmed in a <a href="/cctld/sd/elamin-to-elkhateeb-09oct02.htm">9 
        October 2002 communication</a> from the Sudan Internet Society (SIS) to 
        the Secretary General of the Ministry of Information and Communication 
        of the Government of the Republic of the Sudan. This reaffirms that SIS 
        is committed to carrying out its responsibilities for ensuring the interests 
        of the local Internet community are being served.</p>
      <p>In the case of the .sd ccTLD, the Minister of Information and Communications 
        has assumed, on behalf of his Ministry, these responsibilities within 
        a framework of accountability, openness, and service to the local Internet 
        community. In a letter from the Minister to ICANN, the Government of the 
        Republic of the Sudan has committed to private-sector management of the 
        .sd ccTLD while providing the Government with the ability to intervene 
        should the private sector be unable to fulfill this function. The letter 
        also recognizes the desirability of private-sector technical coordination 
        of the Internet on a global scale, and affirms that the Sudan Government 
        is committed to ICANN and “considers ICANN to be the appropriate international 
        entity to oversee the technical coordination of the Internet in a manner 
        that will preserve it as an effective and convenient mechanism for global 
        communication and commerce.&quot;</p>
      <p>According to the design described in its constitution, and the relevant 
        communications, SIS is well-suited to be inclusive of, and accountable 
        to, the Sudan Internet community and to operate through appropriate open, 
        transparent, and inclusive processes.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The structure proposed by the Sudan Internet Society and endorsed by 
        the Sudanese Government is to have the Sudan Internet Society undertake 
        management of the .sd ccTLD under appropriate oversight of the Sudanese 
        Government (concerning national public-policy interests) and ICANN (concerning 
        global technical-coordination interests). This structure is consonant 
        with the principle of private-sector responsibility for technical coordination 
        under which the Internet has flourished. In reviewing the request and 
        in light of (a) the Sudanese Government's endorsement of the Sudan Internet 
        Society as the appropriate private-sector manager and (b) the Sudan Internet 
        Society’s willingness to enter a sponsorship agreement embodying an appropriate 
        framework of accountability, the IANA concludes that the Sudan Internet 
        Society is the appropriate delegee of the .sd ccTLD.</p>
      <p>One mechanism to reflect an appropriate framework of accountability is 
        the arrangement embodied in the GAC Principles. Where, as here, the relevant 
        government is prepared to carry out the ultimate responsibility for overseeing 
        the ccTLD manager's service to the local Internet community and the manager 
        is prepared to conduct itself within that framework, the interests of 
        the local and global Internet communities are served by ICANN joining 
        into that cooperative arrangement.</p>
      <p>Two of the three parts of that arrangement–the Sudan Internet Society/Government 
        and Government/ICANN communications–have already been implemented. Upon 
        signing of the ICANN/Sudan Internet Society sponsorship agreement, which 
        reflects the principles set forth in clause 10 of the GAC principles, 
        adjusted as necessary to suit local circumstances, the .sd ccTLD should 
        be redelgated to Sudan Internet Society.</p>
