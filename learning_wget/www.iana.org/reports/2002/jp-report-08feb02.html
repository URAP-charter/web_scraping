      <p align="left">The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part 
        of the administrative functions associated with management of the domain-name 
        system root, is responsible for receiving requests for delegation and 
        redelegation of top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent 
        to those requests, and reporting on the requests. On 3 December 2001, 
        the IANA received a <a href="/cctld/jp/redelegation-request-03dec01.htm">request 
        for redelegation of the .jp (Japan) country-code top-level domain</a> 
        (ccTLD). This report gives the findings and conclusions of the IANA on 
        its investigation of that request. </p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></p>
      <p>In August 1986, the University of Southern California's <a href="http://www.isi.edu/">Information 
        Sciences Institute</a> (which then performed the IANA functions) approved 
        a request for establishment of the .jp ccTLD. At that time and today, 
        that two-letter code was and is set forth on the <a href="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">ISO 
        3166-1 list</a> maintained by the <a href="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html">ISO 
        3166 Maintenance Agency</a> (ISO 3166/MA) as the approved alpha-2 code 
        for Japan.</p>
      <p>Japan has a <a href="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ja.html">population 
        of approximately 125,000,000</a> and consists of a chain of islands between 
        the North Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan. The country consists of 
        forty-seven prefectures and has the world's third largest economy.</p>
      <p>Japan was an early participant in the Internet. JUNET (Japanese University 
        Network) was established in 1984 to interconnect Japanese universities, 
        and in 1985, when telecommunications regulations were liberalized, network 
        connectivity tests began. In 1986, JUNET became connected with CSNET and 
        USENET. Jun Murai was the key person during this process, taking on the 
        responsibilities entailed in sorting out activities required, both in 
        Japan and the United States, to promote Japanese Internet access and usage.</p>
      <p>On 5 August 1986, soon after deployment of the current domain-name system 
        in 1984 and 1985 (see <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc921.txt">RFC 
        921</a>), the .jp ccTLD was delegated by Dr. Jon Postel (then in charge 
        of the IANA function at the Information Sciences Institute) to Jun Murai. 
        It was created, in a sense, as a test case of domain names to be assigned 
        to countries and geographical regions. At that time, it was Dr. Postel's 
        standard practice for authority and responsibilities regarding ccTLDs 
        to be delegated to trusted individuals.</p>
      <p>Jun Murai began at first to manage and administer the .jp ccTLD from 
        within the &quot;junet-admin&quot; group, which was responsible for the 
        operation of JUNET. Initially, JUNET had been using the top-level domain 
        name &quot;.junet,&quot; but it was suggested by Jun Murai that the Japanese 
        Internet community should instead use .jp, as international rules concerning 
        top-level domains were being established. In April 1989, junet-admin began 
        registration of .jp domain names. Transfer from .junet to .jp was completed 
        in approximately three months, and .junet domain names were replaced with 
        such domains as .ac.jp and .co.jp.</p>
      <p>Due to accelerating Internet development, the capability for voluntary 
        administration of Internet resources, such as domain name registration 
        and IP address assignment services, approached impracticality, and it 
        became difficult to quickly respond to the needs of the Internet users 
        in Japan. After extensive discussion among various Japanese academic societies 
        the JCRN (Japan Committee for Research Networks) was established, which 
        made the decision to create JNIC (Japan Network Information Center) in 
        December 1991 to provide an institutional framework for the management 
        and administration of the .jp ccTLD. </p>
      <p>In April 1993, with Jun Murai's consent, JNIC reorganized itself as <a href="http://www.nic.ad.jp/">JPNIC</a> 
        (JaPan Network Information Center), members of which were ISPs, research 
        networks, and academic networks located in Japan. With this reorganization, 
        JPNIC became financially more stable by operating with a membership-fee 
        system, providing a foundation that would allow more responsible operations. 
        In order to promote fair and transparent decision making for the benefit, 
        JPNIC created a Steering Committee and working groups, and actively called 
        for public comments based on a policy of information disclosure. Also, 
        a system was put into place in which the consensus of the members was 
        reflected in the development of major policies, and in which final decisions 
        would be made at the General Meetings.</p>
      <p>With increasing governmental interest, JPNIC detailed its objectives 
        to the Government of Japan, and on 31 March 1997, it obtained permits 
        from the Science and Technology Agency; the Ministry of Education, Science, 
        Sports and Culture; the Ministry of International Trade and Industry; 
        and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (presently, the <a href="http://www.mext.go.jp/english/index.htm">Ministry 
        of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</a>; the <a href="http://www.meti.go.jp/english/index.html">Ministry 
        of Economy, Trade and Industry</a>; and <a href="http://www.soumu.go.jp/english/index.htm">Ministry 
        of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications</a>) 
        to operate as a non-profit corporate association. JPNIC continues to operate 
        in that status under the supervision of the ministries.</p>
      <p>JPNIC has conducted, for the benefit of the Internet community, various 
        activities such as international coordination, information services, sponsoring 
        of an annual &quot;Internet Week&quot; event for education and outreach, 
        and development of the <a href="http://www.nic.ad.jp/en/regist/dom/drp/index.html">JP-DRP</a> 
        (.jp Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy). Also, JPNIC has in recent 
        years progressively conducted technical research on internationalized 
        domain names. As a result of these efforts, the number of .jp domain names 
        exceeded 100,000 in September 1999, and 200,000 in September 2000. </p>
      <p>This growth in the number of .jp domain names, as well as the dramatic 
        growth in the number of Internet users in Japan, presented challenges 
        for JPNIC. In order to maintain efficient use of domain name space and 
        prevent disputes relating to domain names, JPNIC had initiated a &quot;one 
        domain name per organization&quot; policy. However, as the Internet grew 
        and use of it increased, Internet users in Japan began to demand more 
        than one domain name per organization. Beginning around 1999, moreover, 
        competition of domain name registration between .jp and gTLDs such as 
        .com became significant in Japan. Under these circumstances, in order 
        to satisfy users' needs, JPNIC began to study the possibility of introducing 
        a &quot;general-use .jp domain name&quot; space, in which more than one 
        domain name per organization could be registered, in addition to the existing 
        one-domain-name-per-organization space. In the second half of 2000, establishment 
        and enforcement of the JP-DRP (.jp Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy) 
        set forth a dispute-resolution procedure and created an environment into 
        which the general-use .jp domain name could be introduced.</p>
      <p>Upon introduction of the general-use .jp domain name, it was important 
        that registration services began as promptly as possible, so as to meet 
        the needs of Internet users in as timely a manner as possible. Also, as 
        it was expected that the number of registrations for the general-use .jp 
        domain name would soar, it was necessary that the registration system 
        and service of the .jp domain in general be more stable, to be able to 
        endure rapid and drastic change, and fluctuations in registration demand.</p>
      <p>Additionally, under government guidelines that regulate public service 
        organizations in Japan, it was not appropriate for JPNIC, as a public-service 
        organization, to accumulate money and raise funds for timely investment. 
        Furthermore, if the business of a public-service organization has become, 
        or may become, in competition with that of commercial companies due to 
        changes in the social or economic situation, Japanese law requires the 
        public-service organization to take action to correct its position as 
        appropriate; if it cannot take action, the business should be converted 
        into a commercial company.</p>
      <p>These developments led to consideration of a reconfiguration of the arrangements 
        for registration within the .jp ccTLD. As a result of intensive discussions 
        and consultations with its members and the Internet community, JPNIC judged 
        that it would be appropriate to establish a new company, to which management 
        and administration of the .jp top-level domain would be transferred. At 
        the JPNIC 11th General Meeting held on 22 December 2000, two proposals 
        were submitted and approved by a majority of its members: &quot;Establishment 
        of a new company, for management and administration of the general-use 
        .jp domain name;&quot; and &quot;Changes in JPNIC's membership system 
        and fee schedule, and transfer of management and administration of organizational 
        type/geographical type .jp domain name to the new company.&quot; </p>
      <p>Based on the resolutions of the 22 December General Meeting, <a href="http://jprs.jp/en/">JPRS</a> 
        (Japan Registry Service Co., Ltd.) was established on 26 December 2000. 
        Since then, JPNIC, JPRS and the Internet community have discussed the 
        applicable policy for the management and administration of .jp top-level 
        domain to be smoothly transferred from a public service organization to 
        a private company. This policy also aims for the management and administration 
        of the .jp top-level domain to be more efficient and competitive, ensuring 
        that it is acting in the public interest, while at the same time providing 
        convenience for users.</p>
      <p>After considerable study and discussion, an outline of the transfer was 
        agreed upon by JPNIC and JPRS. On 9 November 2001, the <a href="/cctld/jp/jprs-jpnic-memorandum-09nov01.htm">Memorandum 
        for the Transfer of Management and Administration of the .jp Top Level 
        Domain</a> was executed by the two organizations, and <a href="/cctld/jp/report-to-sakamoto-12nov01.htm">on 
        12 November 2001, they reported to the Japanese governmental authority</a> 
        about the execution of this Memorandum. On 3 December 2001, JPRS submitted 
        a <a href="/cctld/jp/redelegation-request-03dec01.htm">request to the 
        IANA for redelegation of the .jp top-level domain</a> to it and expressed 
        its desire to execute an appropriate ccTLD Sponsorship Agreement with 
        ICANN.<br>

      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm#sow2.1.1.2">includes</a> 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs, investigating 
        the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">Internet 
        Domain Name System Structure and Delegation</a>&quot; (ICP-1). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</a> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects 
        subsequent documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA 
        through May 1999.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot;</p>
      <p>Upon receiving JPRS's redelegation request, <a href="/cctld/jp/inquiry-regarding-endorsements-25dec01.htm">the 
        IANA consulted</a> with the administrative and technical contact and with 
        the Japanese Government regarding their views on the appropriateness of 
        redelegation and about the extent to which the Japanese Internet community 
        had been consulted. In response, the IANA received reponses from <a href="/cctld/jp/sakamoto-to-lynn-30jan02.htm">Yasuo 
        Sakamoto of the Japanese Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, 
        Posts and Telecommunications</a> and from <a href="/cctld/jp/murai-to-lynn-28jan02.htm">Jun 
        Murai, the present delegee of the .jp ccTLD</a>, endorsing, after significant 
        analysis, redelegation of the .jp ccTLD to JPRS. These responses also 
        detail significant consultation with the Japanese Internet community and 
        describe the strong support the proposed redelegation has received. Based 
        on this showing, it is the IANA's conclusion that there is widespread 
        support for moving the delegation of the .jp ccTLD to JPRS.</p>
      <p>In February 2000, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/">ICANN 
        Governmental Advisory Committee</a> (GAC) issued a document entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>,&quot; 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot; These principles serve 
        as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments in assuming proper 
        roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, which the GAC has 
        observed is a public resource to be administered in the public interest. 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibilty 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system. The GAC Principles recommend that governments and ICANN pursue 
        their respective roles by creating a framework for accountability memorialized 
        in communications with each other and with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see clauses <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">5.5</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">9</a>). 
        Among these specific principles, the best practices contemplate that governments 
        will assist in ensuring that the ccTLD manager complies with ICANN polices 
        related to global coordination of the Internet DNS (clauses <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7">9.1.7</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.8">9.1.8</a>).</p>
      <p>These principles are consistent with Japanese Government policy, which 
        favors private-sector management of the domain-name system with appropriate 
        oversight to protect the public interest. As explained in its endorsement 
        letter, the Japanese Government will, with the assistance of JPNIC (a 
        public-service organization operating under governmental supervision), 
        ensure that JPRS operates the .jp ccTLD in accord with the best interests 
        of the Japanese Internet community. In accord with the GAC Principles, 
        the <a href="/cctld/jp/jprs-jpnic-memorandum-09nov01.htm">9 November 2001 
        Memorandum for the Transfer of Management and Administration of the .jp 
        Top Level Domain</a> between JPRS and JPNIC establishes sound mechanisms 
        that permit JPNIC, and through it the Japanese Government, to carry out 
        the responsibiilty for ensuring the interest of the local Internet community 
        is served. In addition, in its <a href="/cctld/jp/sakamoto-to-lynn-30jan02.htm">endorsement 
        letter to ICANN</a>, the Japanese Government has recognized &quot;ICANN's 
        function to establish, disseminate and oversee implementation of the technical 
        standards and practices that relate to the operation of the global domain-name 
        system&quot; and stated that it &quot;considers ICANN to be the appropriate 
        international entity to oversee the technical coordination of the Internet 
        in a manner that will preserve it as an effective and convenient mechanism 
        for global communication.&quot;</p>
      <p>By migrating the delegation of the .jp ccTLD from the responsibility 
        of a trusted individual acting under informal understandings with the 
        IANA to a more formal, legally enforcable, set of arrangements among a 
        delegee organization, the relevant government, and ICANN (which performs 
        the IANA function), the proposed delegation will promote a durable legacy 
        of service to the local Internet community and will help assure continued 
        Internet interoperability through the global technical coordination that 
        ICANN was created to provide. In this regard, the recognition the Japanese 
        Government's discussion of the need for close coordination between ICANN 
        and the government is particularly noteworthy. In particular, as noted 
        in the endorsement letter, it is important that there be coordination 
        of local (under Japanese Government/JPNIC supervision) and global policy 
        requirements for the .jp ccTLD as well as of steps taken to terminate 
        and replace JPRS as the delegee of the .jp ccTLD should that ever become 
        necessary.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The structure proposed by JPRS and endorsed by JPNIC and the Japanese 
        Government is to have JPRS undertake management of the .jp ccTLD under 
        appropriate oversight of the Japanese Government, with the assistance 
        of JPNIC, concerning national public-policy interests. JPRS, JPNIC, and 
        the Japanese Government also acknowledge and support ICANN's responsibility 
        for coordinating management of the DNS, including the .jp ccTLD, to safeguard 
        global technical-coordination interests. This structure is consonant with 
        the principle of private-sector responsibility for technical coordination 
        under which the Internet has flourished. In reviewing the request and 
        in light of the Japanese Government's endorsement of JPRS as the appropriate 
        private-sector manager, the IANA concludes that, provided JPRS's commitment 
        to these responsibilities is effectively ensured, JPRS is the appropriate 
        delegee of the .jp ccTLD.</p>
      <p>One mechanism to reflect these commitments is the arrangement embodied 
        in the GAC Principles. Where the relevant government (here with the assistance 
        of JPNIC, a public-service ogranization under its jurisdiction) is prepared 
        to carry out the ultimate responsibility for overseeing the ccTLD manager's 
        service to the local Internet community and the manager is prepared to 
        conduct itself within that framework, the interests of the local and global 
        Internet communities are served by ICANN joining into that cooperative 
        arrangement. </p>
      <p>Two of the three parts of that arrangement&#150;the delegee/Government 
        and Government/ICANN communications&#150;have already been implemented. 
        Upon conclusion of a mutually satisfactory agreement between ICANN and 
        JPRS reflecting the principles set forth in <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#10">clause 
        10 of the GAC Principles</a>, adjusted as necessary to suit local circumstances, 
        the .jp ccTLD should be redelgated to JPRS. Once such an agreement is 
        entered, the U.S. Department of Commerce should establish revised procedures 
        for maintenance of the .jp entry in the root zone file that enable ICANN 
        to perform its obligations under that agreement, and that permit moving 
        forward responsibly with the transition to private-sector technical management 
        of the Internet.<br>
