      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA) is responsible for 
        various administrative functions associated with management of the Internet's 
        domain-name system root zone, including reviewing the appropriateness 
        of various contemplated changes to the content of the root zone and preparing 
        reports on those changes. This report gives the findings and conclusions 
        of the IANA on the establishment of the .pro top-level domain (TLD).</P>
      <p><b><a name="Factualand ProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></P>
      <p>The Internet domain-name system (DNS) was deployed under the guidance 
        of <a href="http://www.postel.org/jonpostel.html">Jon Postel</a> in 1984 
        and 1985 (see <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc921.txt">RFC&nbsp;921</a>) 
        as a distributed database for information about resources on the Internet, 
        replacing the prior &quot;hosts.txt&quot; system. The DNS contains resource 
        records that map easy-to-remember domain names to the unique numeric addresses 
        assigned to every computer on the Internet.</P>
      <p>The DNS is organized hierarchically with several top-level domains (TLDs) 
        containing second-level domains (SLDs), which in turn contain third-level 
        domains (3LDs), etc. A domain name consists of a series of labels, separated 
        by dots, tracing the hierarchy from the top-level domain down to the specific 
        computer being identified: &lt;3LD&gt;.&lt;SLD&gt;.&lt;TLD&gt;. Thus, 
        the domain name &quot;www.icann.org&quot; is within the &quot;www&quot; 
        third-level domain of the &quot;icann&quot; second-level domain of the 
        &quot;org&quot; top-level domain.</P>
      <p>To take advantage of the DNS's hierarchical nature, it was initially 
        contemplated that there would be a limited number of top-level domains. 
        In <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc920.txt">RFC&nbsp;920</a>, 
        entitled &quot;Domain Requirements&quot; (Oct. 1984), Dr. Postel and Joyce 
        Reynolds proposed top-level domains with the names &quot;arpa&quot; (intended 
        to be transitional for the &quot;ARPA-Internet&quot;), &quot;com&quot; 
        (commercial), &quot;edu&quot; (education), &quot;gov&quot; (government), 
        &quot;mil&quot; (military), and &quot;org&quot; (organization) as well 
        as two-letter (alpha-2) names identifying countries according to the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html">ISO&nbsp;3166-1 
        list</a>.&quot;<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> By the time of actual implementation 
        of the top-level domains in January 1985, an additional top-level domain 
        named &quot;net&quot; was included. In November 1988, an additional top-level 
        domain named &quot;int&quot; was added for international organizations 
        established by intergovernmental agreements. </P>
      <p>In March 1994, Dr. Postel published <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC&nbsp;1591</a>, 
        entitled &quot;Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; (J. Postel 
        March 1994), which described the overall structure of the DNS at the time. 
        He described the top-level domains as follows:</P>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>There are a set of what are called &quot;top-level domain names&quot; 
          (TLDs). These are the generic TLDs (EDU, COM, NET, ORG, GOV, MIL, and 
          INT), and the two letter country codes from ISO-3166. It is extremely 
          unlikely that any other TLDs will be created.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Beginning in 1995-1996, some members of the Internet community expressed 
        concern over lack of choice concerning registration services in the generic 
        top-level domains (gTLDs). By January 1998, the U.S. Department of Commerce, 
        in issuing its Green Paper<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> as a discussion 
        draft concerning possible improvements in the technical management of 
        the DNS, listed &quot;widespread dissatisfaction about the absence of 
        competition in domain name registration&quot; as a principal motivation 
        for its conclusion that improvements in the Internet's technical management 
        were necessary. The Green Paper discussed the introduction of additional 
        TLDs in this context.</P>
      <p>In June 1998, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its White Paper,<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> 
        calling on the Internet community to form a new, not-for-profit organization 
        to assume responsibility for the necessarily centralized technical coordination 
        functions then performed by the IANA. In response, the Internet community 
        formed the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 
        in late 1998.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></P>
      <p>The White Paper specified that one of ICANN's principal responsibilities 
        would be to &quot;oversee policy for determining the circumstances under 
        which new TLDs are added to the root system,&quot; including &quot;development 
        of policies for the addition, allocation, and management of gTLDs and 
        the establishment of domain name registries and domain name registrars 
        to host gTLDs . . . .&quot; As the White Paper recognized, &quot;The challenge 
        of deciding policy for the addition of new domains will be formidable.&quot; 
        To address this challenge, in the White Paper the U.S. Government observed, 
        &quot;At least in the short run, a prudent concern for the stability of 
        the system suggests that expansion of gTLDs proceed at a deliberate and 
        controlled pace to allow for evaluation of the impact of the new gTLDs 
        and well-reasoned evolution of the domain space.&quot;</P>
      <p>For nearly the entire time since it was formed, ICANN has devoted a significant 
        part of its activities to the consideration of the establishment of new 
        generic TLDs. At the ICANN meeting in Berlin in May 1999, ICANN's Board 
        referred the issue of new TLDs to the (then newly formed) Domain Name 
        Supporting Organization (DNSO).<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> In response 
        to this referral, in June 1999 the DNSO Names Council (which manages the 
        process for development of policy recommendations within the DNSO) <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/19990625.NCsj-admin.html">created</a> 
        a group, known as Working Group C, to study the issues raised by the introduction 
        of new TLDs.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> After nine months of extensive 
        discussions<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> and review of several position 
        papers,<sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Working Group C submitted its <a href="http://www.icann.org/dnso/wgc-report-21mar00.htm">report 
        to the DNSO Names Council on 21 March 2000</a>,<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> 
        recommending introduction of a limited number of TLDs, and posted the 
        report for public comment. Public comments were <a href="http://www.icann.org/dnso/new-gtlds-01apr00.htm">solicited</a> 
        and received through the <a href="http://forum.icann.org/wgc/">ICANN's 
        web-based comment forum</a> and <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/dnsocomments/comments-gtlds/Arc01/maillist.html">via 
        e-mail to the dnso.org site</a>.</P>
      <p>The Names Council discussed the report and comments at a <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/20000418.NCtelecon-minutes.html">telephone 
        conference held on 18/19 April 2000</a>. At that meeting, the Names Council 
        adopted the following statement, by a vote of 16-0 (two members were absent):</P>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The Names Council therefore recommends to the ICANN Board that it establish 
          a policy for the introduction of new gTLDs in a measured and responsible 
          manner, giving due regard in the implementation of that policy to (a) 
          promoting orderly registration of names during the initial phases; (b) 
          minimizing the use of gTLDs to carry out infringements of intellectual 
          property rights; and (c) recognizing the need for ensuring user confidence 
          in the technical operation of the new TLD and the DNS as a whole.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The DNSO recommendation continued:</P>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>we recommend to the Board that a limited number of new top-level domains 
          be introduced initially and that the future introduction of additional 
          top-level domains be done only after careful evaluation of the initial 
          introduction.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>On 16 July 2000, after considering <a href="http://forum.icann.org/newtlds/">well 
        over 1000 public comments</a>, the ICANN Board <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-16jul00.htm#00.46">adopted 
        the DNSO recommendations</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-16jul00.htm#00.47">authorized 
        the ICANN President to formally call for proposals</a> to operate or sponsor 
        new TLDs.</P>
      <p>On 15 August 2000, ICANN <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-application-process.htm">posted 
        a public call for applications</a> on its web site<sup><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/announcements/icann-pr16aug00.htm">broadly 
        announced the availability of the application materials</a>. At the same 
        time, ICANN published <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-criteria-15aug00.htm">detailed 
        criteria</a> for the consideration of any applications received. In response 
        to the call, <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-applications-lodged-02oct00.htm">forty-four 
        completed applications</a> were received.</P>
      <p>Once these applications were submitted, they were posted on ICANN's web 
        site for public comment. Over 4000 comments were received; <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/app-index.htm">all 
        appeared on ICANN's web site</a>. ICANN also assembled a team of technical, 
        financial, and legal experts<sup><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> to review 
        and evaluate the applications, which issued a <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/report/">326-page 
        evaluation report</a> on the applications. Additional public comments 
        were received on this report, both on a <a href="http://forum.icann.org/tldreport/">web-based 
        forum established by ICANN for this purpose</a> (over 1000 comments received) 
        and at an <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/icann/la2000/archive/">all-day 
        public forum</a> held in Marina del Rey, California, USA on 15 November 
        2000.</P>
      <p>The introduction of new TLDs was the principal issue addressed at <a href="http://www.icann.org/mdr2000/">ICANN's 
        second annual meeting in November 2000</a>. Leading up to that meeting, 
        the Internet community had spent several weeks reviewing the applications 
        and the detailed evaluation report, engaged in a robust dialogue on ICANN's 
        web-based public forums (with a total of over 5000 postings), and intensely 
        discussed the issues through ICANN's constituency and supporting organization 
        structures. After extensive study of the materials in advance of the meeting 
        and participation in the all-day public forum, the ICANN Board discussed 
        the applications in a <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/icann/la2000/archive/agenda-bm-111600.html">several-hour 
        open session on 16 November 2000</a>. As a result of this review, seven 
        proposals to operate or sponsor TLDs <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-16nov00.htm#00.89">were 
        selected</a> for an initial introduction of TLDs, as recommended by the 
        DNSO.</P>
      <p>In late 2000, ICANN and the proponents of the selected proposals began 
        negotiations for appropriate agreements under which those TLDs could be 
        introduced while preserving the stability of the DNS. These discussions 
        led to the development of two model agreements: one for &quot;sponsored&quot; 
        TLDs and another for &quot;unsponsored&quot; TLDs. Generally speaking, 
        an unsponsored TLD operates under policies established by the global Internet 
        community directly through the ICANN process, while a sponsored TLD is 
        a specialized TLD that has a sponsor representing the narrower community 
        that is most affected by the TLD. The sponsor thus carries out delegated 
        policy-formulation responsibilities over many matters concerning the TLD.</P>
      <p>In April and July 2001, negotiations of the unsponsored agreements for 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/biz/">.biz</a>, <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/info/">.info</a>, 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/name/">.name</a> were 
        completed and the agreements were subsequently signed. The IANA issued 
        reports on <a href="/reports/biz-info-report-25jun01.htm">.biz and .info</a> 
        (25 June 2001) and <a href="/reports/name-report-16aug01.htm">.name</a> 
        (16 August 2001). These three unsponsored TLDs have been added to the 
        root zone.</P>
      <p>In August and November 2001, the negotiations for agreements with the 
        three sponsored TLDs (<a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/museum/">.museum</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/coop/">.coop</a>, and <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/aero/">.aero</a>) 
        were completed; these agreements were signed (after review periods) on 
        17 October, 21 November, and 17 December 2001. On 30 October, 13 December, 
        and 19 December 2001 the IANA issued reports concluding that the <a href="/reports/museum-report-30oct01.htm">.museum</a>, 
        <a href="/reports/coop-report-13dec01.htm">.coop</a>, and <a href="/reports/aero-report-19dec01.htm">.aero</a> 
        TLDs should be added to the root zone, and each has in fact been added.</P>
      <p>Negotiations of the fourth unsponsored TLD agreement&nbsp;&#150; for 
        .pro&nbsp;&#150; were required to address several novel complexities and 
        therefore were not completed until 6 March 2002. The completed agreement 
        and all of its attachments were <a href="http://www.icann.org/accra/pro-agmt-topic.htm">posted 
        on 7 March 2002</a> and discussed at the <a href="http://www.icann.org/accra/index.html#13March">ICANN 
        Public Forum held in Accra, Ghana, on 13 March 2002</a>. The ICANN Board 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-14mar02.htm#proAgreement">approved 
        ICANN's entry into the agreement on 14 March 2002</a> and, after final 
        corrections, the agreement was signed by both parties on 3 May 2002.</P>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></P>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">21 
        March 2001 contact for performance of the IANA function</a> between the 
        United States Government and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names 
        and Numbers. Under that contract, the IANA is responsible for various 
        functions, known as the &quot;IANA functions&quot;, associated with the 
        management of the root zone of the Internet domain-name system.</P>
      <p>As contemplated by the White Paper, in 1999 and 2000 the Internet community 
        pursued an extensive consensus-development process through ICANN and its 
        Domain Name Supporting Organization. This process, which included extensive 
        participation by hundreds of individuals and organizations in the Internet 
        community, reached the consensus position, as <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/20000418.NCtelecon-minutes.html">recommended 
        by the DNSO Names Council without dissent</a>, that &quot;a limited number 
        of new top-level domains [should] be introduced initially and that the 
        future introduction of additional top-level domains [should] be done only 
        after careful evaluation of the initial introduction.&quot; Following 
        this policy and through additional community-based processes, ICANN selected 
        seven proposals for the initial introduction, with the goal of launching 
        these TLDs cautiously, then observing and evaluating the results.</P>
      <p>If the initial introduction is successful, this experience should lay 
        the groundwork for future introductions as part of what the White Paper 
        termed a &quot;well-reasoned evolution of the domain space.&quot; In fall 
        2001, ICANN formed a &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/ntepptf/">New 
        TLD Evaluation Process Planning Task Force</a>&quot; charged with developing 
        a plan for monitoring the introduction of new TLDs and for evaluating 
        their performance impact on the performance of the DNS. That task force 
        has been undertaking that effort since that time.</P>
      <p>ICANN has now completed contractual arrangements for the introduction 
        of the seventh of the selected TLDs, with RegistryPro for .pro.</P>
      <p>The first goal of the community-based management of the DNS is to preserve 
        the DNS's stable and reliable operation. Like the previous registry agreements 
        for the other new unsponsored TLDs (.biz, .info, and .name) the .pro registry 
        agreement has been designed to ensure that this TLD is introduced in a 
        sound manner that will maintain stable and reliable technical operation 
        of the DNS. In particular, the contract recites functional and performance 
        specifications, data escrow requirements, and a detailed start-up plan 
        that is designed to ensure that stable operation of the DNS is maintained, 
        both during the startup phase and in the long term. In addition, the .pro 
        agreement's appendices include provisions tailored to the unique character 
        of the .pro TLD. The .pro TLD is intended to contain domain names registered 
        only to credentialed professionals (and related organizations) and to 
        provide facilities to those accessing those domains to verify their authenticity. 
        This presented several new challenges that have been addressed in the 
        .pro appendices.</P>
      <p>User awareness is also relevant to smooth operation of the DNS; experience 
        has shown that some level of confusion accompanies almost any change in 
        the DNS. The operator of .pro however, has committed to information-dissemination 
        measures that should keep any public confusion to a minimum.</P>
      <p>Registration activities for .pro will commence over the next several 
        months. To assist in a stable introduction with the public awareness needed 
        to minimize confusion, ICANN has agreed with RegistryPro that the .pro 
        TLD should be established in the DNS at this time for testing and evaluation 
        purposes.<sup><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup> Initially, the nameservice 
        for the domains will be operated by the IANA, which will conduct various 
        testing procedures and then, according to schedules and procedures developed 
        jointly with RegistryPro, transition the nameservice to servers operated 
        by the company in time for the onset of regular resolution of .pro domain 
        names.</P>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></P>
      <p>The IANA concludes that the .pro TLD should be established by adding 
        it to the root zone at this time for testing and evaluation. To ensure 
        a smooth and stable introduction, the nameservice should be operated initially 
        by the IANA and then transitioned to the selected operator, RegistryPro, 
        after the .pro zone is ready for population with the initial registrations 
        and its nameserver constellations are demonstrated to be stable and robust.</P>

        also indicated that top-level domains might be added in the future for 
        &quot;multiorganizations&quot;. This was never pursued, except to the 
        extent of the .int top-level domain introduced in 1988.</P>
      <p><a name="fn2"></a>2. Although the .arpa domain was intended to be used 
        only in the transition to the DNS, it was not discontinued as originally 
        planned because it contained the reverse-lookup domain for IP addresses 
        (in-addr.arpa). See <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1101.txt">RFC&nbsp;1101</a>, 
        &quot;DNS Encoding of Network Names and Other Types&quot; (P. Mockapetris 
        Apr. 1989), for background. The continuing importance of the reverse-lookup 
        facility and the practical difficulties in moving it to another domain, 
        made it infeasible to eliminate the .arpa top-level altogether. In May 
        2000, the Internet Architecture Board published its &quot;<a href="http://www.iab.org/iab/DOCUMENTS/statement-on-infrastructure-domains.txt">Statement 
        on Infrastructure Domain and Subdomains</a>&quot;, which recommends permanent 
        retention of the .arpa TLD for Internet-infrastructure purposes. The &quot;arpa&quot; 
        abbreviation was redesignated to &quot;Address and Routing Parameter Area&quot; 
        to reduce confusion with the earlier network name. See also <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3172.txt">RFC&nbsp;3172</a>.</P>

      <p><a name="fn5"></a>5. In response to the White Paper, Internet stakeholders 
        from around the world came together in an extensive process of discussions 
        and negotiations. The process included meetings, conferences, and most 
        appropriately for the purpose, extensive use of the Internet. By the beginning 
        of October 1998, this process had reached a successful conclusion and 
        on behalf of the global Internet community Dr. Postel <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/icann/icann.html">submitted 
        to the U.S. Commerce Department</a> articles of incorporation and proposed 
        bylaws for ICANN to &quot;reflect the consensus judgment of the global 
        Internet community as to how to form a corporation that will include the 
        IANA function, and in addition take on other coordination and administrative 
        responsibilities necessary for the continued operational stability and 
        growth of the Internet. &quot; See <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/icann/letter.htm">Letter

      <p><a name="fn7"></a>7. At its <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/19990625.NCsj-admin.html">25 
        June 1999 meeting in San Jose, California, USA</a>, the Names Council 
        also created another group, known as Working Group B, to study issues 
        concerning the protection of famous trademarks in the context of any newly 
        introduced generic TLDs.</P>
      <p><a name="fn8"></a>8. These discussions are archived in two parts: <a href="http://www.dnso.org/wgroups/wg-c/Arc00/maillist.html">up 
        to 23 November 1999</a> and <a href="http://www.dnso.org/wgroups/wg-c/Arc01/maillist.html">after 
        that date</a>.</P>

        October 1999 Interim Report of Working Group C</a>.</P>
      <p><a name="fn10"></a>10. Working Group C provided a <a href="http://www.icann.org/dnso/wgc-supp-report-17apr00.htm">supplemental 
        report</a> on 17 April 2000.</P>
      <p><a name="fn11"></a>11. This call was preceded, on 3 August 2000, by the 
        posting of an <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/application-process-03aug00.htm">overview 
        of the upcoming application process</a>, which was also <a href="http://www.icann.org/announcements/icann-pr03aug00.htm">broadly 
        announced</a>.</P>

        their qualifications and the measures employed to ensure their independence 
        is <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/report/report-ii-09nov00.htm#IIC">posted

      <p><a name="fn13"></a>13. A similar procedure was followed with .biz, .info, 
        and .name. In addition to revealing an issue concerning inappropriate 
        DNS dynamic update attempts due to misconfigured client computers throughout 
        the Internet, this procedure allowed the registry operators for those 
        TLDs to establish their network information center websites at an early 
        stage, before they were ready for full launch of their nameserver constellations. 
        These websites assisted in efforts to educate the public about the new 
        TLDs and also permited testing of interactive websites to determine whether 
        they properly interact with computers in the domains of the new TLDs.</P>
