      <p align="left">The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part 
        of the administrative functions associated with management of the domain-name 
        system root, is responsible for receiving requests for delegation and 
        redelegation of top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent 
        to those requests, and reporting on the requests. Earlier this year, the 
        IANA received a request for changing the sponsoring organization, administrative 
        contact, and technical contact for the .la country-code top-level domain 
        (ccTLD). This report gives the findings and conclusions of the IANA on 
        its investigation of that request.</p>
      <p align="left"><b><a name="Background"></a>Background</b></p>
      <p align="left">The .la ccTLD was established in May 1996 based on the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html#lr">assignment 
        of the &quot;la&quot; code in the ISO 3166-1 list</a> to the Lao People’s 
        Democratic Republic. The .la ccTLD was initially to Mr. Sisomphet Nhoybouakong 
        (an employee in the Lao PDR Prime Minister’s office) as administrative 
        contact and the Keeper of Domains, of Singapore Telecom, SingNet (of Singapore) 
        as technical contact.</p>
      <p align="left">In January 2001, the IANA received a request from Keeper 
        of Domains, SingNet (the technical contact) requesting that the technical 
        contact be changed to Master of Domains, Sterling. Sterling Pacific Pty., 
        Ltd. is a Hong Kong-based company that had entered into a Technical Cooperation 
        Agreement concerning the .la ccTLD with the Lao Government. Sterling was 
        engaged, through a <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/webbox/bw.121100/203460246.htm">program 
        announced in December 2000</a> to register domain names within the .la 
        ccTLD in the United States and elsewhere, with the suggestion that .la 
        registrations could be of interest to those in &quot;Los Angeles, Latin 
        America or Louisiana.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Although the request to change the technical contact was 
        confirmed by the technical contact, the administrative contact did not 
        initially respond to the IANA's inquiries regarding his position. In November 
        2001, the IANA received a letter from the Lao PDR Prime Minister's Office 
        notifying the IANA that the Technical Cooperation Agreement between Sterling 
        and the Lao Government had been terminated by notices in April and June 
        2000, and that subsequently the Lao Courts had issued an interim order 
        &quot;on 8 August 2001 ruling the termination lawful and ordering the 
        ceasing of all operations by Sterling in relation to ccTLD .la.&quot; 
        Despite the termination by the Lao Government of the Technical Cooperation 
        Agreement, Sterling continued to operate, market, and promote the .la 
        ccTLD though a website it branded as &quot;dotLA&nbsp;&#150; L.A.'s own 
        domain.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">In early 2002, the IANA received a request from the Lao 
        Government that the .la ccTLD be redelegated to the Lao National Internet 
        Committee (LANIC, a committee of governmental ministers), with designated 
        in-country administrative and technical contacts.</p>
      <p align="left">The Lao Government seeks, in this redelegation request, 
        to put the .la TLD on a more institutional basis under a Memorandum of 
        Understanding with ICANN, in place of the current delegation to Sisomphet 
        Nhoybouakong as administrative contact and Keeper of Domains, SingNet 
        as technical contact. Both the present administrative contact and the 
        present technical contact have consented to the redelegation. On 17 September 
        2002, the ICANN Board of Directors <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-17sep02.htm#MOUforlaccTLD">authorized 
        the entry</a> of this Memorandum of Understanding, which closely parallels 
        prior MoUs entered for the <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/bi/">.bi</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/mw/">.mw</a> 
        ccTLDs, with the Lao Government.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Under 
        that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm#sow2.1.1.2">includes</a> 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs, investigating 
        the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">Internet 
        Domain Name System Structure and Delegation</a>&quot; (ICP-1). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC&nbsp;1591</a> 
        (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects subsequent 
        documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA through May 
        1999.</p>
      <p>Here, the Lao Government's request is to shift the delegation from an 
        employee of its Science, Technology, and Environment Agency (STEA, formerly 
        known as the Science, Technology, and Environment Organization or STENO) 
        and Keeper of Domains, Singnet to the Lao National Internet Committee 
        (LANIC). LANIC was established by a decree of the Lao Prime Minister and 
        consists of representatives of the Ministry of Communication,Transportation, 
        Posts and Construction; the Ministry of Information and Culture; the Ministry 
        of Interior; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and STEA.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA also seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot; 
        Here, the government has requested the redelegation.</p>
      <p>Mutual agreement of the old and new delegees is also a significant factor 
        favoring a redelegation. Here, both present delegees (Sisomphet Nhoybouakong 
        as administrative contact and Keeper of Domains, SingNet as technical 
        contact) as well as the proposed new delegee (LANIC) favor the change 
        in delegation.</p>
      <p>LANIC appears well-positioned to operate the .la ccTLD in a sound and 
        stable manner that will promote the development of the Internet in the 
        Lao PDR. ccTLDs have been established to facilitate and promote the spread 
        of the Internet globally. They are delegated to designated managers, who 
        operate the ccTLDs according to local policies that are adapted to best 
        meet the economic, cultural, linguistic, and legal circumstances of the 
        country or territory involved. LANIC has been involved in several initiatives 
        to advance development of the Internet within the Lao PDR, as appropriate 
        in the context of that country’s governmental system. Its mission includes 
        promoting the efficient and permanent connection and exchange of information 
        within the country and abroad, and thereby promoting socio-economic development.</p>
      <p>The shifting of ccTLD delegations from individuals that have been designated 
        informally as administrative and technical contacts to organizations operating 
        under written agreements or memoranda of understanding is a positive step 
        toward the stable and professional operation of ccTLDs in the public interest. 
        As the Internet becomes increasingly important to global society, it is 
        important that a framework of accountability be established for the operation 
        of all top-level domains, both to promote the global interoperability 
        of the domain-name system and to ensure that the interests of local Internet 
        communities are well-served.</p>
      <p>In February 2000, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/">ICANN 
        Governmental Advisory Committee</a> (GAC) issued a document entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>,&quot; 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot; These principles serve 
        as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments in assuming proper 
        roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, which the GAC has 
        observed is a public resource to be administered in the public interest. 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibility 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system.</p>
      <p>In entering the MoU with ICANN, the Lao Government, through LANIC, formally 
        assumes responsibility for national public-policy aspects of the .la ccTLD, 
        while acknowledging the importance of ICANN's role in ccordinating an 
        effective and interoperable domain-name system. Clarification of this 
        allocation of responsibility is an added benefit of the shifting of the 
        delegation to LANIC.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The IANA concludes that the .la ccTLD should be redelegated, as requested, 
        from the current delegees to LANIC.</p>
