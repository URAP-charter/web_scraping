      <P>Subject: Redelegation of the .org Top-Level Domain<br>
        Date: 9 December 2002</P>
      <HR ALIGN=LEFT> <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA) is 
        responsible for various administrative functions associated with management 
        of the Internet's domain-name system root zone, including reviewing the 
        appropriateness of contemplated changes to the content of the root zone 
        and preparing reports on those changes. This report gives the findings 
        and conclusions of the IANA on the redelegation of the .org top-level 
        domain (TLD) from operation by VeriSign, Inc., to operation by Public 
        Interest Registry.</p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a><font size="+1">Factual 
        and Procedural Background</font></b></p>
      <p><b><a name="A"></a>A. Background of the .org TLD</b></p>
      <p>The Internet domain-name system (DNS) was deployed under the guidance 
        of <a href="http://www.postel.org/jonpostel.html">Jon Postel</a> in 1984 
        and 1985 (see <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc921.txt">RFC 921</a>) 
        as a distributed database for information about resources on the Internet, 
        replacing the prior &quot;hosts.txt&quot; system. The DNS contains resource 
        records that map easy-to-remember domain names to the unique numeric addresses 
        assigned to every computer on the Internet.</p>
      <p>The DNS is organized hierarchically with several TLDs containing second-level 
        domains (SLDs), which in turn contain third-level domains (3LDs), etc. 
        A domain name consists of a series of labels, separated by dots, tracing 
        the hierarchy from the top-level domain down to the specific computer 
        being identified: &lt;3LD&gt;.&lt;SLD&gt;.&lt;TLD&gt;. Thus, the domain 
        name &quot;www.icann.org&quot; is within the &quot;www&quot; third-level 
        domain of the &quot;icann&quot; second-level domain of the &quot;org&quot; 
        top-level domain.</p>
      <p>As initially deployed, the DNS included both generic top-level domains 
        (gTLDs) and country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs). In <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc920.txt">RFC 
        920</a>, entitled &quot;Domain Requirements&quot; (Oct. 1984), Dr. Postel 
        and Joyce Reynolds proposed a set of initial gTLDs including &quot;com&quot; 
        (commercial), &quot;edu&quot; (education), &quot;gov&quot; (government), 
        &quot;mil&quot; (military), and &quot;org&quot; (organization).&quot; 
        By the time of actual implementation of the top-level domains in January 
        1985, an additional top-level domain named &quot;net&quot; was included.</p>
      <p>From the deployment of the DNS until the end of 1992, the gTLDs were 
        managed by SRI International's Network Information Center (SRI-NIC). Beginning 
        in 1993, the registration function within gTLDs was assumed by Network 
        Solutions, Inc. (NSI), under <a href="http://www.icann.org/nsi/coopagmt-01jan93.htm">Cooperative 
        Agreement NCR 92-18742 with the National Science Foundation</a>.</p>
      <p>That cooperative agreement was originally scheduled to conclude on 30 
        September 1998. In June 1998, however, the U.S. Department of Commerce 
        (which took over from the National Science Foundation as the responsible 
        U.S. Government agency) issued a <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/white-paper-05jun98.htm">Statement 
        of Policy commonly known as the &quot;White Paper&quot;</a> (&quot;Management 
        of Internet Names and Addresses,&quot; 63 Fed. Reg. 31741 (1998)), in 
        which it announced its intention to transition responsibilities for management 
        of the domain name space to a private, not-for-profit corporation (now 
        known as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or &quot;ICANN&quot;) 
        formed by the Internet community. In connection with the implementation 
        of the White Paper, the NSI-U.S. Government cooperative agreement was 
        extended in October 1998 (by <a href="http://www.icann.org/nsi/coopagmt-amend11-07oct98.htm">Amendment 
        11</a>) until 30 September 2000. In 1999, <a href="http://www.icann.org/nsi/nsi-registry-agreement-04nov99.htm">NSI 
        and ICANN reached an agreement</a> that supplemented the cooperative agreement 
        with an ICANN-NSI registry agreement, under which NSI's operatorship of 
        the .com, .net, and .org gTLDs was extended to 10 November 2003 or, if 
        certain conditions were met, 10 November 2007. At the same time, NSI and 
        the U.S. Department of Commerce amended the cooperative agreement to extend 
        for the same period. (<a href="http://www.icann.org/nsi/coopagmt-amend19-04nov99.htm">Amendment 
        19 to Cooperative Agreement NCR 92-18742</a>, section I(B)(10).)</p>
      <p>In May 2001, the ICANN-NSI registry agreement covering .com, .net, and 
        .org, was replaced with three registry agreements, which separately covered 
        (and had different termination provisions for) the three gTLDs.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> 
        The <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/verisign/registry-agmt-org-25may01.htm#5.1">registry 
        agreement for .org provided</a> that VeriSign, Inc. (which had acquired 
        NSI) would give up the operatorship of the .org registry on 31 December 
        2002,<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> after which a successor registry 
        operator designated by ICANN would assume responsibility for the operation 
        of .org.</p>

        the .org TLD</b></p>
      <p>At its <a href="http://www.icann.org/stockholm/">4 June 2001 meeting in Stockholm, Sweden</a>, 
        the ICANN Board of Directors <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-04jun01.htm#ReferraloforgIssuestoDNSO">referred 
        the issues</a> raised by the scheduled transition of the operation of 
        the .org gTLD to ICANN's Domain Name Supporting Organization (DNSO) Names 
        Council. The Names Council, in turn, formed a working group, which submitted 
        a <a href="http://www.dnso.org/clubpublic/council/Arc09/msg00031.html">report</a> 
        that the Names Council <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/20020117.NCteleconf-minutes.html">unanimously 
        adopted</a> at a meeting on 17 January 2002. The report was posted on 
        the ICANN web site for public comment, and an in-person Public Forum was 
        held on the topic on 13 March 2002 at <a href="http://www.icann.org/accra/">ICANN's 
        meeting in Accra, Ghana</a>.</p>
      <p>At the ICANN Board's meeting on 14 March 2002, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-14mar02.htm#orgReassignment">Board 
        authorized the solicitation of proposals</a> to succeed VeriSign as the 
        operator of the .org registry. ICANN then posted, <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/index-01may02.htm">in 
        draft form, a request for proposals</a>, which included the following 
        elements:</p>

      </ul>
      <p>After a two-week comment period, these materials were revised based on 
        the comments received. The <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/rfp-20may02.htm">final 
        request for proposals</a> was posted on 20 May 2002. In addition, ICANN 
        solicited written questions from prospective bidders, and on 24 May 2002 
        posted <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/faq-24may02.htm">46 detailed 
        answers to the questions received</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/applications-received-18jun02.htm">Eleven 
        proposals were received</a> by the 18 June 2002 deadline in response to 
        the request for proposals. Each of these proposals was posted on the ICANN 
        web site, and public comments were invited.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> 
        A special ICANN Public Forum was held on the evening of 26 June 2002 in 
        conjunction with ICANN's meeting in Bucharest, Romania, where each bidder 
        made a presentation to the ICANN Board and community on its proposal, 
        and a dialogue was held with members of the community, the Board, and 
        the bidders.<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
      <p>Over the next three months, four teams designated by ICANN evaluated 
        the applications under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/criteria-20may02.htm">eleven 
        criteria</a> that had been posted as part of the request for proposals. 
        The four teams, which focused on different aspects, were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gartner, Inc. performed a detailed evaluation of the technical aspects 
          of the eleven proposals;</li>
        <li> A team of Chief Information Officers of academic institutions in 
          the United States, Mexico, and Australia also did a technical evaluation, 
          which was more summary than the Gartner analysis and served as a validator 
          of it;</li>
        <li> A team of participants in the DNSO Non-Commercial Domain Name Holders 
          Constituency did an evaluation of the proposals under three of the stated 
          criteria, involving proposed measures to differentiate of the .org TLD, 
          responsiveness to the needs of the noncommercial Internet community, 
          and level of support from .org registrants and the non-commercial community; 
          and</li>
        <li> The ICANN General Counsel evaluated how well the proposals met certain 
          legal considerations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each of these teams based its evaluation on the written proposals, the 
        presentations at the Bucharest Public Forum, and public comments received 
        on the proposals through ICANN's online comment mechanisms. In addition, 
        the evaluators were assisted by the applicants' responses to fourteen 
        questions that were posed to clarify various aspects of the proposals. 
      </p>
      <p>On 19 August 2002, a <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/preliminary-evaluation-report-19aug02.htm">draft 
        evaluation report</a>, which detailed and combined the analyses of each 
        of the evaluation teams, was posted on ICANN's web site. This draft report 
        recommended the following three proposals, in order of preference: (1) 
        PIR (a not-for-profit organization proposed to be formed by the Internet 
        Society, (2) NeuStar, Inc. (a for-profit company), and (3) Global Name 
        Registry (a for-profit company). Public and applicant comments were invited 
        on the draft evaluation report, and many were received.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> 
        These comments pointed out several areas in which the evaluation could 
        be enhanced; these comments were addressed and a <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/final-evaluation-report-23sep02.htm">final 
        evaluation report</a> was issued on 23 September 2002. The final evaluation 
        report included an overall &quot;staff evaluation report&quot; and supporting 
        reports prepared by Gartner, Inc., the Non-Commercial Domain Name Holders 
        Constituency team, and the ICANN General Counsel. Although the final evaluation 
        report reflected revisions to several aspects of the evaluation based 
        on the comments received, the recommended preferences for selection of 
        (1) PIR, (2) NeuStar, and (3) Global Name Registry were reaffirmed by 
        the analysis.</p>
      <p>Further comments from the <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/applicant-comments-03oct02.htm">applicants</a> 
        and the <a href="http://forum.icann.org/org-eval/">public</a> were invited 
        on the final evaluation report, before its consideration by the ICANN 
        Board. Eight of the eleven bidders chose to submit <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/applicant-comments-03oct02.htm">written 
        summations</a> for consideration by the Board. These were posted on the 
        ICANN web site.</p>
      <p>On 14 October 2002, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-14oct02.htm#SuccessorOperatorfororgRegistry">ICANN 
        Board met to consider the proposals</a> in view of the extensive public 
        and applicant comment, as well as the evaluation reports by the various 
        evaluation teams. At that meeting, it selected PIR as the first-choice 
        successor, and authorized the ICANN President and General Counsel to &quot;negotiate 
        a registry agreement with PIR consistent with the model .org Registry 
        Agreement posted as part of the final Request for Proposals, supplemented 
        as appropriate according to the proposal submitted by the Internet Society.&quot;<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup></p>
      <p><b><a name="C"></a>C. Negotiation of the ICANN-PIR Agreement</b></p>
      <p>The .org Registry Agreement was negotiated over the next ten days. On 
        24 October 2002, the fully negotiated agreement was posted on the ICANN 
        web site. In line with ICANN's usual practice, ICANN Board members were 
        afforded seven days in which to raise objections to the agreements based 
        on policy considerations; no such objections were raised. On 26 November 
        2002, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/correspondence/doc-to-icann-26nov02.htm">U.S. 
        Department of Commerce approved PIR as successor registry</a> under <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/amend3-jpamou-25may01.htm#I">Amendment

        March 2001 contact for performance of the IANA function</a> between the 
        United States Government and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names 
        and Numbers. Under that contract, the IANA is responsible for various 
        functions, known as the &quot;IANA functions&quot;, associated with the 
        management of the root zone of the Internet domain-name system.</p>
      <p>The overall purpose of changing operators of the .org registry is to 
        enhance diversity of providers in the provision of registry services. 
        This purpose, however, must be accomplished in a way that preserves the 
        security and stability of the domain-name system. It should also be accomplished 
        in a way so that .org is operated in a manner that reflects the particular 
        needs of present .org registrants and the other entities within the non-commercial 
        sector for which the .org top-level domain was established.</p>
      <p>Because the .org TLD registry presently serves over 2,600,000 second-level 
        domains, ICANN placed primary emphasis on stability in evaluating the 
        proposals. Indeed, the first criterion for the selection was stability:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>1. Need to preserve a stable, well-functioning .org registry.</b></p>
        <p>ICANN's first priority is to preserve the stability of the Internet, 
          including the domain-name system (DNS). Inasmuch as the .org TLD presently 
          contains over 2,700,000 second-level domains, a principal consideration 
          will be ICANN's level of confidence that a particular proposal will 
          result in technically sound, high-quality services that meet the needs 
          of .org registrants.</p>
        <p>Proposals should include specific plans, backed by ample, firmly committed 
          resources, as to how the proposed operator intends to operate the .org 
          TLD in a stable and technically competent manner.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
          In evaluating proposals, ICANN will place significant emphasis on the 
          demonstrated ability of the applicant or a member of the proposing team 
          to operate a TLD registry of significant scale in a manner that provides 
          affordable services with a high degree of service responsiveness and 
          reliability.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/criteria.htm#1">Reassignment of 
        .org Top-Level Domain: Criteria for Assessing Proposals</a> (20 May 2002).</p>
      <p>This emphasis on stability was reflected throughout the evaluation process 
        and the Board's selection. After a twenty-five day transition period, 
        PIR will provide registration services through an outsourcing arrangement 
        with Afilias, which as the registry operator for .info has experience 
        in serving as registry operator for over 1,000,000 second-level domains. 
        The technical evaluation teams both evaluated the Internet Society/PIR 
        proposal as being within the top tier in terms of stability and other 
        technical factors.</p>
      <p>The evaluation considered not only the demonstrated the technical stability 
        provided by Afilias, but also the organizational characteristics of PIR. 
        PIR is a not-for-profit corporation organized under Pennsylvania law to 
        serve as the .org registry operator. Its sole member is the Internet Society, 
        which appoints its Board. The Internet Society was formed in 1992 and 
        is a professional membership society with more than 150 organizational 
        and 11,000 individual members in over 182 countries. Thus, the Internet 
        Society is a long-established organization that is particularly knowledgeable 
        about the needs of the organizations for which the .org top-level domain 
        was intended. By establishing PIR as a subsidiary to serve as the successor 
        operator of .org, the Internet Society has created a structure that can 
        operate the .org TLD in a manner that will be sensitive to the needs of 
        its intended users while allowing PIR to focus on the operation of .org 
        by insulating it from the possibly distracting effects of pursuing the 
        Internet Society's broader mission.</p>
      <p>Under the arrangements put in place by the Internet Society, Afilias 
        will provide start-up funding for PIR, after which PIR will receive one-third 
        of the revenues from operation of the registry. These arrangements should 
        provide PIR the financial resources necessary for it to operate in a financially 
        stable manner. In addition, the presence of Afilias as a back-end provider 
        provides assurance of continued stable operation of the .org registry. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/org/">negotiated .org 
        registry agreement</a> reinforces the overriding emphasis on technical 
        stability. It is modeled on the registry agreements ICANN has entered 
        for the four unsponsored TLDs (<a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/biz/">.biz</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/info/">.info</a>, <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/name/">.name</a>, 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/pro/">.pro</a>) that 
        have been introduced in 2001 and 2002. The agreement's features designed 
        to ensure that the continued stability of the .org TLD include functional 
        and performance specifications, data escrow requirements, and a detailed 
        transition plan (including contingency scenarios) that are designed to 
        ensure that .org customers and Internet users do not experience failures 
        or disruptions as a result of the reassignment of the .org registry.</p>
      <p>The reassignment of the .org registry from VeriSign to PIR will also 
        meet the goal of enhancing diversity in the provision of gTLD registry 
        services. Based on 1 July 2002 registration data, the top four providers 
        of registry services for commercial gTLDs<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>

      <p>These figures indicate that the reassignment or the .org registry from 
        VeriSign to PIR (with Afilias as a back-end provider) will materially 
        increase diversity among gTLD providers, although concentration remains 
        quite high.<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup></p>
      <p>The enhanced diversity of back-end providers also provides enhanced features 
        for the .org registry services. Among the enhanced .org features will 
        be <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/org/registry-agmt-appd-21oct02.htm#4.2">much 
        quicker DNS and Whois update times</a> (15 minutes maximum) than presently 
        provided (12 hours maximum), as well as a variety of <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/org/registry-agmt-appg-23oct02.htm#6">no-cost</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/org/registry-agmt-appg-23oct02.htm#4">low-cost</a> 
        ancillary registry services.</p>
      <p><b><a name="TransitionPlan"></a><font size="+1">Transition Plan</font></b></p>
      <p>To help ensure a stable transition, PIR has contracted with VeriSign, 
        Inc., to provide temporary back-end support for the .org registry beginning 
        on 1 January 2003. This will permit a phased transition, during which 
        the existing .org registrars that have completed contractual and other 
        arrangements with PIR will continue submitting registry updates to VeriSign's 
        registry system until 25 January 2003, in exactly the same technical manner 
        as they do at present. Effective 25 January 2003, VeriSign will cease 
        accepting .org updates from registrars and this function will be taken 
        over by the new back-end provider, Afilias. The Afilias system will initially 
        use the same protocol as presently used. Later in 2003, registrars will 
        begin a migration from the current RRP protocol to the more-fully-featured 
        EPP protocol, and will convert from the current thin registry model to 
        a thick registry model. These migrations, as well as extensive contingency 
        plans, are described in detail in PIR's Transition Plan. These plans 
        are technically conservative and should lead to a stable transition to 
        the new registry.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a><font size="+1">Conclusion</font></b></p>
      <p>Based on the foregoing factors, the .org registry should be reassigned 
        from VeriSign to Public Interest Registry as of 1 January 2003. This reassignment 
        offers a material increase in the diversity of providers of gTLD registry 
        services, while ensuring the continued stable operation of the .org registry.</p>

      <P><a name="fn7"></a>7. This table does not include .mil, .gov, .int, or 
        .edu, which are not ordinarily used for registrations by commercial entities. 
        In addition, the table does not include three recently introduced sponsored 
        TLDs (.aero, .coop, and .museum) and one special-purpose unsponsored TLD 
        (.pro), which account for fewer than 10,000 registered names combined. 
      <P><a name="fn8"></a>8. VeriSign is one of eighteen gTLD registrars that 
        jointly own Afilias. The <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/org/general-counsels-report-22sep02.htm#B">ICANN 
        General Counsel's evaluation</a> considered the competitive effect of 
        this ownership, and concluded that it would not impair the pro-competitive 
        effects of the reassignment: 
      <blockquote>
        <p>ISOC[PIR]'s back-end provider, Afilias, also has VeriSign as 
          an investor. Afilias is organized as a consortium of eighteen gTLD registrars. 
          VeriSign is a minority (5.6%) shareholder of Afilias as one of these 
          registrars. Because the other Afilias shareholders are VeriSign's 
          competitors, however, VeriSign's ability to exercise control over 
          Afilias is effectively minimized and, indeed, no VeriSign employee has 
          ever been elected to Afilias' Board of Trustees/Directors. In 
          these circumstances, it does not appear that this investment relationship 
          undercuts the competitive benefits of reassignment of .org, particularly 
          in view of the fact that the .org registry would be assigned to ISOC[/PIR], 
          not Afilias.<br>
