      <p align="left">The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part 
        of the administrative functions associated with management of the domain-name 
        system root, is responsible for receiving requests for delegation and 
        redelegation of top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent 
        to those requests, and reporting on the requests. In 2001, the IANA received 
        a request from the current technical contact for the .bi (Burundi) country-code 
        top-level domain (ccTLD) to change the sponsoring organization and change 
        the technical contact to an entity within the sponsoring organization. 
        This report gives the findings and conclusions of the IANA on its investigation 
        of that request.</p>
      <p align="left"><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual 
        and Procedural Background</b></p>
      <p align="left">The .bi ccTLD was first delegated in October 1996 to Fabien 
        Kayijuka as administrative contact and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Gr&eacute;goire 
        as technical contact. Mr. Kayijuka was associated with the IBPT&nbsp;&#150; 
        Connectivite au reseau Internet of Bujumbura, Burundi. At the time of 
        the initial delegation in 1996, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Gr&eacute;goire, 
        was associated with IZPT&nbsp;&#150; Connectivite au reseau Internet, 
        an ISP located in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo), 
        which at the time operated the (.zr) Zaire ccTLD. Because Burundi was 
        then dependent on infrastructure in Zaire for Internet connectivity, technical 
        support for the .bi ccTLD was initially handled by Mr. Gr&eacute;goire 
        of IZPT.</p>
      <p align="left">In 1998, the role of administrative contact was transferred 
        to Victor Ciza of Centre National de L'Informatique (CNI), who has served 
        as administrative contact since that time.</p>
      <p align="left">On 6 September 2001, Mr. Ciza submitted a request to the 
        IANA to change (among other items) the technical contact from Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric 
        Gr&eacute;goire to Felix Ndayirukiye, who is associated with CBINET s.a., 
        a subsidiary of CNI providing Internet services in Burundi. The request 
        also sought to amend the listed sponsoring organization to read only Centre 
        National de l'Informatique (CNI), the entity in Burundi. (The listed sponsoring 
        organization currently includes a reference to Interpoint SARL, a Swiss 
        organization with which Mr. Gr&eacute;goire is associated.) Thus, the 
        effect of the requests was to shift away from out-of-country operation 
        of the .bi ccTLD and to an in-country technical contact and sponsoring 
        organization. The existing technical contact, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Gr&eacute;goire, 
        agreed to these changes, as did Mr. Ciza.</p>
      <p align="left">Consultations were conducted within Burundi regarding this 
        change, which indicated significant support for moving the operation of 
        the .bi ccTLD into Burundi, and for the continued operation of the ccTLD 
        by CNI. In view of the proposed shift in the delegated authority over 
        the .bi domain, discussions ensued regarding establishing more formal 
        accountability regarding the delegation. By early 2002, CNI and the Internet 
        Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers had successfully negotiated 
        a memorandum of understanding under which the informal arrangements under 
        which Mr. Ciza and Mr. Gr&eacute;goire had been delegated responsibility 
        for the .bi domain would be replaced with a formally documented delegation 
        of the .bi ccTLD to CNI. After the Ministry of Communication of the Republic 
        of Burundi endorsed the redelegation to CNI and the entry of the memorandum 
        of understanding in March 2002, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/bi/">memorandum 
        was entered</a> as of 16 May 2002.</p>
      <p align="left"><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p align="left">This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Under 
        that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm#sow2.1.1.2">includes</a> 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs, investigating 
        the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</p>
      <p align="left">In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows 
        the practices summarized in &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">Internet 
        Domain Name System Structure and Delegation</a>&quot; (ICP-1). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC&nbsp;1591</a> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects 
        subsequent documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA 
        through May 1999.</p>
      <p align="left">In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the 
        IANA seeks input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, 
        particularly those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has 
        been established to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted 
        in ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Mr. Ciza's longstanding service as administrative contact, 
        working under the auspices of CNI, has demonstrated their commitment to 
        serving the Burundi Internet community. This commitment has been further 
        demonstrated by CNI's willingness to enter into the memorandum of understanding 
        providing formal accountability for its stewardship of the .bi ccTLD. 
        It is also reinforced by the support of the Burundi government.</p>
      <p align="left">As the Internet has grown within Burundi, it is appropriate 
        that a technical contact within Burundi be formally designated, reflecting 
        the shift in technical operations from outside the country to within. 
        The IANA's review indicates that CBINET and Mr. Ndayirukiye possess the 
        technical competence to carry out assignment of domain names and operation 
        of nameservers. The presently listed technical contact, Mr. Gr&eacute;goire 
        has endorsed designation of Mr. Ndayirukiye as technical contact. CNI, 
        which has accepted accountability for the ccTLD under <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/bi/">its 
        memorandum of understanding</a>, has designated Mr. Ndayirukiye as such.</p>
      <p align="left">The shifting of ccTLD delegations from individuals that 
        have been designated informally as administrative and technical contacts 
        to organizations operating under written agreements or memoranda of understanding 
        is a positive step toward the stable and professional operation of ccTLDs 
        in the public interest. As the Internet becomes increasingly important 
        to global society, it is important that a framework of accountability 
        be established for the operation of all top-level domains, both to promote 
        the global interoperability of the domain-name system and to ensure that 
        the interests of local Internet communities are well-served.</p>
      <p align="left">In February 2000, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/">ICANN 
        Governmental Advisory Committee</a> (GAC) issued a document entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>,&quot; 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot; These principles serve 
        as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments in assuming proper 
        roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, which the GAC has 
        observed is a public resource to be administered in the public interest. 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibility 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system. </p>
      <p>The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see clauses <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">5.5</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">9</a>). 
        The GAC Principles recommend that governments and ICANN pursue their respective 
        roles by creating a framework for accountability memorialized in communications 
        with each other and with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). In this case, however, the Burundi government has expressed its 
        support for entry of a bilateral memorandum of understanding between CNI 
        and ICANN. These bilateral arrangements promote the DNS's stable and reliable 
        operation by allowing for accountable operation by the manager, pending 
        appropriate expression by the relevant government or public authority 
        for participation in a triangular arrangement (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/communique-10mar01.htm#B">GAC 
        Melbourne Communiqu&eacute; part B</a> (10 March 2001)). </p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The IANA concludes that the .bi ccTLD should be redelegated, as requested, 
        from the current delegees to Centre National de l'Informatique (CNI). 
        The administrative and technical contacts should be recorded as Victor 
        Ciza and Felix Ndayirukiye, as designated by CNI under its memorandum 
        of understanding with ICANN.</p>
