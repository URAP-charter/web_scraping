	<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. Earlier this year, the IANA received 
        a request for changing the sponsoring organization, administrative contact, 
        and technical contact for the .mw (Malawi) country-code top-level domain 
        (ccTLD). This report gives the findings and conclusions of the IANA on 
        its investigation of that request.</p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></p>
      <p>The .mw ccTLD was first delegated in January 1997 to Mr. Chris Cope Morgan 
        as administrative contact and Robin Mthwanji as technical contact. Mr. 
        Cope Morgan was associated with the Computer Solutions LTD, Blantyre, 
        Malawi. At the time of the initial delegation in 1996, Robin Mthwanji 
        was associated with InterACCESS Communications, located in Blantyre, Malawi.</p>
      <p>In 1998, InterACCESS encountered connectivity difficulties within Malawi, 
        so that the technical contact was changed to Thomas F. Harris of Dover, 
        New Hampshire, USA. Mr. Harris was and is associated with Tarsus Software.</p>
      <p>Soon afterward, Mr. Cope Morgan left Malawi. In June 2000, the IANA received 
        a request from the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA) 
        for information regarding the delegation and the procedures for its redelegation 
        to someone residing within Malawi. MACRA was advised of the provisions 
        of <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#e">ICP-1 section (e)</a> 
        regarding transfers of delegations, and requested to contact Mr. Cope 
        Morgan and Mr. Harris to discuss directly with them a possible transfer 
        of the .mw ccTLD delegation back into Malawi.</p>
      <p>In September 2001, the IANA received a copy of a 12 September 2001 letter 
        from MACRA to Mr. Cope Morgan, then located in South Africa, stating that 
        the Malawi Sustainable Development Network Programme (Malawi SDNP) had 
        MACRA’s mandate to operate the .mw ccTLD. In August 2001, Mr. Cope Morgan 
        had advised Dr. Paulos Nyirenda of the Malawi SDNP that Mr. Cope Morgan 
        was prepared to agree to transfer of the delegation upon receiving documentation 
        of MACRA’s mandate.</p>
      <p>On 10 February 2002, Mr. Cope Morgan wrote to ICANN’s ccTLD Liaison endorsing 
        Dr. Nyirenda as the appropriate administrator of the .mw ccTLD, in view 
        of his greater ability to place the .mw ccTLD on a sound and transparent 
        operational footing. Mr. Cope Morgan stated: “I feel now that Dr Paulos 
        Nyirenda is currently the appropriate administrator and should take it 
        over once all technical issues are resolved.”</p>
      <p>On 1 March 2002, Dr. Nyirenda submitted a request, on behalf of the Malawi 
        SDNP, for the .mw ccTLD to be delegated to it. The request was accompanied 
        by documentation concerning:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the Malawi Internet community and Malawi SDNP’s consultations with 
          it;</li>
        <li> the circumstances affecting the Internet community in Malawi;</li>
        <li>MACRA’s support of Malawi SDNP;</li>
        <li>technical abilities of Malawi SDNP;</li>
        <li>the organizational structure of Malawi SDNP; and</li>
        <li>the vision and contemplated policies under which Malawi SDNP would 
          operate the .mw ccTLD.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> By an accompanying template, Dr. Nyirenda proposed changing the sponsoring 
        organization to Malawi SDNP, the administrative contact to Dr. Nyirenda, 
        and the technical contact to the Malawi SDNP Coordinator, Mr. David Chima. 
        Thus, the effect of the requests was to shift away from out-of-country 
        operation of the .mw ccTLD and to an in-country administrative and technical 
        contact and sponsoring organization.</p>
      <p>The existing administrative and technical contacts have agreed to these 
        changes. Consultations were conducted within Malawi regarding this change, 
        which indicated significant support for Malawi SDNP’s operation of the 
        .mw ccTLD.</p>
      <p>In view of the proposed shift in the delegated authority over the .mw 
        domain, discussions ensued regarding establishing more formal accountability 
        regarding the delegation. As noted above, MACRA endorsed Malawi SDNP as 
        the appropriate party to become the delegate of the .mw ccTLD. On 28 June 
        2002, Malawi SDNP and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
        Numbers entered into a <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/mw/">memorandum 
        of understanding</a> under which Malawi SDNP would assume the responsibilities 
        as delegee. MACRA was formally advised of the parties’ intent to enter, 
        and provided a copy of, this memorandum of understanding on 12 June 2002. 
        Although the memorandum of understanding does not provide for direct involvement 
        of MACRA or another governmental agency in ensuring Malawi SDNP’s accountability, 
        it is subject to being replaced in the future by a more durably binding 
        agreement taking into account evolving circumstances, including possible 
        enhanced, cooperative governmental involvement in ensuring that the ccTLD 
        operates within an appropriate framework of accountability.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Under 
        that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm#sow2.1.1.2">includes</a> 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs, investigating 
        the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">Internet 
        Domain Name System Structure and Delegation</a>&quot; (ICP-1). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC&nbsp;1591</a> 
        (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects subsequent 
        documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA through May 
        1999.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot;</p>
      <p>Based on the materials submitted and the IANA’s evaluation of the circumstances, 
        Malawi SDNP appears well-positioned, and firmly committed, to operate 
        the .mw ccTLD in a manner that serves the Malawi Internet community. Consultations 
        by Malawi SDNP itself show support within the Malawi Internet community 
        for redelegating the .mw ccTLD to Malawi SDNP. Malawi SDNP’s commitment 
        to serving the community is further demonstrated by its willingness to 
        enter into the memorandum of understanding providing formal accountability 
        for its stewardship of the .mw ccTLD. It is also reinforced by the support 
        of the Malawi government.</p>
      <p>Malawi SDNP, which has accepted accountability for the ccTLD under its 
        memorandum of understanding, has designated Mr. Chima as technical contact. 
        The IANA's review indicates that Malawi SDNP, and Mr. David Chima, possess 
        the technical competence to carry out assignment of domain names and operation 
        of nameservers. <br>
        The shifting of ccTLD delegations from individuals that have been designated 
        informally as administrative and technical contacts to organizations operating 
        under written agreements or memoranda of understanding is a positive step 
        toward the stable and professional operation of ccTLDs in the public interest. 
        As the Internet becomes increasingly important to global society, it is 
        important that a framework of accountability be established for the operation 
        of all top-level domains, both to promote the global interoperability 
        of the domain-name system and to ensure that the interests of local Internet 
        communities are well-served.</p>
      <p>In February 2000, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/">ICANN 
        Governmental Advisory Committee</a> (GAC) issued a document entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>,&quot; 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot; These principles serve 
        as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments in assuming proper 
        roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, which the GAC has 
        observed is a public resource to be administered in the public interest. 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibility 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system.</p>
      <p>The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see clauses <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">5.5</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">9</a>). 
        The GAC Principles recommend that governments and ICANN pursue their respective 
        roles by creating a framework for accountability memorialized in communications 
        with each other and with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). In view of local conditions or for other reasons, however, national 
        governments sometimes choose not to be directly involved initially in 
        the three-way communications, but instead to allow bilateral arrangements 
        such as that here to be entered. In such cases, the bilateral agreements 
        promote the DNS's stable and reliable operation by allowing for accountable 
        operation by the manager, pending appropriate expression by the relevant 
        government or public authority for participation in a triangular arrangement 
        (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/communique-10mar01.htm#B">GAC 
        Melbourne Communiqu&eacute; part B</a> (10 March 2001)).</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The IANA concludes that the .mw ccTLD should be redelegated, as requested, 
        from the current delegees to Malawi SDNP. Dr. Paulos B. Nyirenda should 
        become administrative contact and Mr. David Chima should become technical 
        contact, as designated by Malawi SDNP under its memorandum of understanding 
        with ICANN.</p>
