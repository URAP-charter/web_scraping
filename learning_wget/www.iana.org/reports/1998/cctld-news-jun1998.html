      <P><a name="1"></a>1. White Paper - On June 5, 1998, the US government issued 
        the much anticipated &quot;White Paper&quot;, discussing development of 
        the Internet and the necessity for formal governance in regards to operation 
        and coordination of the root servers, coordination of IP addressing, protocol 
        assigning, and domain name development and coordination.</P>
      <P>These tasks will be the responsibility of a new not-for-profit organization, 
        created and supported by the Internet community.&nbsp; As you may know, 
        many of these responsibilties are already under the care of IANA, and 
        the &quot;White Paper&quot; has recognized this, and thus, requests that 
        the new organization include the personnel and expertise of the current 
        IANA.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it is our desire that IANA will develop into this new organization.&nbsp; 
        The current IANA has the necessary expertise as well as solid support 
        from the Internet community to evolve into this new organization.&nbsp; 
        However, your support and input is also needed in this process.&nbsp; 
        Please visit our new website for a more thorough overview of <BR>
        our vision and more information on this subject.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/">http://www.iana.org</A></P>

      <P><a name="2"></a>2. Participation</P>
      <P>One of the best ways to be involved and participate in this new process 
        is to join a regional organization or association of country code administrators.&nbsp; 
        We are encouraging regional groups of administrators to team up and voice 
        their concerns and opinions in this process.&nbsp; Currently, there are 
        two organizations created, CENTR (for Europe administrators) and APCCTLD 
        (for Asia Pacific administrators), and IANA would like to encourage the 
        creation of more regional associations among the TLD administrators.&nbsp; 
        We envision these organizations as important participants in the new IANA.</P>
      <P>Specifically, TLD administrators should be participating in the formation 
        of a Domain Names Council.&nbsp; Tentative plans suggest there will be 
        councils in four areas: names, addresses, protocols, and user and industry.&nbsp; 
        When details of this Council are available, you will be notified via this 
        list.&nbsp; In the interim, please send your comments to <A HREF="mailto:comments@iana.org">comments@iana.org.</A></P>
      <P>We cannot stress enough the importance of your participation in this 
        process and your participation in the new IANA.</P>
      <P>For more information on the involvement of CENTR or APCCTLD, contact:</P>

      <P>The new IANA web site contains a contact template which should be sent 
        to <A HREF="mailto:iana@iana.org">iana@iana.org</A> in order to update 
        any contact information.&nbsp; Much of&nbsp; our contact information is 
        out of date, so we ask you to please send in a template ASAP in order 
        to update our records.</P>
      <P>Thank you.</P>
