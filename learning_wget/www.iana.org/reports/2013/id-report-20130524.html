<h1>Report on the Redelegation of the .ID domain representing Indonesia to Perkumpulan Pengelola Nama Domain Internet Indonesia</h1>

<p>24 May 2013</p>

<p>This report is being provided under the contract for performance of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function between the United States Government and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Under that contract, ICANN performs the “IANA functions”, which include receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning TLDs, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those requests, making its recommendations, and reporting actions undertaken in connection with processing such requests.</p>

<h2>Factual Information</h2>

<h3>Country</h3>
<p>The “ID” ISO 3166-1 code is designated for use to represent Indonesia.</p>

<h3>Chronology of events</h3>

<p>The current sponsoring organisation for the .ID top-level domain is “IDNIC-PPAU Mikroelektronika”, as listed in the IANA Root Zone Database.</p>
<p>In 2005 and 2006, several meetings and discussions took place in Indonesia to determine who the responsible party for the domain name administration in the country should be. By August 2006, a conclusion was reached that an association should be formed to manage the .ID top-level domain. Shortly after, Perkumpulan Pengelola Nama Domain Internet Indonesia (PANDI), the “Indonesia Internet Domain Names Registry Association” in English, was established with the objective of providing Indonesia with the “high level domain name registry service”, amongst other objectives. </p>
<p>PANDI has been responsible for the technical operations of the .ID domain since summer 2007 following a mandate from the government.</p>
<p>On 26 April 2012, a meeting took place where it was decided that two entities — PANDI and the Directorate General of Information Application, Ministry of Communication and Information — would apply to ICANN for a redelegation of .ID ccTLD. On 7 June 2012, a request was sent to ICANN seeking redelegation of the domain to these two entities. ICANN staff informed the applicants that there is no procedure to entrust a top-level domain to two different legal entities at the same time. The applicants discussed which of the two proposed entities should become trustee of the domain, and the application was updated in August with PANDI as the proposed sponsoring organisation.</p>
<p>On 3 October 2012, by the Decision Number 642 Year 2012, the Minister of Communication and Information Technology established the Indonesian Domain Name Forum with the responsibility to create policies in regard to the .ID domain management as well as “control management of the Indonesian domain name”. In accordance with the same decision, the operational process and technical management of the .ID domain has been assigned to PANDI.</p>

<h3>Proposed Sponsoring Organisation and Contacts</h3>

<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation is Perkumpulan Pengelola Nama Domain Internet Indonesia, established on 29 December 2006 as a non-profit association and incorporated as a legal entity shortly after.</p>
<p>The proposed administrative contact is Muhammad Neil El Himam, Deputy Director for Software Standards and Audit with the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. The administrative contact is understood to be based in Indonesia.</p>
<p>The proposed technical contact is Aidil Chendramata, Deputy Director for Cybercrime Investigation &amp; Law Enforcement, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology.</p>

<h2>
    Evaluation of the Request
</h2>
<h3>
    String Eligibility
</h3>
<p>The top-level domain is eligible for continued delegation under ICANN policy, as it is the assigned ISO 3166-1 two-letter code representing Indonesia.</p>
<h3>
    Public Interest
</h3>
<p>Support for the application to redelegate the domain was provided from the Directorate General of ICT Application, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. Additional statements in support of this redelegation were provided from the Indonesian Information Technology Federation (IITF), Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN Indonesia), Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), Indonesian Internet Service Provider Association (APJII), PUSILKOM Universitas Indonesia (UI).</p>
<p>The application is consistent with known applicable local laws in Indonesia.</p>
<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation undertakes to operate the domain in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
<h3>
    Based in country
</h3>
<p>
    The proposed sponsoring organisation is constituted in Indonesia. The proposed administrative contact is understood to be resident in Indonesia. The registry is to be operated in the country.
	
</p>
<h3>
    Stability
</h3>
<p>The request is deemed uncontested, with the currently listed sponsoring organisation consenting to the transfer.</p>
<p>A transfer plan was unnecessary to demonstrate the ability to carry out the necessary responsibilities as PANDI has operated the domain registry since 2007. The applicant stated that “based on the handover in 2007 and a successful PANDI’s operation of the registry system, we believe that we’ve passed the transition period smoothly and without any disruption of service.”</p>
<h3>
    Competency
</h3>
<p>
	The applicant has demonstrated the ability to manage the domain by virtue of its role as de-facto manager since 2007. Policies relating to the ongoing management of the domain have been tendered.
</p>

<h2>
    Evaluation Procedure
</h2>
<p>
    ICANN is tasked with coordinating the Domain Name System root zone as part of a set of functions governed by a
    contract with the U.S. Government. This includes accepting and evaluating requests for delegation and redelegation
    of top-level domains.</p>
<p>A subset of top-level domains are designated for the local Internet communities in countries to operate in a way that
    best suits their local needs. These are known as country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs), and are assigned by ICANN
    to responsible trustees (known as “Sponsoring Organisations”) that meet a number of public-interest criteria for
    eligibility. These criteria largely relate to the level of support the trustee has from its local Internet
    community, its capacity to ensure stable operation of the domain, and its applicability under any relevant local
    laws.</p>
<p>Through ICANN’s IANA department, requests are received for delegating new ccTLDs, and redelegating or revoking
    existing ccTLDs. An investigation is performed on the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and, when
    appropriate, the requests are implemented and a recommendation for delegation or redelegation is made to the U.S.
    National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</p>
</p>
<h3>
    Purpose of evaluations
</h3>
<p>
    The evaluation of eligibility for ccTLDs, and of evaluating responsible trustees charged with operating them, is
    guided by a number of principles. The objective of the assessment is that the action enhances the secure and stable
    operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems.</p>
<p>In considering requests to delegate or redelegate ccTLDs, input is sought regarding the proposed new Sponsoring
    Organisation, as well as from persons and organisations that may be significantly affected by the change,
    particularly those within the nation or territory to which the ccTLD is designated.</p>
<p>The assessment is focussed on the capacity for the proposed sponsoring organisation to meet the following
    criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The domain should be operated within the country, including having its sponsoring organisation and
        administrative contact based in the country.
    </li>
    <li>The domain should be operated in a way that is fair and equitable to all groups in the local Internet
        community.
    </li>
    <li>Significantly interested parties in the domain should agree that the prospective trustee is the appropriate
        party to be responsible for the domain, with the desires of the national government taken very seriously.
    </li>
    <li>The domain must be operated competently, both technically and operationally. Management of the domain should
        adhere to relevant technical standards and community best practices.
    </li>
    <li>Risks to the stability of the Internet addressing system must be adequately considered and addressed,
        particularly with regard to how existing identifiers will continue to function.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Method of evaluation</h3>
<p>
    To assess these criteria, information is requested from the applicant regarding the proposed sponsoring organisation
    and method of operation. In summary, a request template is sought specifying the exact details of the delegation
    being sought in the root zone. In addition, various documentation is sought describing: the views of the local
    internet community on the application; the competencies and skills of the trustee to operate the domain; the legal
    authenticity, status and character of the proposed trustee; and the nature of government support fort he proposal.
    The view of any current trustee is obtained, and in the event of a redelegation, the transfer plan from the previous
    sponsoring organisation to the new sponsoring organisation is also assessed with a view to ensuring ongoing stable
    operation of the domain.</p>
<p>After receiving this documentation and input, it is analysed in relation to existing root zone management procedures,
    seeking input from parties both related to as well as independent of the proposed sponsoring organisation should the
    information provided in the original application be deficient. The applicant is given the opportunity to cure any
    deficiencies before a final assessment is made.</p>
<p>Once all the documentation has been received, various technical checks are performed on the proposed sponsoring
    organisation’s DNS infrastructure to ensure name servers are properly configured and are able to respond to queries
    correctly. Should any anomalies be detected, ICANN staff will work with the applicant to address the issues.</p>
<p>Assuming all issues are resolved, an assessment is compiled providing all relevant details regarding the proposed
    sponsoring organisation and its suitability to operate the relevant top-level domain.</p>
