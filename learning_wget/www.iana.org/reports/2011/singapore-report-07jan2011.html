	<h1>Delegation of the .新加坡 ("Singapore") domain, and the .சிங்கப்பூர் ("Singapore") domain, representing Singapore in Chinese and Tamil</h1>
	<p>ICANN has received a request to delegate the .新加坡 and .சிங்கப்பூர் domains as country-code top-level domains representing Singapore to Singapore Network Information Centre Pte Ltd. ICANN Staff have assessed the request, and provide this report for the ICANN Board of Directors to consider.</p>
	<h2>Factual Information</h2>
	<h3>Country</h3>
	<p>The “SG” ISO 3166-1 code, from which this application's eligibility derives, is designated for use to represent Singapore.</p>
	<h3>Strings</h3>
	<p>The two domains under consideration for delegation at the DNS root level are:</p>
	<ol type="1"><li><p>The string “新加坡”, as represented in ASCII-compatible encoding according to the IDNA specification as “xn--yfro4i67o”. The individual Unicode code points that comprise this string are U+65B0 U+52A0 U+5761. The string is expressed in Chinese script, and in Chinese language, has the meaning and pronunciation of "Singapore".</p></li>
	<li><p>The string “சிங்கப்பூர்”, as represented in ASCII-compatible encoding according to the IDNA specification as “xn--clchc0ea0b2g2a9gcd”. The individual Unicode code points that comprise this string are U+0B9A U+0BBF U+0B99 U+0BCD U+0B95 U+0BAA U+0BCD U+0BAA U+0BC2 U+0BB0 U+0BCD. The string is expressed in Tamil script, and in Tamil language, has the meaning and pronunciation of "Singapore".</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Chronology of events</h3>
	<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation, Singapore Network Information Centre (SGNIC) Pte Ltd, was formed in 1995 to administer the Internet domain space in Singapore. Today it is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore.</p>

	<p>On 31 March 2010, an application was made to the "IDN Fast Track" process to have the strings recognised as representing Singapore.  On 4 June 2010, review by the IDN Fast Track DNS Stability Panel found that "the applied-for strings associated with the applications from [Singapore] (a) present none of the threats to the stability or security of the DNS ... and (b) present an acceptable low risk of user confusion". The request for the strings to represent Singapore were subsequently approved.</p>
	<p>On 28 September 2010, Singapore Network Information Centre Pte Ltd commenced a request to ICANN for delegation of ".新加坡" and ".சிங்கப்பூர்" as top-level domains.</p>
	<h3>Proposed Sponsoring Organisation and Contacts</h3>
	<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation is Singapore Network Information Centre (SGNIC) Pte Ltd, a company incorporated with business registration number 199704146E in Singapore.</p>
	<p>The proposed administrative and technical contact is Lee Han Chuan, the technical manager of SGNIC. The contact is understood to be based in country name.</p>
	<h2>Evaluation of the Request</h2>
	<h3>String Eligibility</h3>
	<p>The top-level domains are eligible for delegation under ICANN policy, as the string has been deemed an appropriate representation of Singapore through the ICANN Fast Track String Selection process, and Singapore is presently listed in the ISO 3166-1 standard.</p>
	<h3>Public Interest</h3>
	<p>The Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore Act confers authority upon the Infocomm Development Authority to "authorise or regulate the registration, administration and management of domain names in Singapore". Leong Keng Thai, Deputy Chief Executive of the Infocomm Development Authority has written in support of the delegation application that "SGNIC has been the ccTLD manager for ".sg" domain names since 1997. With its experience and knowledge in dealing with domain name matters, we fully support SGNIC being the IDN ccTLD manager for the ".新加坡" and ".சிங்கப்பூர்" [strings]".</p>
	<p>The applicant has provided two identically worded letters to represent local Internet community support for the string, one from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, supporting the Chinese string; and from the Tamil Language Council, supporting the Tamil string. The applicant has stated it did not conduct outreach on who or how the domains should be operated, but simply whether they should be operated. The applicant has stated that it "carried out a scan of all associations/societies in Singapore to identify the appropriate communities and entities for public consultation", and settled on one organisation for each string to engage with.</p>
	<p>The application is consistent with known applicable local laws in Singapore.</p>
	<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation undertakes to operate the domain in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
	<h3>Based in country</h3>
	<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation is constituted in Singapore. The proposed administrative contact is understood to be resident in Singapore. The registry is to be operated in the country.</p>
	<h3>Stability</h3>
	<p>The application does not involve a transfer of domain operations from an existing domain registry, and therefore stability aspects relating to registry transfer have not been evaluated.</p>
	<p>The application is not known to be contested.</p>
	<h3>Competency</h3>
	<p>The application has provided satisfactory details on the technical and operational infrastructure and expertise that will be used to operate the proposed new domain. Proposed policies for management of the domain have also been tendered.</p>
	<h2>Evaluation Procedure</h2>
	<p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is tasked with managing the Domain Name System root zone as part of a set of functions governed by a contract with the U.S. Government. This includes managing the delegations of top-level domains.</p>
	<p>A subset of top-level domains are designated for the local Internet communities in countries to operate in a way that best suits their local needs. These are known as country-code top-level domains, and are assigned by ICANN to responsible trustees (known as “Sponsoring Organisations”) who meet a number of public-interest criteria for eligibility. These criteria largely relate to the level of support the trustee has from their local Internet community, their capacity to ensure stable operation of the domain, and their applicability under any relevant local laws.</p>
	<p>Through an ICANN department known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), requests are received for delegating new country-code top-level domains, and redelegating or revoking existing country-code top-level domains. An investigation is performed on the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and, when appropriate, the requests are implemented. Decisions on whether to implement requests are made by the ICANN Board of Directors, taking into account ICANN’s core mission of ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems.</p>
	<h3>Purpose of evaluations</h3>
	<p>The evaluation of eligibility for country-code top-level domains, and of evaluating responsible trustees charged with operating them, is guided by a number of principles. The objective of the assessment is that the action enhances the secure and stable operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems. The evolution of the principles has been documented in “Domain Name System Structure and Delegation” (RFC 1591), “Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation” (ICP-1), and other informational memoranda.</p>
	<p>In considering requests to delegate or redelegate country-code top-level domains, input is sought regarding the proposed new Sponsoring Organisation, as well as from persons and organisations that may be significantly affected by the change, particularly those within the nation or territory to which the ccTLD is designated. </p>
	<p>The assessment is focussed on the capacity for the proposed sponsoring organisation to meet the following criteria:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The domain should be operated within the country, including having its sponsoring organisation and administrative contact based in the country.</li>
	<li>The domain should be operated in a way that is fair and equitable to all groups in the local Internet community.</li>
	<li>Significantly interested parties in the domain should agree that the prospective trustee is the appropriate party to be responsible for the domain, with the desires of the national government taken very seriously.</li>
	<li>The domain must be operated competently, both technically and operationally. Management of the domain should adhere to relevant technical standards and community best practices.</li>
	<li>Risks to the stability of the Internet addressing system must be adequately considered and addressed, particularly with regard to how existing identifiers will continue to function.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Method of evaluation</h3>
	<p>To assess these criteria, information is requested from the applicant regarding the proposed sponsoring organisation and method of operation. In summary, a request template is sought specifying the exact details of the delegation being sought in the root zone. In addition, various documentation is sought describing: the views of the local internet community on the application; the competencies and skills of the trustee to operate the domain; the legal authenticity, status and character of the proposed trustee; and the nature of government support fort he proposal. The view of any current trustee is obtained, and in the event of a redelegation, the transfer plan from the previous sponsoring organisation to the new sponsoring organisation is also assessed with a view to ensuring ongoing stable operation of the domain.</p>
	<p>After receiving this documentation and input, it is analysed in relation to existing root zone management procedures, seeking input from parties both related to as well as independent of the proposed sponsoring organisation should the information provided in the original application be deficient. The applicant is given the opportunity to cure any deficiencies before a final assessment is made.</p>
	<p>Once all the documentation has been received, various technical checks are performed on the proposed sponsoring organisation’s DNS infrastructure to ensure name servers are properly configured and are able to respond to queries for the top-level domain being requested. Should any anomalies be detected, ICANN staff will work with the applicant to address the issues.</p>
	<p>Assuming all issues are resolved, an assessment is compiled providing all relevant details regarding the proposed sponsoring organisation and its suitability to operate the top-level domain being requested. This assessment is submitted to ICANN’s Board of Directors for its determination on whether to proceed with the request.</p>
