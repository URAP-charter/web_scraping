	<h1>Delegation of the .한국 ("Hanguk") domain representing the Republic of Korea in Korean</h1>
	<p>ICANN has received a request to delegate the .한국 domain, a country-code top-level domain representing the Republic of Korea, to the Korean Internet and Security Agency. ICANN Staff have assessed the request, and provide this report for the ICANN Board of Directors to consider.</p>
	<h2>Factual Information</h2>
	<h3>Country</h3>
	<p>The “KR” ISO 3166-1 code, from which this application's eligibility derives, is designated for use to represent the Republic of Korea.</p>
	<h3>String</h3>
	<p>The domain under consideration for delegation at the DNS root level is “한국”. This is represented in ASCII-compatible encoding according to the IDNA specification as “xn--3e0b707e”. The individual Unicode code points that comprise this string are U+D55C U+AD6D.</p>
	<p>In Korean language, the string has a meaning equivalent to “Korea” in English. Its pronunciation in English is transliterated as “Hanguk”. The string is expressed using the Hangul script.</p>
	<h3>Chronology of events</h3>
	<p>In July 2009, the proposed sponsoring organisation, Korea Internet and Security Agency, was formed to "efficient support the enhancement of the communications network", in accordance with Article 52-1 of the Act on Network Utilisation and Data Protection. In its creation, various agencies were placed within the organisation's remit, including the National Internet Development Agency of Korea which had to that time been responsible for the .KR country-code top-level domain.</p>
	<p>In May 2010, an application was made to the "IDN Fast Track" process to have the string “한국” recongised as representing the Republic of Korea. The request was supported by the Korea Communications Commission, and supported by the outcome of a consultation process conducted with various Internet community groups.</p>
	<p>On 16 June 2010, review by the IDN Fast Track DNS Stability Panel found that "the applied-for strings associated with the applications from [the Republic of Korea] (a) present none of the threats to the stability or security of the DNS ... and (b) present an acceptable low risk of user confusion". The request for the string to represent the Republic of Korea was subsequently approved.</p>
	<p>In August 2010, for 5 days KISA conducted an online survey of users of its website, asking "Do you support KISA as the registry for .한국?". KISA reports that of the 581 respondents, 95% answered "Yes" to the question. It further reports it surveyed 32 of its registrars, and 5 "DNS experts", and all agreed it should be the registry.</p>
	<p>On 30 September 2010, the Korea Internet & Security Agency commenced a request to ICANN for delegation of ".한국" as a top-level domain.</p>
	<h3>Proposed Sponsoring Organisation and Contacts</h3>
	<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation is Korea Internet & Security Agency, a company incorporated (registration number 244271-0006001) in the Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p>The proposed administrative contact is Young Wan Ju, Vice President of the Internet Promotion Division of the Korea Internet & Security Agency. The administrative contact is understood to be based in the Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p>The proposed technical contact is Young Jin Suh, Director of the System Management Team of the Korea Internet & Security Agency.</p>
	<h2>Evaluation of the Request</h2>
	<h3>String Eligibility</h3>
	<p>The top-level domain is eligible for delegation under ICANN policy, as the string has been deemed an appropriate representation of the Republic of Korea through the ICANN Fast Track String Selection process, and the Republic of Korea is presently listed in the ISO 3166-1 standard.</p>
	<h3>Public Interest</h3>
	<p>The applicant has not provided any documentation whereby the government has expressed direct support for delegation of this specific domain to the Korea Internet & Security Agency. The applicant has stated that the Government of the Republic of Korea considers it inappropriate to explicitly state its consent to the application. In the application, it has been asserted that Article 2 of the "Act on Internet Address Resources" stipulates that the the Korea Internet & Security Agency is the sole organisation responsible for managing internet addresses in Korea, where Internet addresses is defined as "an information mechanism comprised of numbers, letters or codes, or a combination thereof that allows identification of specific information systems and access thereto on the Internet according to certain communication protocols under international standards", and specifically any IP addresses and domain names. Therefore, the applicant states that governmental support can be implied to fall within this remit.</p>
	<p>Letters of support for the application have been received from the Korea Internet Numbers and Numbers Forum, and the Internet address Dispute Resolution Committee. The applicant has put forward the support of these two organisation, and the results of its surveys in August 2010, as evidence of an appropriate level of community consultation on the proposed operation of the domain.</p>
	<p>The application is consistent with known applicable local laws in the Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation undertakes to operate the domain in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
	<h3>Based in country</h3>
	<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation is constituted in the Republic of Korea. The proposed administrative contact is understood to be resident in the Republic of Korea. The registry is to be operated in the country.</p>
	<h3>Stability</h3>
	<p>The application does not involve a transfer of domain operations from an existing domain registry, and therefore stability aspects relating to registry transfer have not been evaluated.</p>
	<p>The application is not known to be contested.</p>
	<h3>Competency</h3>
	<p>The application has provided satisfactory details on the technical and operational infrastructure and expertise that will be used to operate the proposed new domain. Proposed policies for management of the domain have also been tendered.</p>
	<h2>Evaluation Procedure</h2>
	<p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is tasked with managing the Domain Name System root zone as part of a set of functions governed by a contract with the U.S. Government. This includes managing the delegations of top-level domains.</p>
	<p>A subset of top-level domains are designated for the local Internet communities in countries to operate in a way that best suits their local needs. These are known as country-code top-level domains, and are assigned by ICANN to responsible trustees (known as “Sponsoring Organisations”) who meet a number of public-interest criteria for eligibility. These criteria largely relate to the level of support the trustee has from their local Internet community, their capacity to ensure stable operation of the domain, and their applicability under any relevant local laws.</p>
	<p>Through an ICANN department known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), requests are received for delegating new country-code top-level domains, and redelegating or revoking existing country-code top-level domains. An investigation is performed on the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and, when appropriate, the requests are implemented. Decisions on whether to implement requests are made by the ICANN Board of Directors, taking into account ICANN’s core mission of ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems.</p>
	<h3>Purpose of evaluations</h3>
	<p>The evaluation of eligibility for country-code top-level domains, and of evaluating responsible trustees charged with operating them, is guided by a number of principles. The objective of the assessment is that the action enhances the secure and stable operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems. The evolution of the principles has been documented in “Domain Name System Structure and Delegation” (RFC 1591), “Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation” (ICP-1), and other informational memoranda.</p>
	<p>In considering requests to delegate or redelegate country-code top-level domains, input is sought regarding the proposed new Sponsoring Organisation, as well as from persons and organisations that may be significantly affected by the change, particularly those within the nation or territory to which the ccTLD is designated. </p>
	<p>The assessment is focussed on the capacity for the proposed sponsoring organisation to meet the following criteria:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The domain should be operated within the country, including having its sponsoring organisation and administrative contact based in the country.</li>
	<li>The domain should be operated in a way that is fair and equitable to all groups in the local Internet community.</li>
	<li>Significantly interested parties in the domain should agree that the prospective trustee is the appropriate party to be responsible for the domain, with the desires of the national government taken very seriously.</li>
	<li>The domain must be operated competently, both technically and operationally. Management of the domain should adhere to relevant technical standards and community best practices.</li>
	<li>Risks to the stability of the Internet addressing system must be adequately considered and addressed, particularly with regard to how existing identifiers will continue to function.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Method of evaluation</h3>
	<p>To assess these criteria, information is requested from the applicant regarding the proposed sponsoring organisation and method of operation. In summary, a request template is sought specifying the exact details of the delegation being sought in the root zone. In addition, various documentation is sought describing: the views of the local internet community on the application; the competencies and skills of the trustee to operate the domain; the legal authenticity, status and character of the proposed trustee; and the nature of government support fort he proposal. The view of any current trustee is obtained, and in the event of a redelegation, the transfer plan from the previous sponsoring organisation to the new sponsoring organisation is also assessed with a view to ensuring ongoing stable operation of the domain.</p>
	<p>After receiving this documentation and input, it is analysed in relation to existing root zone management procedures, seeking input from parties both related to as well as independent of the proposed sponsoring organisation should the information provided in the original application be deficient. The applicant is given the opportunity to cure any deficiencies before a final assessment is made.</p>
	<p>Once all the documentation has been received, various technical checks are performed on the proposed sponsoring organisation’s DNS infrastructure to ensure name servers are properly configured and are able to respond to queries for the top-level domain being requested. Should any anomalies be detected, ICANN staff will work with the applicant to address the issues.</p>
	<p>Assuming all issues are resolved, an assessment is compiled providing all relevant details regarding the proposed sponsoring organisation and its suitability to operate the top-level domain being requested. This assessment is submitted to ICANN’s Board of Directors for its determination on whether to proceed with the request.</p>
