      <p><b><a name="A"></a>(A) Progress and Schedule of the Internationalized 
        Domain Name Standard</b> 
      <p>Since 1999, the Internet Engineering Task Force has been working on a 
        standards-track protocol to provide internationalized access to domain 
        names. After a BOF session at the IETF meeting in November 1999, the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/idn-charter.html">Internationalized 
        Domain Name working group</a> was established. Its work resulted in a 
        mechanism known as &quot;Internationalized Domain Names in Applications 
        (IDNA)&quot;, which is reflected in three documents that were <a href="/cctld/iesg-protocol-action-24oct02.txt">approved 
        in October 2002 by the Internet Engineering Steering Group for publication 
        as Requests for Comments</a>:

        for publication</a>.</p>
      <p>One necessary step in the publication process is the assignment of an 
        ACE prefix (&quot;ACE&quot; stands for ASCII Compatible Encoding) for 
        the proposed standard (see Section 5 of &lt;<a href="/cctld/draft-ietf-idn-idna-14.txt">draft-ietf-idn-idna-14.txt</a>&gt;). 
        This assignment is the responsibility of the IANA, which has <a href="/cctld/ietf-announce-30jan03.txt">scheduled 
        the selection of the ACE prefix for 11 February 2003</a>, with a public 
        announcement immediately afterward. The RFC Editor will then assign RFC 
        numbers and take the other steps required to complete its publication 
        process.</p>
      <p><b><a name="B"></a>(B) IDN Registry Implementation Committee</b> 
      <p>The following announcement concerns the IDN Registry Implementation Committee:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Dear Colleagues:</p>
        <p>On behalf of Masanobu Katoh, Chair of the ICANN IDN Committee, and 
          myself, I am writing to give you some information about ICANN's newly-formed 
          Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) Registry Implementation Committee, 
          and to invite the participation of those registries that are currently 
          undertaking operational implementation of the IETF's Internationalized 
          Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) standard.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Purpose of IDN Registry Implementation Committee</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In October, the IESG approved the publication of &quot;Internationalizing 
          Domain Names in Applications&quot; (IDNA) as a standards-track protocol.<a href="#fn1">[1]</a> 
          The focus of domain-name internationalization efforts will now shift 
          from standard setting by the IETF to implementation by the existing 
          TLD registries that will implement the IDNA protocol at the second level 
          and below.</p>
        <p>While IDNA is an exciting development for the DNS, it brings with it 
          significant risks. The DNS functions well in part to due its simplicity 
          of design and well-developed documentation; IDNA represents a new set 
          of complications that must be well understood and accounted for by implementing 
          registries. For example, the IDNA protocol enables the translation of 
          all Unicode code points into unique ASCII strings. It has become clear 
          over the past year that collisions, confusion, and other potentially 
          damaging side-effects will arise if registration of all arbitrary characters 
          available in the Unicode encoding system is permitted. These and other 
          potential problems cannot be solved at the protocol level; they must 
          instead be addressed by registries in their technical implementations 
          and registration policies.</p>
        <p>Because these problems are common to all DNS registries (both gTLD 
          and ccTLD) that choose to implement IDNA, it is essential to have a 
          global forum for registry-level dialogue, consultation, and exchange 
          of information, open to the registries, registrars, and technical experts 
          closest to the issue. Accordingly, in December the ICANN Board directed 
          me, in consultation with Katoh-san, to convene a President's IDN Registry 
          Implementation Committee &quot;to consider and exchange information 
          on ways to resolve the issues associated with implementation of IDN 
          capabilities in existing top level domains.&quot;</p>
        <p>The relevant ICANN Board resolutions can be found at:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>&lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-15dec02.htm#IDNCommittee">http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-15dec02.htm#IDNCommittee</a>&gt;<br>

        </blockquote>
        <p>For the benefit of Internet users everywhere, it is extremely important 
          that the registries pioneering the implementation of IDNA share information 
          and experiences with each other, particularly on issues of common concern, 
          such as the use of character equivalence tables. See, for example, the 
          proposed &quot;Internationalized Domain Names Registration and Administration 
          Guideline for Chinese, Japanese and Korean&quot;, <a href="/cctld/draft-jseng-idn-admin-02.txt">draft-jseng-idn-admin-02.txt</a>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Membership</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Membership in the IDN Registry Implementation Committee is intended 
          for those who are directly involved in the implementation of IDNA (such 
          as registry-level IDN project managers), and several independent IDN 
          technical experts.</p>
        <p>There is a tension between keeping the committee as open as possible, 
          and keeping it small enough to get its work done. Accordingly, I am 
          advising registries of the following guidelines. For gTLD and ccTLD 
          registries, I invite any registry that is currently working to implement 
          IDNA within the next six months to nominate someone at the level of 
          a project or technical manager&nbsp;&#150; in other words, an individual 
          with actual responsibility for IDNA implementation. For the gTLD registrars, 
          I have invited the Registrars Constituency to name two such individuals 
          from among its member registrars. And for technical expertise, I have 
          invited several of the IETF architects of IDNA to join as well.</p>
        <p>Please do let me know if your registry meets these guidelines and wishes 
          to participate; and, if so, the name of the person you wish to rperesent 
          your ccTLD on the Committee.</p>
        <p>To provide continuity and to ensure optimal communications, I have 
          invited Katoh-san to chair the new IDN Registry Implermentation Committee 
          while he continues to chair the IDN Committee, and he has graciously 
          agreed to accept this dual role. He has also requested that I serve 
          on the IDN Registry Implementation Committee, and I am pleased to do 
          so.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Schedule &amp; Methods</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The IDN Registry Implementation Committee will begin immediately. Work 
          will proceed via mailing list and, if needed, the occasional teleconference.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Agenda</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I anticipate that the Committee members will begin by sharing information 
          and plans for registry-level IDN registration and administration policies, 
          including the use of character equivalence tables (such as the CJK guidlines 
          cited above) and the exclusion of certain non-language code point ranges. 
          It is important to emphasize that the committee is not intended to set 
          hard rules for ccTLD registries, but rather to facilitate dialogue and 
          information sharing so that IDNA project managers can educate and learn 
          from each other and develop common solutions to common problems.</p>
        <p>Both Katoh-San and I look forward to working with the ccTLD registry 
          community on these important problems.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions you might have.</p>
