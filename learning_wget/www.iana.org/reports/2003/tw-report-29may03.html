      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. In September 2000, the IANA received 
        a preliminary request for redelegation of the .tw (Taiwan) country-code 
        top-level domain (ccTLD). This report gives the findings and conclusions 
        of the IANA on its investigation of that request.</p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></p>
      <p>The .tw ccTLD registry was established by the IANA in July 1989 and initially 
        delegated to Mr. Wen-Sung Chen, Deputy Director of Computer Center at 
        the Ministry of Education, as administrative contact, and Mr. Chin-Hai 
        Yin, Senior Systems Analyst, as technical contact. In July 1990, the Ministry 
        of Education formed TANet, which among other things assumed operational 
        responsibilities for .tw domain-name registration activities under the 
        .tw ccTLD registry. In March 1994, the Taiwan Network Information Center 
        (TWNIC) was commenced as a two-year experimental project to assume these 
        operational responsibilities for the .tw ccTLD.</p>
      <p>In 1995, Mr. W.S. Chen (who changed jobs to become Associate Professor 
        at the National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology) 
        was replaced as administrative contact by Mr. Chin-Hai Yin. Also in 1995, 
        Mr. Chin-Hai Yin was replaced as technical contact by his colleague, Ms. 
        Erin Chen.</p>
      <p>Beginning in October 1996, TWNIC assumed operational responsibilities 
        for .tw registrations. TWNIC also began its formal process of incorporation. 
        In 1998, the National Information Infrastructure (NII) Task Force determined 
        that the Directorate General of Telecommunications (DGT) would monitor 
        the process of TWNIC's incorporation as a non-profit organization.</p>
      <p>In approximately 1998, Ms. Shih-Chiung Ouyang became the administrative 
        contact and Mr. Nai-Wen Hsu became the technical contact for the .tw ccTLD. 
        (Both were formally employed by the Computer Center at the Ministry of 
        Education.) On 29 December 1999, TWNIC became <a href="http://www.iana.org/cctld/tw/twnic-certificate-19nov02.htm">legally 
        incorporated</a>, with its operation as a corporate body supervised by 
        DGT. Ms. Shih-Chiung Ouyang and Mr. Nai-Wen Hsu were shifted to the employment 
        of TWNIC. In 1999, following TWNIC's incorporation, Vincent WS Chen was 
        appointed as the Executive Director of TWNIC.</p>
      <p>In September 2000, the IANA received a request from Hostmaster TWNIC 
        that the administrative contact be changed from Ms. Shih-Chiung Ouyang 
        to Wen-Sung Chen, likewise of TWNIC. In December 2001, the IANA received 
        a letter from the Directorate General of Telecommunications (DGT), noting 
        that DGT intended to formally recognize &quot;TWNIC as the appropriate 
        entity to hold the delegation of authority by the Internet Corporation 
        for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) for administrative authority of 
        the .tw country code top level domain (ccTLD).&quot;</p>
      <p>TWNIC is the organizational center for national network information in 
        Taiwan. As a neutral and non-profit organization, TWNIC is responsible 
        for the domain-name registrations and IP address allocations in Taiwan. 
        In addition to providing network services, TWNIC's mission includes seeking 
        to assure the healthy and rapid growth of the Internet industry in Taiwan 
        through assistance of industry in promoting Internet use and coordinating 
        the exchange and integration of Internet information services. Additionally, 
        TWNIC coordinates and facilitates activities and cooperation between Taiwan 
        and international Internet-related organizations.</p>
      <p>In a letter dated 11 March 2003, <a href="http://www.iana.org/cctld/tw/chien-to-lynn-11mar03.pdf">DGT 
        wrote to ICANN</a> formally endorsing TWNIC as the appropriate holder 
        of the delegation for the .tw ccTLD. The letter further attached an exchange 
        of letters between DGT and TWNIC, which together specified in detail the 
        arrangements by which DGT and TWNIC would fulfill their respective roles 
        and responsibilities to assure that the .tw registry is operated in the 
        interests of the local Internet community.</p>
      <p>TWNIC and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 
        agreed on language for a sponsorship agreement under which TWNIC would 
        assume the responsibility of as sponsoring organization/delegee of the 
        .tw ccTLD. On 26 March 2003, ICANN and TWNIC entered a <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/tw/">Sponsorship 
        Agreement</a>, which closely parallels the model Sponsorship Agreement 
        ICANN has entered for other ccTLDs involving triangular relationships 
        among ICANN, private-sector sponsoring organizations, and public authorities.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm#C.2.1.1.2">includes 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs</a>, 
        investigating the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and making 
        its recommendations and reporting actions undertaken in connection with 
        processing such requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; 
        (<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1</a>). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</a> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects 
        subsequent documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA 
        through May 1999. Relevant guidance is also provided in the February 2000 
        &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>&quot; 
        issued by the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). (These are 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot;)</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority, and the desires of a government or public authority 
        are a major consideration in connection with any TLD delegation or redelegation.</p>
      <p>Based on the materials submitted and the IANA’s evaluation of the circumstances, 
        TWNIC appears to be an appropriate and technically competent manager for 
        the .tw registry, with broad support from the Taiwan Internet community, 
        including the DGT. TWNIC, as the current sponsoring organization and the 
        employer of the current administrative and technical contacts, has for 
        some time been providing the operational and policy-development functions 
        for the .tw ccTLD. As noted above, DGT has formally endorsed TWNIC as 
        the appropriate delegee for the .tw registry. Additional endorsements 
        gathered in the IANA's investigation also demonstrate that TWNIC enjoys 
        broad support among private-sector participants in the local Internet 
        community.</p>
      <p>Agreement of the present delegees is also a significant factor favoring 
        a redelegation. Here, the present administrative and technical contacts 
        favor changing the delegation to TWNIC.</p>
      <p>As part of its redelegation request, TWNIC provided the IANA with a copy 
        of its intended registration policies. The IANA has reviewed those policies 
        and found them to be consistent with ICP-1 and RFC 1591. TWNIC technical 
        plans and resources are adequate to the likely needs of the .tw ccTLD.</p>
      <p> As noted above, in February 2000 ICANN's GAC issued <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>. 
        These principles serve as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments 
        in assuming proper roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, 
        which the GAC has observed is a public resource to be administered in 
        the public interest.</p>
      <p>In general, the GAC Principles recognize that each government and public 
        authority has the ultimate responsibility within its territory for its 
        national public-policy objectives, but also that ICANN has the responsibility 
        for ensuring that the Internet domain-name system continues to provide 
        an effective and interoperable global naming system. The GAC Principles 
        recommend that governments and ICANN pursue their respective roles by 
        creating a framework for accountability memorialized in communications 
        with each other and with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">clauses 
        5.5</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">9</a>). 
        Among these specific principles, the best practices contemplate that governments 
        will assist in ensuring that the ccTLD manager complies with ICANN polices 
        related to global coordination of the Internet DNS (<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7">clauses 
        9.1.7</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.8">9.1.8</a>).</p>
      <p>TWNIC has committed itself to abide by the GAC Principles, and its responsibilities 
        under clause 9, in a 9 October 2002 communication from TWNIC to DGT. This 
        reaffirms that TWNIC is committed to carrying out its responsibilities 
        for ensuring the interests of the local Internet community are being served. 
        In the case of the .tw ccTLD, DGT has assumed the responsibility for ensuring 
        that TWNIC carries out its local responsibilities within a framework of 
        accountability, openness, and service to the local Internet community. 
        In a letter from DGT to ICANN, DGT has committed to private-sector management 
        of the .tw ccTLD while providing DGT with the ability to intervene should 
        the private sector be unable to fulfill this function. The letter also 
        recognizes the desirability of private-sector technical coordination of 
        the Internet on a global scale, and affirms that DGT &quot;considers ICANN 
        to be the appropriate international entity to oversee the technical coordination 
        of the Internet in a manner that will preserve it as an effective and 
        convenient mechanism for global communication and commerce.&quot;</p>
      <p>According to the design described in its constitution, and the relevant 
        communications, TWNIC is well-suited to be inclusive of, and accountable 
        to, the local Internet community and to operate through appropriate open, 
        transparent, and inclusive processes.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The structure proposed by TWNIC and endorsed by DGT is to have TWNIC 
        undertake management of the .tw ccTLD under appropriate oversight by DGT 
        (concerning national public-policy interests) and ICANN (concerning global 
        technical-coordination interests). This structure is consonant with the 
        principle of private-sector responsibility for technical coordination 
        under which the Internet has flourished. In reviewing the request and 
        in light of (a) DGT's endorsement of TWNIC as the appropriate private-sector 
        manager and (b) TWNIC's&nbsp;entry of a sponsorship agreement embodying 
        an appropriate framework of accountability, the IANA concludes that TWNIC 
        is the appropriate delegee of the .tw ccTLD.</p>
