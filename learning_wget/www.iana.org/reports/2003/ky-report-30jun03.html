      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. This report gives the findings 
        and conclusions of the IANA on its investigation of a request for redelegation 
        of the .ky (Cayman Islands) country-code top-level domain (ccTLD).</p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></p>
      <p>In April 1995, the University of Southern California's Information Sciences 
        Institute (which then performed the IANA functions) approved a request 
        for establishment of the .ky ccTLD. At that time and today, that two-letter 
        code was and is set forth on the ISO 3166-1 list maintained by the ISO 
        3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA) as the approved alpha-2 code for 
        the Cayman Islands.</p>
      <p>Upon its establishment in May 1995, the .ky ccTLD was delegated by Dr. 
        Jon Postel (then in charge of the IANA function at the Information Sciences 
        Institute) to Clint Mole, under Cayman Islands Government employment to 
        be the network manager in the Government's Computer Services, as administrative 
        contact, and Andrew Rubin, as technical contact. At that time, it was 
        Dr. Postel's usual practice to delegate authority and responsibilities 
        regarding ccTLDs to trusted individuals. In December 1995, Mr. Mole left 
        the Cayman Islands Government service. During his employment with the 
        Cayman Islands Government, the Government was not aware that Mr. Mole 
        was serving as the administrative contact for the .ky ccTLD.</p>
      <p>In early 1996, the Cayman Islands Government became aware that Mr. Mole 
        was the administrative contact of the .ky ccTLD. In 1997, the Government 
        sought to have the administrative and technical contact responsibilities 
        handed over to Cable and Wireless Ltd, the exclusive telecommunications 
        provider for the Cayman Islands. The transfer of administrative and technical 
        contact according to the 1996' request was never completed.</p>
      <p>In 1998, Mr. Rubin sought to be relieved from his responsibilities as 
        technical contact for the .ky ccTLD. Mr. Mole was approached by Mr. John 
        Harris, of Domain Name Trust (DNT), who offered to become the technical 
        contact. Mr. Mole signed a contract with DNT that provided for DNT to 
        collect registration revenues and to place a portion into a charitable 
        trust established by Mr. Mole to benefit the Cayman Islands community.</p>
      <p>In February 1999, the Cayman Islands Government sought to have all administrative 
        matters relating to the .ky domain transferred to the Government. Because 
        of the pending relationship Mr. Mole had with DNT, Mr. Mole agreed to 
        transfer the responsibilities to the Government, if it honored the contract 
        with DNT. The Government rejected this proposal because it did not consider 
        the contract with DNT to be in the best interests of the local Internet 
        community.</p>
      <p>During this time, DNT's interest in the contract was transferred to a 
        new company called DNT(KY), which in turn was purchased by a company called 
        Internet Management Services Inc. (IMS). IMS had appointed Mr. Scott Englund 
        to provide the technical contact services.</p>
      <p>In September 2000, the Cayman Islands Government formed the Ministry 
        of Information Technology. In April 2002, the Cayman Islands Legislative 
        Assembly (Parliament) enacted the &quot;Information and Communications 
        Technology Authority Law 2002&quot;. A major provision of the law was 
        the establishment of the Information and Communications Technology Authority 
        (ICTA) as an independent body, governed by a Board of Directors appointed 
        from the community, committed by its terms of reference to regular consultations 
        with all stakeholders. Included in the legislation was a provision giving 
        ICTA sole responsiblity &quot;for the management and control of the top 
        level of the global internet Domain Name System held in trust for the 
        Internet and the Islands&quot;. The Law also stipulated that &quot;any 
        person who, without the written consent of the Authority acts or purports 
        to act as, or hold himself out as being authorized by the Authority to 
        act as&quot; the administrative or technical contact for the .ky domain 
        is guilty of an offense. <br>
        With the passing of this law, Mr. Mole immediately ceased responsibilities 
        as administrative contact of the .ky ccTLD. He notified both the Cayman 
        Islands Government and the IANA that effective immediately, he would no 
        longer handle the administrative contact responsibilities, and such notice 
        was also put on his registration website.</p>
      <p>In May 2002, ICANN received a letter from the Director of Information 
        Technology Strategy Unit, Cayman Islands Government, requesting that, 
        as a result of legislation and the withdrawal of Mr. Mole from serving 
        as administrative contact, the current delegation be changed. The Cayman 
        Islands Government endorsed ICTA as the appropriate delegee for the .ky 
        ccTLD and requested that ICTA be so recognized under a framework based 
        on the &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>&quot; 
        issued in February 2000 by ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot;</p>
      <p>To clarify and document the relative roles and responsibilities of ICTA, 
        the Cayman Islands Government, and ICANN, representatives of the parties 
        have drafted the bilateral communications between each pair of the three 
        parties. As between the Government and ICTA, the Information and Communications 
        Technology Authority Law 2002 is consistent with the GAC Principles. The 
        Cayman Islands Government has also sent ICANN communications recognizing 
        ICANN's role in coordinating the DNS to preserve global interoperability. 
        In June 2003, ICTA expressed its desire to execute the appropriate ccTLD 
        Sponsorship Agreement with ICANN, and on 2 June 2003 the ICANN Board authorized 
        the entry of such an agreement with ICTA.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm#C.2.1.1.2">includes 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs</a>, 
        investigating the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and making 
        its recommendations and reporting actions undertaken in connection with 
        processing such requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; 
        (<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1</a>). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</a> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects 
        subsequent documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA 
        through May 1999. Relevant guidance is also provided in the GAC Principles.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot;</p>
      <p>The presence or absence of mutual agreement of the old and new delegees 
        is a significant factor in determining whether redelegation is appropriate. 
        As stated in ICP-1 (echoing RFC 1591): &quot;In the event of a conflict 
        over designation of a TLD manager, the IANA tries to have conflicting 
        parties reach agreement among themselves and generally takes no action 
        unless all contending parties agree.&quot; Nonetheless, in past circumstances 
        where &quot;the parties involved in proposed delegations or transfers 
        have not been able to reach an agreement[,] the IANA has been required 
        to resolve the matter.&quot;<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> As was observed 
        in the IANA reports on the redelegation of the .ke and the .pn TLDs, characteristically, 
        these circumstances have involved an overwhelming demonstration of relevant 
        support for redelegation,<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> or an overwhelming 
        demonstration of facts that the delegation is appropriate (including when 
        it includes moving the functioning of the TLD in-country) and in the best 
        interests of the local Internet community.<br>
        Shortly after Mr. Mole ceased acting as the administrative and technical 
        contacts for the .ky ccTLD, the IANA received the redelegation request 
        from the Cayman Islands Government. Based on a review of that request 
        and considering Mr. Mole's cessation of carrying out the role of administrative 
        contact it appears clear that the proposal put forth by the Cayman Islands 
        Government, to have the ccTLD managed by ICTA as a non-governmental organization, 
        is well-designed to reflect the needs for developing the .ky ccTLD according 
        to the interests of the Cayman Islands Internet community and to gain 
        its support. From the materials presented, it also clearly appears that 
        ICTA has the ability to operate the .ky ccTLD with technical competence.</p>
      <p>As was the case for .au, .jp, sd, and .ke, as reflected in their respective 
        IANA redelegation reports,<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> the Cayman Islands 
        Government's communications reflect that the proposed delegation to ICTA 
        is based on the principles of private-sector self-regulation of the type 
        that have allowed and will continue to allow the Internet globally to 
        flourish. The proposal set forth by the Cayman Islands Government and 
        ICTA is consonant with the principle of private-sector responsibility 
        for technical coordination of the Internet.</p>
      <p>The GAC Principles serve as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments 
        in assuming proper roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, 
        which the GAC has observed is a public resource to be administered in 
        the public interest. In general, they recognize that each government has 
        the ultimate responsibility within its territory for its national public-policy 
        objectives, but also that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that 
        the Internet domain-name system continues to provide an effective and 
        interoperable global naming system. The GAC Principles recommend that 
        governments and ICANN pursue their respective roles by creating a framework 
        for accountability memorialized in communications with each other and 
        with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">clauses 
        5.5</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">9</a>). 
        Among these specific principles, the best practices contemplate that governments 
        will assist in ensuring that the ccTLD manager complies with ICANN polices 
        related to global coordination of the Internet DNS (<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7">clauses 
        9.1.7</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.8">9.1.8</a>).</p>
      <p>ICTA has committed itself to abiding by the GAC Principles in a 24 April 
        2003 communication from the Cayman Islands Ministry of Planning, Communications, 
        Works &amp; Information Technology to former ICANN CEO Stuart Lynn. In 
        the 24 April letter, the Government of the Cayman Islands has committed 
        to private-sector management of the .ky ccTLD while providing the Government 
        with the ability to intervene should the private sector be unable to fulfill 
        this function. The letter also recognizes the desirability of private-sector 
        technical coordination of the Internet on a global scale, and affirms 
        that the Cayman Islands Government is committed to ICANN and &quot;considers 
        ICANN to be the appropriate international entity to oversee the technical 
        coordination of the Internet in a manner that will preserve it as an effective 
        and convenient mechanism for global communication and commerce.&quot;</p>
      <p>By migrating the delegation of the .ky ccTLD from the responsibility 
        of an individual acting under informal understandings with the IANA to 
        a more formal, legally enforceable, set of arrangements among a delegee 
        organization, the relevant government, and ICANN (which performs the IANA 
        function), the proposed delegation will promote service to the local Internet 
        community and will help assure continued Internet interoperability through 
        the global technical coordination that ICANN was created to provide. In 
        this regard, the recognition the Cayman Islands Government's discussion 
        of the need for close coordination with ICANN is particularly noteworthy.</p>
      <p>According to the relevant communications, ICTA is well-suited to be inclusive 
        of, and accountable to, the Cayman Islands Internet community and to operate 
        through appropriate open, transparent, and inclusive processes.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The structure proposed by ICTA and endorsed by the Cayman Islands Government 
        is to have ICTA undertake management of the .ky ccTLD under appropriate 
        oversight of the Cayman Islands Government concerning the national policy 
        interests. ICTA and the Cayman Islands Government also acknowledge and 
        support ICANN's responsibility for coordinating management of the DNS, 
        including the .ky ccTLD, to safeguard global technical-coordination interests. 
        In reviewing the request and in light of the Cayman Islands Government's 
        endorsement of ICTA as the appropriate private-sector manager, and in 
        view of achievement of agreements documenting the framework of accountability 
        described above, the IANA concludes that the .ky ccTLD should be redelegated 
        to ICTA. </p>
