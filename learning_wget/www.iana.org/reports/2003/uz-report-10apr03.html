      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. This report gives the findings 
        and conclusions of the IANA on its investigation of various requests for 
        redelegation of the .uz (Uzbekistan) country-code top-level domain (ccTLD).</p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></p>
      <p>In April 1995, the University of Southern California's Information Sciences 
        Institute (which then performed the IANA functions) approved a request 
        for establishment of the .uz ccTLD. At that time and today, that two-letter 
        code was and is set forth on the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html">ISO 
        3166-1 list</a> maintained by the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/index.html">ISO 
        3166 Maintenance Agency</a> (ISO 3166/MA) as the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html#sz">approved 
        alpha-2 code for Uzbekistan</a>. This addition to the ISO 3166/MA list 
        occurred in September 1992, after the break-up of the Soviet Union (.su), 
        of which Uzbekistan had been a part.</p>
      <p>Upon its establishment in April 1995, the .uz ccTLD was delegated by 
        Dr. Jon Postel (then in charge of the IANA function at the Information 
        Sciences Institute) to Alex Vostrikov of Tashkent as both administrative 
        and technical contact. At that time, it was Dr. Postel's usual practice 
        to delegate authority and responsibilities regarding ccTLDs to trusted 
        individuals. In August 1999, the administrative and technical contact 
        role was redelegated to Rustam Khamidov, also of Tashkent. Mr. Khamidov 
        established a relationship with a company known as Euracom, with its main 
        office located in Berlin and the relevant operations in Tashkent, through 
        which he handled technical operations for the .uz ccTLD.</p>
      <p>The current redelegation analysis has its roots in competing redelegation 
        requests received by the IANA in 2001, leading to a lengthy process of 
        extensive discussions among those seeking redelegation and various participants 
        within the Uzbekistan Internet community. Those discussions ultimately 
        led to considerable evolution of proposals within the community for the 
        administration of the .uz ccTLD.</p>
      <p>In May 2001, Mr. Khamidov sent a request the IANA for the .uz domain 
        to be redelegated to two individuals affiliated with Euracom, one (Aziz 
        Bektursunov) a citizen of Uzbekistan with an address in Tashkent and the 
        other (Ranier Hartmann Karl) with an address in Berlin. The IANA later 
        learned that Mr. Khamidov was no longer involved with the functioning 
        of the .uz ccTLD.</p>
      <p>While this redelegation request was being investigated, in July 2001, 
        the IANA received a letter from the responsible Uzbekistan Government 
        agency, the Posts and Telecommunications Agency of Uzbekistan, conveying 
        significant dissatisfaction within the Uzbekistan community regarding 
        the manner in which Khamidov/Euracom had been administering the .uz ccTLD. 
        These concerns included failure to ensure the technical security of domain 
        names in the ccTLD; failure to provide an automated database for the ccTLD; 
        lack of defined conditions for the registration of domain names under 
        .uz; and lack of accessibility of the .uz ccTLD administrator. According 
        to the July 2001 letter, these problems complicated the registration of 
        domain names for Uzbekistan users of the Internet, thereby also impeding 
        the development of Internet in Uzbekistan. The Uzbekistan Government requested 
        to the IANA, &quot;as the only international body competent in this sphere,&quot; 
        to assist in finding a resolution to the problem, noting that the solution 
        was to transfer administration of the .uz ccTLD to a local Uzbek organization.</p>
      <p>While stressing the general need for repatriation of the .uz ccTLD, the 
        July 2001 letter did not propose a specific administrator. At the end 
        of January 2002, however, the Posts and Telecommunications Agency of Uzbekistan 
        sent a second letter to the IANA, requesting redelegation of the .uz ccTLD 
        to that governmental agency, with technical operations to be conducted 
        by &quot;high quality Internet operators in the Republic, thus ensuring 
        conditions of competition and equality.&quot;</p>
      <p>This letter prompted further discussions within the Uzbek community and 
        with the IANA, after which the Government of Uzbekistan concluded that 
        a better solution would be to have the .uz ccTLD redelegated to the Computerization 
        and Information Technology Developing Center (Uzinfocom), a non-governmental 
        organization formed in June 2002 with the encouragement of the Uzbekistan 
        Government.</p>
      <p>The respective redelegation requests (by the Euracom-affiliated individuals 
        and by Uzinfocom as supported by the Uzbekistan Government) were sent 
        to the opposite requestors according to IANA procedures, to allow them 
        an opportunity to comment and seek their views.</p>
      <p>The Euracom response on 20 August 2002 asserted that Euracom was always 
        seeking, in its efforts to operate the domain, to &quot;promote Internet 
        development in the Republic of Uzbekistan&quot;, and in that several improvements 
        had been made in recent months to the manner in which the .uz ccTLD was 
        being administered. According to Euracom, &quot;in order to speed up the 
        process of registration in Uzbekistan [in view of local payment practices], 
        Euracom promoted establishing the firm Tomas in Tashkent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
        to [carry] out registration of Uzbek users in the basis of local legislation.&quot; 
        Euracom noted that Tomas had developed relationships with various Uzbekistan 
        Government agencies.</p>
      <p>In a 22 August 2002 comment on Euracom's request for redelegation, the 
        Uzbekistan Government stated that &quot;the Government of the Republic 
        of Uzbekistan officially opposes management of the domain 'UZ' by the 
        company Euracom Equipment GmBH.&quot; The Uzbekistan Government expressed 
        concern over whether Euracom, which was not based in Uzbekistan and not 
        engaged in Internet-related business, had a sufficient sense of what is 
        occurring within Uzbekistan on the development of Internet. In addition, 
        the 22 August 2002 letter asserted that Euracom was not working cooperatively 
        with the relevant government or public authority to protect the interests 
        of the local Internet community (as set forth by <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#4.5">clause 
        4.5 of the Governmental Advisory Committee Principles</a>). The Uzbekistan 
        Government felt that Euracom was seeking to run the domain for the sole 
        purpose of making a profit, as reflected in Euracom’s fee structure and 
        its failure to provide a website in the national Uzbek language, which 
        made it difficult for Uzbekistan Internet users to register the domain, 
        further restraining the development of the Internet in Uzbekistan.</p>
      <p>In a subsequent letter, dated 28 August 2002, the Uzbekistan Government 
        responded to Euracom's 20 August 2002 letter. Responding to Euracom’s 
        claim that it was taking measures to improve the registration of domain 
        names in Uzbekistan through the formation of the company Tomas, the Uzbekistan 
        Government noted that neither Tomas nor Euracom are involved in any other 
        activity, other than domain names registration with in the .uz domain 
        for residents of Uzbekistan. The 28 August 2002 letter explained that 
        the relationships between Uzbekistan Government agencies and Tomas were 
        temporary in effect during the redelegation process only.</p>
      <p>In its 22 August 2002 letter, the Uzbekistan Government noted that continued 
        discussions had resulted in a reformulation of the January 2002 proposal 
        that the .uz ccTLD be operated by a governmental agency. Instead, the 
        government proposed that Uzinfocom, a non-governmental structure, would 
        be the most appropriate organization to administer the ccTLD. Uzinfocom 
        had been formed to carry out the realization of the Program of the Republic 
        of Uzbekistan on the development of computerization, information, and 
        the Internet in the country. The Trustee Committee of the Center consists 
        of representatives of the private and state Internet companies, the international 
        community and organizations, representatives of state bodies, and of foreign 
        and domestic companies. </p>
      <p>After review of several communications from both Euracom and the Uzbek 
        government, and through independent efforts to assess the circumstances, 
        the IANA provisionally concluded that the proposal set forth by the Uzbekistan 
        Government, to have a local non-governmental organization administer the 
        .uz ccTLD, was best for the local Internet community. </p>
      <p>To clarify and document the relative roles and responsibilities of Uzinfocom, 
        the Uzbekistan Government, and ICANN, representatives of the parties have 
        drafted the bilateral communications between each pair of the three parties. 
        An <a href="/cctld/uz/govt-uzinfocom-agmt-18oct02.htm">Uzinfocom-government 
        agreement</a> was entered in October 2002 in accordance with the GAC principles, 
        which the government has used as a guide in proceeding. The Uzbekistan 
        Government has also sent ICANN <a href="/cctld/uz/aripov-to-lynn-22oct02.htm">communications</a> 
        recognizing ICANN's role in coordinating the DNS to preserve global interoperability. 
        In November 2002, <a href="/cctld/uz/akhundjanov-to-lynn-19nov02.htm">Uzinfocom 
        expressed its desire to execute the appropriate ccTLD Sponsorship Agreement 
        with ICANN</a>, and on <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-02dec02.htm#ccTLDAgreementforuz">2 
        December 2002 the ICANN Board authorized the entry of such an agreement 
        with Uzinfocom</a>.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm#C.2.1.1.2">includes 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs</a>, 
        investigating the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and making 
        its recommendations and reporting actions undertaken in connection with 
        processing such requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; 
        (<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1</a>). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</a> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects 
        subsequent documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA 
        through May 1999.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot;</p>
      <p>The presence or absence of mutual agreement of the old and new delegees 
        is a significant factor in determining whether redelegation is appropriate. 
        As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#e">stated in ICP-1</a> 
        (echoing RFC 1591): &quot;In the event of a conflict over designation 
        of a TLD manager, the IANA tries to have conflicting parties reach agreement 
        among themselves and generally takes no action unless all contending parties 
        agree.&quot; Nonetheless, in past circumstances where &quot;the parties 
        involved in proposed delegations or transfers have not been able to reach 
        an agreement[,] the IANA has been required to resolve the matter.&quot;<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
        As was observed in the IANA reports on the redelegation of the .ke and 
        the .pn TLDs, characteristically, these circumstances have involved an 
        overwhelming demonstration of relevant support for redelegation,<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> 
        or an overwhelming demonstration of facts that the delegation is appropriate 
        (including when it includes moving the functioning of the TLD in-country) 
        and in the best interests of the local Internet community.</p>
      <p>Shortly after Mr. Khamidov ceased acting as the administrative and technical 
        contacts for the .uz ccTLD, the IANA received competing requests for redelegation 
        from the Euracom-affiliated individuals and the Uzbekistan Government. 
        After discussion among affected interests within Uzbekistan, the Government's 
        request was reformulated to change the proposed delegee from a Government 
        agency to Uzinfocom, a non-governmental structure. According to the procedure 
        described above, the IANA encouraged the contending parties to engage 
        on each other's positions, but this did not result in achievement of agreement.</p>
      <p>In view of the lack of agreement, the IANA was required to resolve the 
        competing requests by the parties to assume the delegation. Based on a 
        review of the responses of the parties, it appears clear that the reformulated 
        proposal put forth by the Uzbekistan Government, to have the ccTLD managed 
        by Uzinfocom as a non-governmental organization, is better designed to 
        reflect the needs for developing the .uz ccTLD according to the interests 
        of the Uzbekistan Internet community and to gain its support. From the 
        materials presented, it also clearly appears that Uzinfocom has the ability 
        to operate the .uz ccTLD with technical competence.</p>
      <p>As was the case for .au, .jp, sd, and .ke, as reflected in their respective 
        IANA redelegation reports,<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> the Uzbekistan 
        Government's communications reflect that the proposed delegation to Uzinfocom 
        is based on the principles of private-sector self-regulation of the type 
        that have allowed and will continue to allow the Internet globally to 
        flourish. The proposal set forth by the Uzbekistan Government and Uzinfocom 
        is consonant with the principle of private-sector responsibility for technical 
        coordination of the Internet.</p>
      <p>In February 2000, the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) issued 
        a document entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>,&quot; 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot; These principles serve 
        as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments in assuming proper 
        roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, which the GAC has 
        observed is a public resource to be administered in the public interest. 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibility 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system. The GAC Principles recommend that governments and ICANN pursue 
        their respective roles by creating a framework for accountability memorialized 
        in communications with each other and with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">clauses 
        5.5</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">9</a>). 
        Among these specific principles, the best practices contemplate that governments 
        will assist in ensuring that the ccTLD manager complies with ICANN polices 
        related to global coordination of the Internet DNS (<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7">clauses 
        9.1.7</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.8">9.1.8</a>).</p>
      <p>Uzinfocom has committed itself to abiding by the GAC principles, and 
        its responsibilities under clause 9, as confirmed in a 18 October 2002 
        communication from Uzinfocom to the Deputy Prime-minister of the Republic 
        of Uzbekistan. In a <a href="/cctld/uz/aripov-to-lynn-22oct02.htm">letter 
        from the Deputy Prime Minister to ICANN</a>, the Government of Uzbekistan 
        has committed to private-sector management of the .uz ccTLD while providing 
        the Government with the ability to intervene should the private sector 
        be unable to fulfill this function. The letter also recognizes the desirability 
        of private-sector technical coordination of the Internet on a global scale, 
        and affirms that the Uzbekistan Government is committed to ICANN and &quot;considers 
        ICANN to be the appropriate international entity to oversee the technical 
        coordination of the Internet in a manner that will preserve it as an effective 
        and convenient mechanism for global communication and commerce.&quot;</p>
      <p>By migrating the delegation of the .uz ccTLD from the responsibility 
        of an individual acting under informal understandings with the IANA to 
        a more formal, legally enforceable, set of arrangements among a delegee 
        organization, the relevant government, and ICANN (which performs the IANA 
        function), the proposed delegation will promote service to the local Internet 
        community and will help assure continued Internet interoperability through 
        the global technical coordination that ICANN was created to provide. In 
        this regard, the recognition the <a href="/cctld/uz/aripov-to-lynn-22oct02.htm#1">Uzbekistan 
        Government's discussion of the need for close coordination</a> between 
        ICANN and the government is particularly noteworthy.</p>
      <p>According to the relevant communications, Uzinfocom is well-suited to 
        be inclusive of, and accountable to, the Uzbekistan Internet community 
        and to operate through appropriate open, transparent, and inclusive processes.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The structure proposed by Uzinfocom and endorsed by the Uzbekistan Government 
        is to have Uzinfocom undertake management of the .uz ccTLD under appropriate 
        oversight of the Uzbekistan Government concerning the national policy 
        interests. Uzinfocom and the Uzbekistan Government also acknowledge and 
        support ICANN's responsibility for coordinating management of the DNS, 
        including the .uz ccTLD, to safeguard global technical-coordination interests. 
        In reviewing the request and in light of the Uzbekistan Government's endorsement 
        of Uzinfocom as the appropriate private-sector manager, and in view of 
        achievement of agreements documenting the framework of accountability 
        described above, the IANA concludes that the .uz ccTLD should be redelegated 
        to Uzinfocom. </p>
