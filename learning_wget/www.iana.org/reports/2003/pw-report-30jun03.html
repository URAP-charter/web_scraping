      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. This report gives the findings 
        and conclusions of the IANA on its investigation of various requests for 
        redelegation of the .pw (Palau) country-code top-level domain (ccTLD).</p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></p>
      <p>In 1997, the University of Southern California's Information Sciences 
        Institute (which then performed the IANA functions) approved a request 
        for establishment of the .pw ccTLD. At that time and today, that two-letter 
        code was and is set forth on the ISO 3166-1 list maintained by the ISO 
        3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA) as the approved alpha-2 code for 
        Palau.</p>
      <p>Upon its establishment in May 1997, the .pw ccTLD was delegated by Dr. 
        Jon Postel (then in charge of the IANA function at the Information Sciences 
        Institute) to Rakel Kamigaki, of PW Domain Registry, as administrative 
        contact, and Hostmaster, of NetNames as the technical contact. At that 
        time, it was Dr. Postel's usual practice to delegate authority and responsibilities 
        regarding ccTLDs to trusted individuals.</p>
      <p>In late 2002, ICANN received an expression of interest to redelegate 
        the .pw ccTLD to the Micronesia Investment &amp; Development Corporation 
        (MIDCORP). The request was supported by the Palau Government. The Palau 
        Government, through the Palau National Communications Corporation, recognized 
        MIDCORP as the appropriate delegee for the .pw ccTLD and expressed an 
        interest to have MIDCORP formally recognized by ICANN as the delegee for 
        the .pw ccTLD according to the &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>&quot; 
        issued in February 2000 by ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot;MIDCORP is an independent 
        body, active within the local Internet community. </p>
      <p>The existing administrative contact has expressed support for the redelegation 
        request, and the listed technical contact has stated that it has no objection.</p>
      <p>To clarify and document the relative roles and responsibilities of MIDCORP, 
        the Palau Government, and ICANN, representatives of the parties have drafted 
        the bilateral communications between each pair of the three parties. A 
        MIDCORP-ICANN Agreement was entered in June 2003 in accordance with the 
        GAC Principles, which the Palau Government has used as a guide in proceeding. 
        The Palau Government has also sent ICANN communications recognizing ICANN's 
        role in coordinating the DNS to preserve global interoperability. In June 
        2003, MIDCORP expressed its desire to execute the appropriate ccTLD Sponsorship 
        Agreement with ICANN, and on 2 June 2003 the ICANN Board authorized the 
        entry of such an agreement with MIDCORP.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm#C.2.1.1.2">includes 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs</a>, 
        investigating the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and making 
        its recommendations and reporting actions undertaken in connection with 
        processing such requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; 
        (<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1</a>). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</a> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects 
        subsequent documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA 
        through May 1999. Relevant guidance is also provided in the GAC Principles.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot;</p>
      <p>Based on the materials submitted and the IANA's evaluation of the circumstances, 
        MIDCORP qualifies as an appropriate manager for the .pw registry, with 
        support from the Palau Internet community, including the Palau Government. 
        As noted above, the government of Palau has formally endorsed MIDCORP 
        as the appropriate delegee for the .pw registry.</p>
      <p>Mutual agreement of the old and the new delegees is also of importance. 
        Here, the former administrative contact supports the change in delegation 
        and the technical contact has stated it has no objection.</p>
      <p>The GAC Principles serve as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments 
        in assuming proper roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, 
        which the GAC has observed is a public resource to be administered in 
        the public interest. In general, they recognize that each government has 
        the ultimate responsibility within its territory for its national public-policy 
        objectives, but also that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that 
        the Internet domain-name system continues to provide an effective and 
        interoperable global naming system. The GAC Principles recommend that 
        governments and ICANN pursue their respective roles by creating a framework 
        for accountability memorialized in communications with each other and 
        with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">clauses 
        5.5</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">9</a>). 
        Among these specific principles, the best practices contemplate that governments 
        will assist in ensuring that the ccTLD manager complies with ICANN polices 
        related to global coordination of the Internet DNS (<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7">clauses 
        9.1.7</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.8">9.1.8</a>).</p>
      <p>MIDCORP has committed itself to abiding by the GAC Principles in a 13 
        May 2003 communication from the Palau Government, Office of the President, 
        to ICANN CEO Paul Twomey. In the 13 May letter, the Government of Palau 
        has followed the actions of the Governments of Australia<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, 
        Japan<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>, Kenya<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>, 
        and the Sudan<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> in committing to the principles 
        of private-sector self-regulation of the type that have allowed and will 
        continue to allow the Internet globally to flourish, while providing the 
        Government with the ability to intervene should the private sector be 
        unable to fulfill this function. The Palau Government's letter also recognizes 
        the desirability of private-sector technical coordination of the Internet 
        on a global scale, and affirms that the Palau Government is committed 
        to ICANN and &quot;considers ICANN to be the appropriate international 
        entity to oversee the technical coordination of the Internet in a manner 
        that will preserve it as an effective and convenient mechanism for global 
        communication and commerce.&quot;</p>
      <p>By migrating the delegation of the .pw ccTLD from the responsibility 
        of an individual acting under informal understandings with the IANA to 
        a more formal, legally enforceable, set of arrangements among a delegee 
        organization, the relevant government, and ICANN (which performs the IANA 
        function), the proposed delegation will promote service to the local Internet 
        community and will help assure continued Internet interoperability through 
        the global technical coordination that ICANN was created to provide. In 
        this regard, the recognition the Palau Government's discussion of the 
        need for close coordination between ICANN and the government is particularly 
        noteworthy.</p>
      <p>According to the relevant communications, MIDCORP is well-suited to be 
        inclusive of, and accountable to, the Palau Internet community and to 
        operate through appropriate open, transparent, and inclusive processes.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The structure proposed by MIDCORP and endorsed by the Palau Government 
        is to have MIDCORP undertake management of the .pw ccTLD under appropriate 
        oversight of the Palau Government concerning the national policy interests. 
        MIDCORP and the Palau Government also acknowledge and support ICANN's 
        responsibility for coordinating management of the DNS, including the .pw 
        ccTLD, to safeguard global technical-coordination interests. In reviewing 
        the request and in light of the Palau Government's endorsement of MIDCORP 
        as the appropriate private-sector manager, and in view of achievement 
        of agreements documenting the framework of accountability described above, 
        the IANA concludes that the .pw ccTLD should be redelegated to MIDCORP.</p>
