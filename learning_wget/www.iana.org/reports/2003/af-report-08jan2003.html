      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. On 10 September 2002, the IANA 
        received a request for redelegation of the .af (Afghanistan) country-code 
        top-level domain (ccTLD). This report gives the findings and conclusions 
        of the IANA on its investigation of that request.</p>
      <p><b><font size="+1"><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual 
        and Procedural Background</font></b></p>
      <p>The .af ccTLD registry was first delegated by the IANA in October 1997 
        to Mr. Abdul Razeeq of Kabul as administrative contact and Hostmaster, 
        NetNames of London as technical contact.</p>
      <p>By arrangement with the IANA, NetNames agreed to perform the technical 
        functions and to provide a free registration service for .af on a temporary 
        basis, until a stable registry operation could be established within Afghanistan. 
      </p>
      <p>In the late 1990s, the ongoing civil war in Afghanistan made Mr. Razeeq's 
        role as administrative contact increasingly difficult. In light of the 
        situation inside Afghanistan, NetNames, in consultation with the IANA, 
        halted the registration of new domain names in the .af registry, while 
        agreeing to continue to make nameserver updates and to provide DNS resolution 
        for the .af zone.</p>
      <p>By early 2000, however, it had become impossible for NetNames or the 
        IANA to contact Mr. Razeeq. Despite numerous attempts by e-mail, telephone, 
        and postal mail over a sustained period of time, the IANA was unable to 
        confirm whether or not Mr. Razeeq was still inside Afghanistan or, for 
        that matter, alive. At the time, the ongoing civil war made communications 
        into Afghanistan extremely difficult. In August 2001, the Taliban, the 
        then-ruling regime, <a href="/cctld/af/taliban-decree-25aug01.htm">formally 
        prohibited all non-governmental Internet use</a> inside the country.</p>
      <p>On 13 November 2001, the Taliban military forces deserted Kabul, Afghanistan's 
        capital. After United Nations-sponsored talks in Bonn, Germany, among 
        Afghan groups opposing the Taliban, an <a href="http://www.uno.de/frieden/afghanistan/talks/agreement.htm">Interim 
        Authority was established on 22 December 2001</a>. On 31 December 2001, 
        the IANA was contacted by Mr. Lawrence Yeung, Chief of the Office of Information 
        Systems and Technology of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 
        which had been charged by the United Nations to assist the Interim Authority 
        of Afghanistan. Mr. Yeung stated that, with the approval of the Afghan 
        Interim Authority, the UNDP would undertake to assume the administration 
        of the .af registry. There is a near-total absence of a local Internet 
        community within Afghanistan&nbsp;&#150; at the time of Mr. Yeung’s inquiry, 
        only a few Internet links had been established in Kabul by international 
        organizations and NGOs. The IANA was, however, rapidly able to confirm 
        that the UNDP had the full backing of the Interim Authority to restore 
        the .af registry to active status and to perform all necessary technical 
        functions, with the understanding that the UNDP's role would be transitional 
        and temporary. The UNDP agreed that its role would be to restore DNS service, 
        to build technical and administrative capacity within Afghanistan, and 
        to shift technical operations to a community-based management structure 
        inclusive of multiple sectors within Afghanistan when feasible and appropriate.</p>
      <p>Over the following months, the IANA worked with UNDP staff to explain 
        the technical and administrative requirements for a ccTLD registry, and 
        to prepare the necessary technical, administrative, and policy arrangements.</p>
      <p>In June 2002, the Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan assumed 
        governmental responsibility from the Interim Authority. On 10 September 
        2002, the Minister of Communications of the Islamic Transitional Government 
        of Afghanistan and the UNDP jointly communicated to the IANA a package 
        of redelegation documents, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <a href="/cctld/af/stanekzai-to-iana-10aug02.pdf">cover letter</a> 
          (dated 10 August 2002) from Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, Minister of Communications 
          of the Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan;</li>
        <li>a <a href="/cctld/af/internet-community-description-10aug02.htm">description 
          of the Afghan Internet community</a>, and the government's plans to 
          achieve Internet access;</li>
        <li><a href="/cctld/af/technical-documentation-10aug02.htm">technical 
          documentation</a>;</li>
        <li>a <a href="/cctld/af/af-vision-10aug02.htm">vision for the .af ccTLD</a>, 
          including agreed plans for <a href="/cctld/af/registration-policy-10aug02.htm">registry 
          administration and registration policies</a>; and</li>
        <li>a <a href="/cctld/af/razeeq-letter-13aug02.pdf">signed letter from 
          Mr. Abdul Razeeq</a>, the original administrative contact, agreeing 
          with the proposed redelegation. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>By accompanying template, the redelegation request proposed to change 
        the sponsoring organization to the Ministry of Communications, the administrative 
        contact to the Minister of Communications, and the technical contact to 
        Mr. Marc Lepage of the UNDP, with the UNDP maintaining the authoritative 
        nameservers and registration website for .af on the interim basis described 
        above.</p>
      <p>The proposal specified that the .af registry would have an oversight 
        committee consisting of the Minister of Communications, the UNDP Afghanistan 
        Country Director, the technical contact (Mr. Lepage), and representatives 
        of the user community. In the submitted documentation, the Ministry and 
        the UNDP have each undertaken to perform a detailed set of administrative 
        and technical responsibilities in service to the emerging Afghan Internet 
        community. </p>
      <p>In accord with the proposed interim arrangements, as described above, 
        the Ministry of Communications and the Internet Corporation for Assigned 
        Names and Numbers (ICANN) have agreed on the language of a <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/af/">Memorandum 
        of Understanding</a> providing a framework of accountability under which 
        the Ministry would assume the responsibilities as the delegee entrusted 
        with the .af registry. On 18 November 2002, the ICANN Board of Directors 
        authorized the entry of this Memorandum of Understanding, which closely 
        parallels prior MoUs entered for the <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/bi/">.bi</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/la/">.la</a>, and <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/mw/">.mw</a> 
        ccTLDs, with the Ministry.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a><font size="+1">Evaluation</font></b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm#sow2.1.1.2">includes</a> 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs, investigating 
        the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">Internet 
        Domain Name System Structure and Delegation</a>&quot; (ICP-1). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC&nbsp;1591</a> 
        (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects subsequent 
        documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA through May 
        1999.</p>
      <p>Here, the Ministry of Communications’s request is to shift the delegation 
        from an individual (as the current administrative contact) and the hostmaster 
        at a company in the United Kingdom (as technical contact) to the Ministry 
        itself. The Ministry will initially obtain the technical assistance of 
        UNDP, with the plan later to transfer the technical operations to an appropriate 
        policy-development and management structure that is inclusive of the various 
        segments of the Afghan Internet community.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot; 
        Here, the government’s support is plain, since it has requested the redelegation.</p>
      <p>Mutual agreement of the old and new delegees is also a significant factor 
        favoring a redelegation. Here, both present delegees (Abdul Razeeq as 
        administrative contact and Hostmaster, Netnames as technical contact) 
        as well as the proposed new delegee (the Ministry) favor the change in 
        delegation.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Communications appears well-positioned to serve as the 
        delegee responsible for the challenging task of reactivating the .af ccTLD. 
        ccTLDs have been established to facilitate and promote the spread of the 
        Internet globally. They are delegated to designated managers, who operate 
        the ccTLDs according to local policies that are adapted to best meet the 
        economic, cultural, linguistic, and legal circumstances of the country 
        or territory involved. The Ministry is sensitive to the particular circumstances 
        of Afghanistan and has placed a priority on the development of the Internet 
        within Afghanistan as appropriate in the context of those circumstances. 
        As the situation in Afghanistan stabilizes, the Ministry is well-suited 
        to work with the local Internet community as it matures to evolve the 
        .af ccTLD toward a robust, inclusive policy-development and management 
        structure.</p>
      <p>The Ministry's proposed technical partner, the <a href="http://www.undp.org/">UNDP</a>, 
        has an impressive technical infrastructure, including long experience 
        in running DNS services. The UNDP's network spans every kind of Internet 
        environment, from the most advanced to the most rudimentary, from the 
        United Nations headquarters in New York to 166 countries around the globe. 
        Though it is generally preferable for a ccTLD to have its technical operations 
        inside the country or territory, that is not an option for Afghanistan 
        at the moment. As the Ministry of Communications stated in its redelegation 
        request: &quot;After a long period of unrest and destruction, Afghanistan’s 
        infrastructure has been left gravely crippled.&quot; At the moment, the 
        appropriate focus is on the restoration of service to the Afghan Internet 
        community, subject to the understanding that technical operations will 
        be shifted into Afghanistan in the future.</p>
      <p>The shifting of ccTLD delegations from individuals operating informally 
        as administrative and technical contacts to organizations operating under 
        written agreements or memoranda of understanding is a positive step toward 
        the stable and professional operation of ccTLDs in the public interest. 
        As the Internet becomes increasingly important to global society, a framework 
        of accountability should develop for the operation of all top-level domains, 
        both to promote the global interoperability of the domain-name system 
        and to ensure that the interests of local Internet communities are well-served.</p>
      <p>In February 2000, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/">ICANN 
        Governmental Advisory Committee</a> (GAC) issued a document entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>,&quot; 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot; These principles serve 
        as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments in assuming proper 
        roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, which the GAC has 
        observed is a public resource to be administered in the public interest. 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibility 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system.</p>
      <p>In entering the MoU and framework of accountability with ICANN, the Ministry 
        of Communications will formally assume responsibility for national public-policy 
        aspects of the .af ccTLD with a commitment to proceeding with openness 
        and service to the local Internet community, while acknowledging the importance 
        of ICANN's role in coordinating an effective and interoperable global 
        domain-name system. Clarification of this allocation of responsibility 
        is an added benefit of the shifting of the delegation to the Ministry.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a><font size="+1">Conclusion</font></b></p>
      <p>The IANA concludes that the .af ccTLD should be redelegated, as requested, 
        from the current delegees to the Ministry of Communications of the Islamic 
        Transitional Government of Afghanistan. Mohammad Masoom Stanakzai, in 
        his capacity as Minister of Communications, should become administrative 
        contact and Marc Lepage of the UNDP should become technical contact, as 
        designated by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
