      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the domain-name system root, is 
        responsible for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of 
        top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent to those 
        requests, and reporting on the requests. This report gives the findings 
        and conclusions of the IANA on its investigation of a request for redelegation 
        of the .tj (Tajikistan) country-code top-level domain (ccTLD).</p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></p>
      <p>In 1997, the University of Southern California's Information Sciences 
        Institute (which then performed the IANA functions) approved a request 
        for establishment of the .tj ccTLD. At that time and today, that two-letter 
        code was and is set forth on the ISO 3166-1 list maintained by the ISO 
        3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA) as the approved alpha-2 code for 
        Tajikistan.</p>
      <p>Upon its establishment in May 1997, the .tj ccTLD was delegated by Dr. 
        Jon Postel (then in charge of the IANA function at the Information Sciences 
        Institute) to Irage M. Tursoon-Zadeh, of TJ Network Services of Fresno, 
        California USA, as administrative contact, and William Walsh, of ProNet 
        Domains as the technical contact. At that time, it was Dr. Postel's usual 
        practice to delegate authority and responsibilities regarding ccTLDs to 
        trusted individuals. The technical contact role was subsequently moved 
        to Karl Watts, located in Fresno, California USA.</p>
      <p>On 13 June 2002, the Chief of the IT Division of the Government of Tajikistan, 
        Timur Hasanov, wrote to ICANN seeking to move the administration of the 
        .tj ccTLD to the Information Technical Center (ITC) into Tajikistan. The 
        Government's request sought redelegation according to &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>&quot; 
        issued in February 2000 by ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot; The ITC is an independent 
        body, active with the local Internet community. The Government's request 
        to move the administration of .tj into Tajikistan was supported by members 
        of the local Internet community and the administrative contact, Irage 
        M. Tursoon-Zadeh. The technical contact, who has not had a cooperative 
        relationship with the administrative contact, did not respond to inquires 
        from the IANA on the redelegation request. Presently none of the designated 
        nameservers provides authoritative answers for the .tj domain.</p>
      <p>To clarify and document the relative roles and responsibilities of ITC, 
        the Tajikistan Government, and ICANN, representatives of the parties have 
        drafted the bilateral communications between each pair of the three parties. 
        An ITC-ICANN Agreement was entered in June 2003 in accordance with the 
        GAC Principles. The Tajikistan Government has also sent ICANN communications 
        recognizing ICANN's role in coordinating the DNS to preserve global interoperability. 
        In June 2003, ITC expressed its desire to execute the appropriate ccTLD 
        Sponsorship Agreement with ICANN, and on 2 June 2003 the ICANN Board authorized 
        the entry of such an agreement with ITC.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-17mar03.htm#C.2.1.1.2">includes 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs</a>, 
        investigating the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and making 
        its recommendations and reporting actions undertaken in connection with 
        processing such requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; 
        (<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">ICP-1</a>). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</a> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects 
        subsequent documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA 
        through May 1999. Relevant guidance is also provided in the GAC Principles.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot;</p>
      <p>Based on the materials submitted and the IANA’s evaluation of the circumstances, 
        ITC qualifies as an appropriate manager for the .tj registry, with support 
        from the Tajikistan Internet community, including the Tajikistan Government. 
        As noted above, the Government of Tajikistan has formally endorsed MIDCORP 
        as the appropriate delegee for the .tj registry.</p>
      <p>In considering redelegation requests, mutual agreement of the old and 
        the new delegees is also of importance, and here the former administrative 
        contact supports the change in delegation. The technical contact has not 
        responded to the IANA's inquires concerning his position on the redelegation 
        request.</p>
      <p>The GAC Principles serve as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments 
        in assuming proper roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, 
        which the GAC has observed is a public resource to be administered in 
        the public interest. In general, they recognize that each government has 
        the ultimate responsibility within its territory for its national public-policy 
        objectives, but also that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that 
        the Internet domain-name system continues to provide an effective and 
        interoperable global naming system. The GAC Principles recommend that 
        governments and ICANN pursue their respective roles by creating a framework 
        for accountability memorialized in communications with each other and 
        with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">clauses 
        5.5</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">9</a>). 
        Among these specific principles, the best practices contemplate that governments 
        will assist in ensuring that the ccTLD manager complies with ICANN polices 
        related to global coordination of the Internet DNS (<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7">clauses 
        9.1.7</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.8">9.1.8</a>).</p>
      <p>ITC has committed itself to abide by the GAC Principles, in the 13 May 
        2003 communication from the Tajikistan Government to ICANN CEO Paul Twomey. 
        In that letter, the Government of Tajikistan has followed the actions 
        of the Governments of Australia<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, Japan<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>, 
        Kenya<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and the Sudan<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
        in committing to the principles of private-sector self-regulation of the 
        type that have allowed and will continue to allow the Internet globally 
        to flourish, while providing the Tajikistan Government with the ability 
        to intervene should the private sector be unable to fulfill this function. 
        The letter also recognizes the desirability of private-sector technical 
        coordination of the Internet on a global scale, and affirms that the Tajikistan 
        Government is committed to ICANN and &quot;considers ICANN to be the appropriate 
        international entity to oversee the technical coordination of the Internet 
        in a manner that will preserve it as an effective and convenient mechanism 
        for global communication and commerce.&quot;</p>
      <p>By migrating the delegation of the .tj ccTLD from the responsibility 
        of individuals acting under informal understandings with the IANA to a 
        more formal, legally enforceable, set of arrangements among a delegee 
        organization, the relevant government, and ICANN (which performs the IANA 
        function), the proposed delegation will promote service to the local Internet 
        community and will help assure continued Internet interoperability through 
        the global technical coordination that ICANN was created to provide. In 
        this regard, the recognition the Tajikistan Government’s discussion of 
        the need for close coordination between ICANN and the Government is particularly 
        noteworthy.</p>
      <p>According to the relevant communications, ITC is well-suited to be inclusive 
        of, and accountable to, the Tajikistan Internet community and to operate 
        through appropriate open, transparent, and inclusive processes.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The structure proposed by ITC and endorsed by the Tajikistan Government 
        is to have ITC undertake management of the .tj ccTLD under appropriate 
        oversight of the Tajikistan Government concerning the national policy 
        interests. ITC and the Tajikistan Government also acknowledge and support 
        ICANN's responsibility for coordinating management of the DNS, including 
        the .tj ccTLD, to safeguard global technical-coordination interests. In 
        reviewing the request and in light of the Tajikistan Government's endorsement 
        of ITC as the appropriate private-sector manager, and in view of achievement 
        of agreements documenting the framework of accountability described above, 
        the IANA concludes that the .tj ccTLD should be redelegated to ITC.</p>
