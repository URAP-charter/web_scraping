      <p><font color="#0000FF">* In this issue: Organization </font>
      <p>There is much discussion currently about a new organizational framework 
        for the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) due the plan of the 
        US Government to eliminate its funding of the IANA within the next nine 
        months. 
      <p>The US Government has been very generous in funding the IANA service 
        for many years. 
      <p>The observation that the Internet is now dominated by commercial activity 
        suggests that it is now more appropriate for the IANA service to be funded 
        by the direct users of the service and by the Internet industry rather 
        than by the government. 
      <p>This has led to a plan to recast the IANA service as an independent non-profit 
        organization funded by bottom up fees paid by the users of the IANA service 
        and by contributions from the industry. 
      <p>As part of this plan it is important that there be some sub elements 
        of the organization focused on specific aspects of the activity.&nbsp; 
        One particular missing element is a or more likely several groups to represent 
        the interests of the country code domain managers. 
      <p>It is urgent that we follow up on the suggestion that i made in the &quot;News 
        ... #1&quot; in October: 
      <p>&gt; For example, it might be helpful to have a time during the annual 
        INET<BR>
        &gt; conference for those of us that can attend to get together.&nbsp; 
        However,<BR>
        &gt; meeting on a world wide basis may be too expensive, so regional <BR>
        &gt; groupings and meetings are also possible, and i encourage you to 
        form <BR>
        &gt; regional groups, with mailing lists and meetings. 
      <p>I think it would be good to have several regional (with 5 to 7 regions 
        covering the world) groups organized to represent the interests of the 
        contry code domain administrators. 
      <p>An organization of this kind is already being formed in Europe. 
      <P>I think it would be best if these groups were self orgainized, and set 
        up their own mailing lists and meeting arrangements.&nbsp; However, if 
        it is useful for us at the IANA to initially set up some mailing lists 
        we will be happy to do that.</P>
      <P>Information about the country codes contacts may be found through the 
        web pages at:</P>
