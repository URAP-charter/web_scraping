        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Internet Assigned Numbers 
          Authority (the IANA) is responsible for various administrative functions 
          associated with management of the Internet's domain-name system root 
          zone, including reviewing the appropriateness of changes to the content 
          of the root zone as the Internet evolves and preparing reports on requested 
          changes. This report gives the findings and conclusions of the IANA 
          in connection with the deletion of the top-level domain .zr, which was 
          the two-letter code associated with the country formerly known as Zaire.</font></P>

          and Procedural Background</B></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All two-letter top-level 
          domains in the Internet's domain-name system are "country-code top-level 
          domains." The names of these domains are taken from the two-letter code 
          elements ("alpha-2 codes") shown on the <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">ISO 
          3166-1 list</A> maintained by the <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html">ISO 
          3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA)</A>. The <A HREF="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">ISO 
          3166-1 list</A> is used worldwide in many applications involving coded 
          information concerning names of countries and of physically separated 
          dependent territories.</font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Until 1997, the ISO 3166-1 
          list included the alpha-2 code "zr" as the designation of the country 
          of Zaire. In that year, after the name of Zaire was changed to the "Democratic 
          Republic of the Congo," the ISO 3166/MA revised the alpha-2 designation 
          for the country on the ISO 3166-1 list from "zr" to "cd". The alpha-2 
          code "zr" was transferred from the ISO 3166-1 list to the ISO 3166/MA's 
          transitionally reserved list. The reserved code list specifies that 
          "[transitionally reserved] code elements may be used only during a transition 
          period while new code elements that may have replaced them are taken 
          into use."</font></P>
        <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The IANA delegated the .cd 
          top-level domain to the manager of the .zr top-level domain on 20 August 
          1997. Given that "zr" was being removed from the ISO 3166-1 list, the 
          manager performed a transition, populating the .cd top-level domain 
          and emptying the .zr top-level domain. By an 11 March 2001 message to 
          the IANA, the .zr manager stated that the .zr top-level domain had been 
          emptied in preparation for its deletion from the root zone.</font>

        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The IANA is responsible for 
          various functions associated with management of the root zone of the 
          Internet domain-name system. Consistent with those responsibilities, 
          the IANA publishes reports such as this one to document its evaluation 
          of significant issues pertinent to root-zone management.</font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The policies followed in 
          connection with the delegation of Internet top-level domains are summarized 
          in <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">"Internet Domain Name 
          System Structure and Delegation" (ICP-1)</a>, which was issued in May 
          1999.</font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because the IANA is not in 
          the business of assessing whether or not particular areas are "countries," 
          the policy set forth in ICP-1 for delegation matters has been to simply 
          refer to the ISO 3166-1 list as an independent and authoritative source 
          of two-letter abbreviations for countries and areas. (There are a small 
          number of two-letter codes not on the ISO 3166-1 list that are delegated 
          as country-code top-level domains for historic reasons, as described 
          in detail in the IANA's 22 March 2000 <a href="/reports/ps-report-22mar00.htm">"Report 
          on Request for Delegation of .ps Top-Level Domain."</a>) </font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When an alpha-2 code for 
          a country is changed on the ISO 3166-1 list, the IANA's historical practice 
          has been to set up a top-level domain with the new code and to delegate 
          it to the same manager as the existing top-level domain, with the expectation 
          that a transition will occur and that the deprecated top-level domain 
          will be deleted once the migration is completed.</font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The migration of .zr has 
          been completed, with all sub-domains within .zr having been removed. 
          Accordingly, deletion of the .zr top-level domain is now appropriate.</font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A NAME="Conclusion"></A><B>Conclusion</B></font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The IANA concludes that the 
          .zr top-level domain should be deleted from the root zone.</font></P>
