      <P>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA) is responsible for 
        various administrative functions associated with management of the Internet's 
        domain-name system root zone, including reviewing the appropriateness 
        of various contemplated changes to the content of the root zone and preparing 
        reports on those changes. This report gives the findings and conclusions 
        of the IANA on the establishment of the .aero top-level domain (TLD).</P>
      <P><a name="Factualand ProceduralBackground"></a><b>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></P>
      <p>The Internet domain-name system (DNS) was deployed under the guidance 
        of <a href="http://www.postel.org/jonpostel.html">Jon Postel</a> in 1984 
        and 1985 (see <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc921.txt">RFC 921</a>) 
        as a distributed database for information about resources on the Internet, 
        replacing the prior &quot;hosts.txt&quot; system. The DNS contains resource 
        records that map easy-to-remember domain names to the unique numeric addresses 
        assigned to every computer on the Internet.</p>
      <p>The DNS is organized hierarchically with several top-level domains (TLDs) 
        containing second-level domains (SLDs), which in turn contain third-level 
        domains (3LDs), etc. A domain name consists of a series of labels, separated 
        by dots, tracing the hierarchy from the top-level domain down to the specific 
        computer being identified: &lt;3LD&gt;.&lt;SLD&gt;.&lt;TLD&gt;. Thus, 
        the domain name &quot;www.icann.org&quot; is within the &quot;www&quot; 
        third-level domain of the &quot;icann&quot; second-level domain of the 
        &quot;org&quot; top-level domain.</p>
      <p>To take advantage of the DNS's hierarchical nature, it was initially 
        contemplated that there would be a limited number of top-level domains. 
        In <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc920.txt">RFC 920</a>, entitled 
        &quot;Domain Requirements&quot; (Oct. 1984), Dr. Postel and Joyce Reynolds 
        proposed top-level domains with the names &quot;arpa&quot; (intended to 
        be transitional for the &quot;ARPA-Internet&quot;), &quot;com&quot; (commercial), 
        &quot;edu&quot; (education), &quot;gov&quot; (government), &quot;mil&quot; 
        (military), and &quot;org&quot; (organization) as well as two-letter (alpha-2) 
        names identifying countries according to the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html">ISO 
        3166-1 list</a>.&quot;<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> By the time of actual 
        implementation of the top-level domains in January 1985, an additional 
        top-level domain named &quot;net&quot; was included. In November 1988, 
        an additional top-level domain named &quot;int&quot; was added for international 
        organizations established by intergovernmental agreements.</p>
      <p>In March 1994, Dr. Postel published <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</a>, entitled &quot;Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; 
        (J. Postel March 1994), which described the overall structure of the DNS 
        at the time. He described the top-level domains as follows:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>There are a set of what are called &quot;top-level domain names&quot; 
          (TLDs). These are the generic TLDs (EDU, COM, NET, ORG, GOV, MIL, and 
          INT), and the two letter country codes from ISO-3166. It is extremely 
          unlikely that any other TLDs will be created.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Beginning in 1995-1996, some members of the Internet community expressed 
        concern over lack of choice concerning registration services in the generic 
        top-level domains (gTLDs). By January 1998, the U.S. Department of Commerce, 
        in issuing its Green Paper<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> as a discussion 
        draft concerning possible improvements in the technical management of 
        the DNS, listed &quot;widespread dissatisfaction about the absence of 
        competition in domain name registration&quot; as a principal motivation 
        for its conclusion that improvements in the Internet's technical management 
        were necessary. The Green Paper discussed the introduction of additional 
        TLDs in this context.</p>
      <p>In June 1998, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its White Paper,<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> 
        calling on the Internet community to form a new, not-for-profit organization 
        to assume responsibility for the necessarily centralized technical coordination 
        functions then performed by the IANA. In response, the Internet community 
        formed the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 
        in late 1998.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p>
      <p>The White Paper specified that one of ICANN's principal responsibilities 
        would be to &quot;oversee policy for determining the circumstances under 
        which new TLDs are added to the root system,&quot; including &quot;development 
        of policies for the addition, allocation, and management of gTLDs and 
        the establishment of domain name registries and domain name registrars 
        to host gTLDs . . . .&quot; As the White Paper recognized, &quot;The challenge 
        of deciding policy for the addition of new domains will be formidable.&quot; 
        To address this challenge, in the White Paper the U.S. Government observed, 
        &quot;At least in the short run, a prudent concern for the stability of 
        the system suggests that expansion of gTLDs proceed at a deliberate and 
        controlled pace to allow for evaluation of the impact of the new gTLDs 
        and well-reasoned evolution of the domain space.&quot;</p>
      <p>For nearly the entire time since it was formed, ICANN has devoted a significant 
        part of its activities to the consideration of the establishment of new 
        generic TLDs. At the ICANN meeting in Berlin in May 1999, ICANN's Board 
        referred the issue of new TLDs to the (then newly formed) Domain Name 
        Supporting Organization (DNSO).<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> In response 
        to this referral, in June 1999 the DNSO Names Council (which manages the 
        process for development of policy recommendations within the DNSO) <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/19990625.NCsj-admin.html">created</a> 
        a group, known as Working Group C, to study the issues raised by the introduction 
        of new TLDs.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> After nine months of extensive 
        discussions<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> and review of several position 
        papers,<sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Working Group C submitted its <a href="http://www.icann.org/dnso/wgc-report-21mar00.htm">report 
        to the DNSO Names Council on 21 March 2000</a>,<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> 
        recommending introduction of a limited number of TLDs, and posted the 
        report for public comment. Public comments were <a href="http://www.icann.org/dnso/new-gtlds-01apr00.htm">solicited</a> 
        and received through the <a href="http://forum.icann.org/wgc/">ICANN's 
        web-based comment forum</a> and <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/dnsocomments/comments-gtlds/Arc01/maillist.html">via 
        e-mail to the dnso.org site</a>.</p>
      <p>The Names Council discussed the report and comments at a <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/20000418.NCtelecon-minutes.html">telephone 
        conference held on 18/19 April 2000</a>. At that meeting, the Names Council 
        adopted the following statement, by a vote of 16-0 (two members were absent):</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The Names Council therefore recommends to the ICANN Board that it establish 
          a policy for the introduction of new gTLDs in a measured and responsible 
          manner, giving due regard in the implementation of that policy to (a) 
          promoting orderly registration of names during the initial phases; (b) 
          minimizing the use of gTLDs to carry out infringements of intellectual 
          property rights; and (c) recognizing the need for ensuring user confidence 
          in the technical operation of the new TLD and the DNS as a whole.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The DNSO recommendation continued:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>we recommend to the Board that a limited number of new top-level domains 
          be introduced initially and that the future introduction of additional 
          top-level domains be done only after careful evaluation of the initial 
          introduction.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>On 16 July 2000, after considering <a href="http://forum.icann.org/newtlds/">well 
        over 1000 public comments</a>, the ICANN Board <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-16jul00.htm#00.46">adopted 
        the DNSO recommendations</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-16jul00.htm#00.47">authorized 
        the ICANN President to formally call for proposals</a> to operate or sponsor 
        new TLDs.</p>
      <p>On 15 August 2000, ICANN <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-application-process.htm">posted 
        a public call for applications</a> on its web site<sup><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/announcements/icann-pr16aug00.htm">broadly 
        announced the availability of the application materials</a>. At the same 
        time, ICANN published <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-criteria-15aug00.htm">detailed 
        criteria</a> for the consideration of any applications received. In response 
        to the call, <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-applications-lodged-02oct00.htm">forty-four 
        completed applications</a> were received.</p>
      <p>Once these applications were submitted, they were posted on ICANN's web 
        site for public comment. Over 4000 comments were received; <a href="http://forum.icann.org/tldapps/">all 
        appeared on ICANN's web site</a>. ICANN also assembled a team of technical, 
        financial, and legal experts<sup><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> to review 
        and evaluate the applications, which issued a <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/report/">326-page 
        evaluation report</a> on the applications. Additional public comments 
        were received on this report, both on a <a href="http://forum.icann.org/tldreport/">web-based 
        forum established by ICANN for this purpose</a> (over 1000 comments received) 
        and at an <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/icann/la2000/archive/">all-day 
        public forum</a> held in Marina del Rey, California, USA on 15 November 
        2000.</p>
      <p>The introduction of new TLDs was the principal issue addressed at <a href="http://www.icann.org/mdr2000/">ICANN's 
        annual meeting in November 2000</a>. Leading up to that meeting, the Internet 
        community had spent several weeks reviewing the applications and the detailed 
        evaluation report, engaged in a robust dialogue on ICANN's web-based public 
        forums (with a total of over 5000 postings), and intensely discussed the 
        issues through ICANN's constituency and supporting organization structures. 
        After extensive study of the materials in advance of the meeting and participation 
        in the all-day public forum, the ICANN Board discussed the applications 
        in a <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/icann/la2000/archive/agenda-bm-111600.html">several-hour 
        open session on 16 November 2000</a>. As a result of this review, seven 
        proposals to operate or sponsor TLDs <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-16nov00.htm#00.89">were 
        selected</a> for an initial introduction of TLDs, as recommended by the 
        DNSO.</p>
      <p>In late 2000, ICANN and the proponents of the selected proposals began 
        negotiations for appropriate agreements under which those TLDs could be 
        introduced while preserving the stability of the DNS. These discussions 
        led to the development of two model agreements: one for &quot;sponsored&quot; 
        TLDs and another for &quot;unsponsored&quot; TLDs. Generally speaking, 
        an unsponsored TLD operates under policies established by the global Internet 
        community directly through the ICANN process, while a sponsored TLD is 
        a specialized TLD that has a sponsor representing the narrower community 
        that is most affected by the TLD. The sponsor thus carries out delegated 
        policy-formulation responsibilities over many matters concerning the TLD.</p>
      <p>In April and July 2001, negotiations of the unsponsored agreements for 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/biz/">.biz</a>, <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/info/">.info</a>, 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/name/">.name</a> were 
        completed and the agreements were subsequently signed. The IANA issued 
        reports on <a href="/reports/biz-info-report-25jun01.htm">.biz and .info</a> 
        (25 June 2001) and <a href="/reports/name-report-16aug01.htm">.name</a> 
        (16 August 2001). These three unsponsored TLDs have been added to the 
        root zone.</p>
      <p>In August and early November 2001, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/museum/">.museum</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/coop/">.coop</a> negotiations 
        were completed; these agreements were signed (after review periods) on 
        17 October and 21 November 2001. On 30 October and 13 December 2001 the 
        IANA issued reports concluding that <a href="/reports/museum-report-30oct01.htm">.museum</a> 
        and <a href="/reports/coop-report-13dec01.htm">.coop</a> should be added 
        to the root zone.</p>
      <p>Negotiation of the third sponsored TLD agreement&#151;for .aero&#151;was 
        completed and the agreement and all of its attachments was posted on 20 
        November 2001. After a review period, which precipitated a request for 
        reconsideration, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/aero/">.aero 
        agreement was signed on 17 December 2001</a>.</p>
      <p>The .aero agreement, like the .museum and .coop agreements, establishes 
        technical operational requirements, but delegates to the sponsor of .aero, 
        Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Internationale de T&eacute;l&eacute;communications 
        A&eacute;ronautiques SC (SITA), authority to create policies governing 
        such topics as eligibility for registration within the .aero TLD. It also 
        requires the sponsor to conduct its policy-development activities in manner 
        that allows members of the .aero community to discuss and participate 
        in the development of these policies. Thus, the sponsored TLD model ensures 
        stable technical operation, by requiring adherence to the standard specifications 
        on such topics as nameservice, data escrow, and use of valid host names, 
        while providing a substantial degree of autonomy for development of community-specific 
        policies.</p>
      <p><a name="Evaluation"></a><b>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">21 
        March 2001 contact for performance of the IANA function</a> between the 
        United States Government and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names 
        and Numbers. Under that contract, the IANA is responsible for various 
        functions, known as the &quot;IANA functions&quot;, associated with the 
        management of the root zone of the Internet domain-name system.</p>
      <p>As contemplated by the White Paper, the Internet community has pursued 
        an extensive consensus-development process through ICANN and its Domain 
        Name Supporting Organization. This process, which has included participation 
        by hundreds of individuals and organizations in the Internet community, 
        has reached the consensus position, as <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/20000418.NCtelecon-minutes.html">recommended 
        by the DNSO Names Council without dissent</a>, that &quot;a limited number 
        of new top-level domains [should] be introduced initially and that the 
        future introduction of additional top-level domains [should] be done only 
        after careful evaluation of the initial introduction.&quot; Following 
        this policy and through additional community-based processes, ICANN has 
        selected seven proposals for the initial introduction, with the goal of 
        launching these TLDs cautiously, then observing and evaluating the results. 
      </p>
      <p>If the initial introduction is successful, this experience should lay 
        the groundwork for future introductions as part of what the White Paper 
        termed a &quot;well-reasoned evolution of the domain space.&quot; On 13 
        August 2001, ICANN announced the formation of a &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/ntepptf/">New 
        TLD Evaluation Process Planning Task Force</a>&quot; charged with developing 
        a plan for monitoring the introduction of new TLDs and for evaluating 
        their performance impact on the performance of the DNS. That task force 
        issued an interim report, on which public comment has been sought, on 
        3 December 2001.</p>
      <p>ICANN has now completed contractual arrangements for the introduction 
        of the sixth of the selected TLDs, with SITA for .aero.</p>
      <p>The first goal of the community-based management of the DNS is to preserve 
        the DNS's stable and reliable operation. One key prerequisite for ensuring 
        stability is the formation of agreements creating a framework of accountability 
        among those entities (ICANN, TLD sponsors, and registry operators) responsible 
        for that operation. Like the previous registry agreements for .biz, .info, 
        and .name and the previous TLD Sponsorship Agreements for .coop and .museum, 
        the TLD Sponsorship Agreement for .aero has been designed to establish 
        the necessary accountability framework, ensuring that .aero is introduced 
        in a sound manner that will maintain stable and reliable technical operation 
        of the DNS. In particular, the contract recites functional and performance 
        specifications, data escrow requirements, and a detailed start-up plan 
        that is designed to ensure that stable operation of the DNS is maintained, 
        both during the startup phase and in the long term. User awareness is 
        also relevant to smooth operation of the DNS; experience has shown that 
        some level of confusion accompanies almost any change in the DNS. The 
        operator of .aero however, has committed to information-dissemination 
        measures that should keep any public confusion to a minimum.</p>
      <p>Registration activities for .aero are scheduled to be phased in beginning 
        in early 2002. To assist in a stable introduction with the public awareness 
        needed to minimize confusion, the .aero top-level domain should be established 
        in the DNS at this time for testing and evaluation purposes. Initially, 
        the nameservice for the domains will be operated by the IANA, which will 
        conduct various testing procedures and then, according to schedules and 
        procedures developed jointly with SITA, transition the nameservice to 
        servers operated by those companies in time for the onset of regular resolution 
        of names within .aero.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The IANA concludes that the .aero TLD should be established by adding 
        it to the root zone at this time for testing and evaluation.<br>

      <p><a name="fn1"></a>1. <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc920.txt">RFC 
        920</a> also indicated that top-level domains might be added in the future 
        for &quot;multiorganizations&quot;. This was never pursued, except to 
        the extent of the .int top-level domain introduced in 1988.</p>
      <p><a name="fn2"></a>2. Although the .arpa domain was intended to be used 
        only in the transition to the DNS, it was not discontinued as originally 
        planned because it contained the reverse-lookup domain for IP addresses 
        (in-addr.arpa). See <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1101.txt">RFC 
        1101</a>, &quot;DNS Encoding of Network Names and Other Types&quot; (P. 
        Mockapetris Apr. 1989), for background. The continuing importance of the 
        reverse-lookup facility and the practical difficulties in moving it to 
        another domain, made it infeasible to eliminate the .arpa top-level altogether. 
        In May 2000, the Internet Architecture Board published its &quot;<a href="http://www.iab.org/iab/DOCUMENTS/statement-on-infrastructure-domains.txt">Statement 
        on Infrastructure Domain and Subdomains</a>&quot;, which recommends permanent 
        retention of the .arpa TLD for Internet-infrastructure purposes. The &quot;arpa&quot; 
        abbreviation was redesignated to &quot;Address and Routing Parameter Area&quot;

      <p><a name="fn5"></a>5. In response to the White Paper, Internet stakeholders 
        from around the world came together in an extensive process of discussions 
        and negotiations. The process included meetings, conferences, and most 
        appropriately for the purpose, extensive use of the Internet. By the beginning 
        of October 1998, this process had reached a successful conclusion and 
        on behalf of the global Internet community Dr. Postel <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/icann/icann.html">submitted 
        to the U.S. Commerce Department</a> articles of incorporation and proposed 
        bylaws for ICANN to &quot;reflect the consensus judgment of the global 
        Internet community as to how to form a corporation that will include the 
        IANA function, and in addition take on other coordination and administrative 
        responsibilities necessary for the continued operational stability and 
        growth of the Internet. &quot; See <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/icann/letter.htm">Letter

        June 1999 meeting in San Jose, California, USA</a>, the Names Council

        introduced generic TLDs.</p>
      <p><a name="fn8"></a>8. These discussions are archived in two parts: <a href="http://www.dnso.org/wgroups/wg-c/Arc00/maillist.html">up
