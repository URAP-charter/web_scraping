        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Internet domain-name 
          syste</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">m (DNS) was deployed 
          under the guidance of <a href="http://www.postel.org/jonpostel.html">Jon 
          Postel</a> in 1984 and 1985 (see <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc921.txt">RFC 
          921</a>) as a distributed database for information about resources on 
          the Internet, replacing the prior &quot;hosts.txt&quot; system. The 
          DNS contains resource records that map easy-to-remember domain names 
          to the unique numeric addresses assigned to every computer on the Internet.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The DNS is organized hierarchically 
          with several top-level domains (TLDs) containing second-level domains 
          (SLDs), which in turn contain third-level domains (3LDs), etc. A domain 
          name consists of a series of labels, separated by dots, tracing the 
          hierarchy from the top-level domain down to the specific computer being 
          identified: &lt;3LD&gt;.&lt;SLD&gt;.&lt;TLD&gt;. Thus, the domain name 
          &quot;www.icann.org&quot; is within the &quot;www&quot; third-level 
          domain of the &quot;icann&quot; second-level domain of the &quot;org&quot; 
          top-level domain.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To take advantage of the 
          DNS's hierarchical nature, it was initially contemplated that there 
          would be a limited number of top-level domains. In <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc920.txt">RFC 
          920</a>, entitled &quot;Domain Requirements&quot; (Oct. 1984), Dr. Postel 
          and Joyce Reynolds proposed top-level domains with the names &quot;arpa&quot; 
          (intended to be transitional for the &quot;ARPA-Internet&quot;), &quot;com&quot; 
          (commercial), &quot;edu&quot; (education), &quot;gov&quot; (government), 
          &quot;mil&quot; (military), and &quot;org&quot; (organization) as well 
          as two-letter (alpha-2) names identifying countries according to the 
          <a href="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">ISO 
          3166-1 list</a>.&quot;<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> By the time of 
          actual implementation of the top-level domains in January 1985, an additional 
          top-level domain named &quot;net&quot; was included. In November 1988, 
          an additional top-level domain named &quot;int&quot; was added for international 
          organizations established by intergovernmental agreements. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In March 1994, Dr. Postel 
          published <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt">RFC 1591</a>, 
          entitled &quot;Domain Name System Structure and Delegation&quot; (J. 
          Postel March 1994), which described the overall structure of the DNS 
          at the time. He described the top-level domains as follows:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There are a set of what 
            are called &quot;top-level domain names&quot; (TLDs). These are the 
            generic TLDs (EDU, COM, NET, ORG, GOV, MIL, and INT), and the two 
            letter country codes from ISO-3166. It is extremely unlikely that 
            any other TLDs will be created.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beginning in 1995-1996, some 
          members of the Internet community expressed concern over lack of choice 
          concerning registration services in the generic top-level domains (gTLDs). 
          By January 1998, the U.S. Department of Commerce, in issuing its Green 
          Paper<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> as a discussion draft concerning 
          possible improvements in the technical management of the DNS, listed 
          &quot;widespread dissatisfaction about the absence of competition in 
          domain name registration&quot; as a principal motivation for its conclusion 
          that improvements in the Internet's technical management were necessary. 
          The Green Paper discussed the introduction of additional TLDs in this 
          context.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In June 1998, the U.S. Department 
          of Commerce issued its White Paper,<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> calling 
          on the Internet community to form a new, not-for-profit organization 
          to assume responsibility for the necessarily centralized technical coordination 
          functions then performed by the IANA. In response, the Internet community 
          formed the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 
          in late 1998.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The White Paper specified 
          that one of ICANN's principal responsibilities would be to &quot;oversee 
          policy for determining the circumstances under which new TLDs are added 
          to the root system,&quot; including &quot;development of policies for 
          the addition, allocation, and management of gTLDs and the establishment 
          of domain name registries and domain name registrars to host gTLDs . 
          . . .&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the 
          White Paper recognized, &quot;The challenge of deciding policy for the 
          addition of new domains will be formidable.&quot; To address this challenge, 
          in the White Paper the U.S. Government observed, &quot;At least in the 
          short run, a prudent concern for the stability of the system suggests 
          that expansion of gTLDs proceed at a deliberate and controlled pace 
          to allow for evaluation of the impact of the new gTLDs and well-reasoned 
          evolution of the domain space.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For nearly the entire time 
          since it was formed, ICANN has devoted a significant part of its activities 
          to the consideration of the establishment of new generic TLDs. At the 
          ICANN meeting in Berlin in May 1999, ICANN's Board referred the issue 
          of new TLDs to the (then newly formed) Domain Name Supporting Organization 
          (DNSO).<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> In response to this referral, 
          in June 1999 the DNSO Names Council (which manages the process for development 
          of policy recommendations within the DNSO) <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/19990625.NCsj-admin.html">created</a> 
          a group, known as Working Group C, to study the issues raised by the 
          introduction of new TLDs.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> After nine 
          months of extensive discussions<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> and review 
          of several position papers,<sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Working Group 
          C submitted its <a href="http://www.icann.org/dnso/wgc-report-21mar00.htm">report 
          to the DNSO Names Council on 21 March 2000</a>,<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> 
          recommending introduction of a limited number of TLDs, and posted the 
          report for public comment. Public comments were <a href="http://www.icann.org/dnso/new-gtlds-01apr00.htm">solicited</a> 
          and received through the <a href="http://forum.icann.org/wgc/">ICANN's

          e-mail to the dnso.org site</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Names Council discussed 
          the report and comments at a <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/20000418.NCtelecon-minutes.html">telephone 
          conference held on 18/19 April 2000</a>. At that meeting, the Names 
          Council adopted the following statement, by a vote of 16-0 (two members 
          were absent):</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Names Council therefore 
            recommends to the ICANN Board that it establish a policy for the introduction 
            of new gTLDs in a measured and responsible manner, giving due regard 
            in the implementation of that policy to (a) promoting orderly registration 
            of names during the initial phases; (b) minimizing the use of gTLDs 
            to carry out infringements of intellectual property rights; and (c) 
            recognizing the need for ensuring user confidence in the technical 
            operation of the new TLD and the DNS as a whole.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The DNSO recommendation continued:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> we recommend to the Board 
            that a limited number of new top-level domains be introduced initially 
            and that the future introduction of additional top-level domains be 
            done only after careful evaluation of the initial introduction.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 16 July 2000, after considering 
          <a href="http://forum.icann.org/newtlds/">well over 1000 public comments</a>, 
          the ICANN Board <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/minutes-16jul00.htm#00.46">adopted

          a public call for applications</a> on its web site<sup><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> 
          and <a href="http://www.icann.org/announcements/icann-pr16aug00.htm">broadly 
          announced the availability of the application materials</a>. At the 
          same time, ICANN published <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-criteria-15aug00.htm">detailed 
          criteria</a> for the consideration any applications received. In response

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once these applications were 
          submitted, they were posted on ICANN's web site for public comment. 
          Over 4000 comments were received; <a href="http://forum.icann.org/tldapps/">all 
          appeared on ICANN's web site</a>. ICANN also assembled a team of technical, 
          financial, and legal experts<sup><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> to review 
          and evaluate the applications, which issued a <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/report/">326-page 
          evaluation report</a> on the applications. Additional public comments 
          were received on this report, both on a <a href="http://forum.icann.org/tldreport/">web-based 
          forum established by ICANN for this purpose</a> (over 1000 comments 
          received) and at an <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/icann/la2000/archive/">all-day 
          public forum</a> held in Marina del Rey, California, USA on 15 November 
          2000.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The introduction of new TLDs 
          was the principal issue addressed at <a href="http://www.icann.org/mdr2000/">ICANN's 
          annual meeting in November 2000</a>. Leading up to that meeting, the 
          Internet community had spent several weeks reviewing the applications 
          and the detailed evaluation report, engaged in a robust dialogue on 
          ICANN's web-based public forums (with a total of over 5000 postings), 
          and intensely discussed the issues through ICANN's constituency and 
          supporting organization structures. After extensive study of the materials 
          in advance of the meeting and participation in the all-day public forum, 
          the ICANN Board discussed the applications in a <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/icann/la2000/archive/agenda-bm-111600.html">several-hour 
          open session on 16 November 2000</a>. As a result of this review, seven 
          proposals to operate or sponsor TLDs <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-16nov00.htm#00.89">were 
          selected</a> for an initial introduction of TLDs, as recommended by 
          the DNSO.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In late 2000, ICANN and the 
          proponents of the selected proposals began negotiations for appropriate 
          agreements under which those TLDs could be introduced while preserving 
          the stability of the DNS. In early July 2001, the third agreement, concerning 
          .name top-level domain, was completed. The agreement establishes technical 
          requirements, similar to those covering the .com, .net, and .org TLDs, 
          for the operation of the new TLDs (covering such topics as nameservice, 
          data escrow, use of valid host names, and system security and redundancy) 
          and provides for observance of various policies developed through the 
          ICANN process.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The draft agreement for .name 
          was <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/unsponsored/registry-agmt-02jul01.htm">posted 
          on ICANN's web site</a> on 3 July 2001. Following <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/background-31jul01.htm">review 
          and comment by both the ICANN Board and the community</a>, the agreement 
          was <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-31jul01.htm#nameRegistryAgreement">formally 
          approved by the ICANN Board</a> on 31 July 2001, and signed on 1 August

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This report is being provided 
          under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">21 
          March 2001 contact for performance of the IANA function</a> between 
          the United States Government and the Internet Corporation for Assigned 
          Names and Numbers. Under that contract, the IANA is responsible for 
          various functions, known as the &quot;IANA functions&quot;, associated 
          with the management of the root zone of the Internet domain-name system.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As contemplated by the White 
          Paper, the Internet community has pursued an extensive consensus-development 
          process through ICANN and its Domain Name Supporting Organization. This 
          process, which has included extensive participation by hundreds of individuals 
          and organizations in the Internet community, has reached the consensus 
          position, as <a href="http://www.dnso.org/dnso/notes/20000418.NCtelecon-minutes.html">recommended 
          by the DNSO Names Council without dissent</a>, that &quot;a limited 
          number of new top-level domains [should] be introduced initially and 
          that the future introduction of additional top-level domains [should] 
          be done only after careful evaluation of the initial introduction.&quot; 
          Following this policy and through additional community-based processes, 
          ICANN has selected seven proposals for the initial introduction, with 
          the goal of launching these TLDs cautiously, then observing and evaluating 
          the results. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the initial introduction 
          is successful, this experience should lay the groundwork for future 
          introductions as part of what the White Paper termed a &quot;well-reasoned 
          evolution of the domain space.&quot; On 13 August 2001, ICANN announced 
          the formation of a &quot;New TLD Evaluation Process Planning Task Force&quot; 
          charged with developing a plan for monitoring the introduction of new 
          TLDs and for evaluating their performance impact on the performance 
          of the DNS. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ICANN has now completed contractual 
          arrangements for the introduction of the third<sup><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup> 
          of the selected TLDs, with Global Name Registry for .name.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first goal of the community-based 
          management of the DNS is to preserve the DNS's stable and reliable operation. 
          Like the previous registry agreements with .biz and .info, the registry 
          agreement that has been completed with the TLD operator has been designed 
          to ensure that this TLD is introduced in a sound manner that will maintain 
          stable and reliable technical operation of the DNS. In particular, the 
          contract recites functional and performance specifications, data escrow 
          requirements, and a detailed start-up plan that is designed to ensure 
          that stable operation of the DNS is maintained, both during the startup 
          phase and in the long term. User awareness is also relevant to smooth 
          operation of the DNS; experience has shown that some level of confusion 
          accompanies almost any change in the DNS. The operator of .name however,

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Registration activities for 
          .name will occur beginning in mid-August 2001, with DNS resolution of 
          the names that are registered to begin in November 2001. To assist in 
          a stable introduction with the public awareness needed to minimize confusion, 
          ICANN has agreed with Global Name Registry that the .name TLD should 
          be established in the DNS at this time for testing and evaluation purposes. 
          <a href="#fn14">14</a> Initially, the nameservice for the domains will 
          be operated by the IANA, which will conduct various testing procedures 
          and then, according to schedules and procedures developed jointly with 
          Global Name Registry, transition the nameservice to servers operated 
          by the company in time for the November 2001 onset of regular resolution 
          of .name domain names.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The IANA concludes that the 
          .name TLD should be established by adding it to the root zone at this 
          time for testing and evaluation. To ensure a smooth and stable introduction, 
          the nameservice should be operated initially by the IANA and then transitioned 
          to the selected operator, Global Name Registry, after the .name zone 
          is ready for population with the initial registrations and their nameserver 
          constellations are demonstrated to be stable and robust.<br>

          Although the .arpa domain was intended to be used only in the transition 
          to the DNS, it was not discontinued as originally planned because it 
          contained the reverse-lookup domain for IP addresses (in-addr.arpa). 
          See <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1101.txt">RFC 1101</a>, 
          &quot;DNS Encoding of Network Names and Other Types&quot; (P. Mockapetris 
          Apr. 1989), for background. The continuing importance of the reverse-lookup 
          facility and the practical difficulties in moving it to another domain, 
          made it infeasible to eliminate the .arpa top-level altogether. In May 
          2000, the Internet Architecture Board published its &quot;<a href="http://www.iab.org/iab/DOCUMENTS/statement-on-infrastructure-domains.txt">Statement 
          on Infrastructure Domain and Subdomains</a>&quot;, which recommends 
          permanent retention of the .arpa TLD for Internet-infrastructure purposes. 
          The &quot;arpa&quot; abbreviation was redesignated to &quot;Address 
          and Routing Parameter Area&quot; to reduce confusion with the earlier 
          network name. </font></p>

          In response to the White Paper, Internet stakeholders from around the 
          world came together in an extensive process of discussions and negotiations. 
          The process included meetings, conferences, and most appropriately for 
          the purpose, extensive use of the Internet. By the beginning of October 
          1998, this process had reached a successful conclusion and on behalf 
          of the global Internet community Dr. Postel <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/icann/icann.html">submitted 
          to the U.S. Commerce Department</a> articles of incorporation and proposed 
          bylaws for ICANN to &quot;reflect the consensus judgment of the global 
          Internet community as to how to form a corporation that will include 
          the IANA function, and in addition take on other coordination and administrative 
          responsibilities necessary for the continued operational stability and 
          growth of the Internet. &quot; See <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/proposals/icann/letter.htm">Letter

          A similar procedure was followed with .biz and .info. In addition to 
          revealing an issue concerning inappropriate DNS dynamic update attempts 
          due to misconfigured client computers throughout the Internet, this 
          procedure has allowed the Registry Operators for those TLDs to establish 
          their network information center websites at an early stage, before 
          they were ready for full launch of their nameserver constellations. 
          These websites have assisted in efforts to educate the public about 
          the new TLDs and also permit testing of interactive websites to determine 
          whether they properly interact with computers in the domains of the 
          new TLDs.</font></p>
