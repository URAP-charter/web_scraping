      <p align="left">The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part 
        of the administrative functions associated with management of the domain-name 
        system root, is responsible for receiving requests for delegation and 
        redelegation of top-level domains, investigating the circumstances pertinent 
        to those requests, and reporting on the requests. In May 2001, the IANA 
        received a request for redelegation of the .au (Australia) top-level domain. 
        This report gives the findings and conclusions of the IANA on its investigation 
        of that request. </p>
      <p><b><a name="FactualandProceduralBackground"></a>Factual and Procedural 
        Background</b></p>
      <p>In March 1986, the University of Southern California's <a href="http://www.isi.edu/">Information 
        Sciences Institute</a> (which then performed the IANA functions) approved 
        a request for establishment of the .au ccTLD. At that time and today, 
        that two-letter code was and is set forth on the <a href="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/codlstp1/en_listp1.html">ISO 
        3166-1 list</a> maintained by the <a href="http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html">ISO 
        3166 Maintenance Agency</a> (ISO 3166/MA) as the approved alpha-2 code 
        for Australia.</p>
      <p>Australia, with a <a href="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/as.html">population 
        of nearly 20,000,000,</a> is a member of the <a href="http://www.thecommonwealth.org/">British 
        Commonwealth</a>. Australia is the world's smallest continent and is located 
        south of Asia and between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The country consists 
        of six states, two territories on the Australian continent, and several 
        smaller islands.</p>
      <p>Australia was an early participant in the Internet, <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/II/OzIHist.html">beginning 
        with the Australian Computer Science Network (ACSnet) in the mid-1970s</a>. 
        As noted above, the .au ccTLD was established in March 1986, shortly after 
        the Internet domain-name system was deployed in 1985. With the benefit 
        of an excellent communications system with international connectivity 
        provided by submarine cables and Intelsat and Inmarsat service, Australian 
        Internet usage has grown rapidly, with an <a href="http://www.c-i-a.com/199809iu.htm">estimated 
        8,000,000 users at the end of 2000</a>.</p>
      <p>Upon its establishment in 1986, the .au ccTLD was delegated to <a href="http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/authors/ElzRobert.htm">Robert 
        Elz</a>, a network programmer at the <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University 
        of Melbourne</a>. Mr. Elz has been a longstanding leader in the development 
        of the Internet in Australia, having played a key role in the deployment 
        of ACSnet. Taking into account the best interests of the Australian Internet 
        community, Mr. Elz has selflessly served in a volunteer capacity since 
        his appointment as the .au ccTLD's manager.</p>
      <p>Since the delegation of the .au ccTLD to Mr. Elz, the use of the Internet 
        in Australia has undergone tremendous growth. This expansion of Internet 
        use has resulted in strong demand for registrations under the .au ccTLD. 
        To meet this demand for convenient names within the .au ccTLD, <a href="http://www.auda.org.au/docs/technical-report.pdf">eleven 
        second-level domains</a> have been established under .au: asn.au, com.au, 
        conf.au, csiro.au, edu.au, gov.au, id.au, info.au, net.au, org.au, and 
        oz.au. The first eight are basically open to all users, subject to some 
        eligibility criteria, while the last three have defined communities of 
        interest.</p>
      <p>As the .au ccTLD has evolved to accommodate increased Internet usage 
        under Mr. Elz's personal stewardship, the Australian Internet community 
        has recognized that the task of administering the .au ccTLD should move 
        from a single person's responsibilty to a private-sector self-regulatory 
        regime capable of taking on the responsibility for administering the .au 
        ccTLD in a manner that is more formally accountable to the community. 
        In the past several years the Australian Internet community, with the 
        assistance of the Australian Government, has been engaged in efforts to 
        establish such an organization to facilitate continued robust and scalable 
        growth and operation of the Internet naming system in Australia. </p>
      <p>In 1997, Internet stakeholders established the <a href="http://www.auda.org.au/archive/adna/">Australian 
        Domain Name Administration</a> (ADNA), with the primary objective of ensuring 
        the operation of a functional Internet naming system in Australia for 
        the .au domain. The participants in the ADNA initiative, however, ultimately 
        concluded that organization did not have the necessary authority to operate 
        effectively and be accountable to the local Internet community. As a result, 
        the ADNA Board, together with Internet industry stakeholders, requested 
        the assistance of the Australian <a href="http://www.govonline.gov.au/">National 
        Office for the Information Economy</a> (NOIE), an office of the Commonwealth 
        of Australia's Ministry of Communications, Information Technology and 
        the Arts, to facilitate the development of an effective Internet industry 
        self-regulatory regime and to oversee the transfer of delegation for the 
        administration of the .au domain space to the new regime. </p>
      <p>In 1999, the Australian Government, through NOIE, <a href="http://www.noie.gov.au/projects/information_economy/domains_au/index.htm">agreed 
        to assist</a> in faciliating the development of a self-regulatory regime 
        to assume responsibility from Mr. Elz for management of the .au ccTLD. 
        NOIE initiated a consultative process, originally intended to be completed 
        in April 2000, with the Australian industry and the local Internet community 
        in an effort to develop a broadly accepted mechanism for overseeing .au's 
        administration in a way that includes participation by the stakeholders 
        within the Australian Internet community. The consultation addressed key 
        issues and was led by a working group chaired by Greg Crew (who also <a href="http://www.icann.org/biog/crew.htm">served 
        as an initial Director of ICANN</a>) and including representatives of 
        various stakeholders. The working group recommended creation of a new, 
        not-for-profit body to administer the .au domain space. Following that 
        recommendation, the .au Domain Administration (auDA) <a href="http://www.noie.gov.au/projects/information_economy/domains_au/">was 
        formed</a>. On 15 November 1999, <a href="http://www.auda.org.au/docs/letter-com.au.html">Mr. 
        Elz sub-delegated to auDA</a> the authority to manage the .com.au namespace, 
        which comprises approximately 85% of all domain names within the .au ccTLD.</p>
      <p>On 9 October 2000, auDA submitted to NOIE <a href="http://www.auda.org.au/docs/to-govt-2000-10.html">a 
        comprehensive report</a> describing auDA's achievements as of that time 
        and its goals for the next 12-18 months. That report described the steps 
        that auDA had taken to meet the objectives for Governmental endorsement 
        of auDA to become responsible for management of the .au ccTLD:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>operate as a fully self-funding and not-for-profit organization;</li>
        <li>be inclusive of, and accountable to, members of the Internet community 
          including both the supply and demand sides; </li>
        <li>adopt open, transparent and consultative processes; </li>
        <li>aim to enhance benefits to Internet users through the promotion of 
          competition, fair trading and provisions for consumer protection and 
          support; </li>
        <li>establish appropriate dispute resolution mechanisms; and </li>
        <li>represent Australian Internet industry interests in the Internet domain-name 
          system at national and international fora.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The report observed:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>At this point, auDA has made considerable progress towards achieving 
          its aims. However these aims cannot be fully realised until the transfer 
          of authority for .au has been affected. <i>The very fact that auDA does 
          not have formal authority for the .au ccTLD is now starting to limit 
          the organisation's capability to undertake its business.</i> This is 
          clearly demonstrated by a number of the second level domain registrars 
          that have not yet entered into interim agreements with auDA, in particular 
          those for the .gov.au and .edu.au domains. There is a significant likelihood 
          of these agreements being quickly finalised once authority has been 
          transferred.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It concluded:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>auDA already has strong community and stakeholder support, and its 
          achievements to date show that it has the skills and experience necessary 
          to undertake the role. In addition, auDA has been able to meet, or put 
          in place the mechanisms necessary to meet, all of Government's objectives 
          for an industry self-regulatory body. The remaining impediment to auDA 
          assuming responsibility for the .au ccTLD is endorsement by Government 
          as the appropriate industry self-regulatory body. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In December 2000, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology 
        and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, <a href="http://www.auda.org.au/docs/Endorse_Letter_Final.html">formally 
        endorsed auDA</a> as the appropriate entity to manage the .au domain space. 
        This endorsement was memorialized in a <a href="/cctld/au/alston-to-watson-31dec00.htm">31 
        December 2000 agreement between auDA and the Government of Australia</a>, 
        by which the Government of Australia designated auDA to hold administrative 
        authority for the .au ccTLD.</p>
      <p>In parallel with these industry self-regulatory developments, on 7 December 
        2000, the Australian Parliament passed <a href="http://www.noie.gov.au/projects/information_economy/domains_au/Tlab.pdf">amendments</a> 
        to its Telecommunications Act of 1997 and the Australian Communications 
        Authority Act of 1997, both which clarified the Government's role regarding 
        the .au ccTLD among other &quot;electronic addressing&quot; services. 
        To this end, they amended the Australian Communications Authority Act 
        to give the Australian Communications Authority responsibility for managing 
        Internet addressing when instructed to do so by the Minister for Communications, 
        Information Technology, and the Arts, should self-regulation prove ineffective 
        in the future. While maintaining Australia's commitment to responsible 
        self-regulatory private-sector management structures in the communications 
        industry, these amendments were intended &quot;to establish safety net 
        mechanisms for management of electronic addressing, particularly Internet 
        addressing . . . .&quot; <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/ecita_ctte/tlab2000/02Ch1.pdf">Australia

        Legislation Committee, Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 
        Report (8 November 2000) &para; 1.2</a>.</p>
      <p>On 28 May 2001, auDA <a href="http://www.auda.org.au/redelegation/">formally 
        requested</a> the IANA to redelegate the .au ccTLD to auDA. That request 
        was accompanied by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <a href="http://www.auda.org.au/about/constitution.html">auDA Constitution</a>, 
          which serves as its organic charter;</li>
        <li>a Technical Report on the Provision of Domain Name Registration Services 
          in the .au ccTLD;</li>
        <li>a report, dated 15 March 2001, to the IANA entitled &quot;Transfer 
          of Authority for the .au ccTLD&quot;;</li>
        <li>the Australian Government's endorsement of auDA, dated 31 December 
          2000; and</li>
        <li>a summary of the amendments enacted in 2000 to the Australian telecommunications 
          laws.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>auDA's Chief Executive Officer, Chris Disspain, <a href="/cctld/au/disspain-to-alston-18jun01.htm">wrote 
        to Senator Alston</a> on 18 June 2001 requesting that the Australian Government 
        communicate its endorsement of auDA to ICANN. In that letter, Mr. Disspain 
        confirmed auDA's commitment to uphold its obligations towards the local 
        Internet community, as well as its commitment to the Government of Australia 
        to comply with the provisions outlining its obligations as the delegee 
        of the Government of Australia for the .au ccTLD (clause 9 of the Government 
        Advisory Committee (GAC) Principles for Delegation and Administration 
        of ccTLDs).</p>
      <p>In response to that letter of assurance, <a href="/cctld/au/alston-to-lynn-04jul01.htm">on 
        4 July 2001 Senator Alston wrote to ICANN</a> formally confirming the 
        Government of Australia's endorsement of auDA as the organization to administer 
        the .au ccTLD. The letter explained the rationale for its endorsement 
        of auDA as follows:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The auDA Board comprises a good cross-section of the Internet community, 
          deliberately having representation from the supply and demand side of 
          the industry, representative associations and the Internet community 
          in general. The Board has also appointed two Independent Directors, 
          Mr Tony Staley and Mr Greg Crew. A representative from NOIE attends 
          all auDA meetings as an observer and maintains a close working relationship 
          with the auDA Board and its administrative staff.</p>
        <p>In light of this I am confident that should a situation arise which 
          would suggest that auDA is no longer operating in the interest of the 
          global Internet community the Government would be made aware of this 
          and actions would be taken to resolve the matter. Guidance would also 
          be sought from ICANN on how best to deal with such a situation.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Senator Alston also noted that, while no time frame had been initially 
        specified for which auDA was to administer .au, it was:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>implied in the [31 December 2000] letter of endorsement that the timeframe 
          will be dependent upon auDA's adherence to the conditions set out in 
          the letter and operating within the provisions of its company Constitution. 
          This is confirmed in a recent letter I received from Mr Disspain, CEO, 
          auDA concerning auDA's commitment to clause 9 of the [ICANN Governmental 
          Advisory Committee] Principles.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In his letter, Senator Alston noted the pioneering efforts of the current 
        manager, Robert Elz, in promoting the evolution of the Internet in Australia 
        over the past two decades, making it appropriate for the management of 
        the .au ccTLD also to evolve to a more formally representative organization:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the significant 
          contribution made to the domain-name system by Mr Robert Elz, particularly 
          with regard to his administration of the .au ccTLD. The Government's 
          endorsement of auDA as the appropriate entity to administer the .au 
          ccTLD is not to be construed as criticism of Mr Elz. Rather it is recognition 
          that the task at hand is now too great for one person and is better 
          suited to an organisation which is representative of the Internet community 
          and has been established with the appropriate resources to move Australia 
          forward in the global world of the Internet with the full support of 
          Government.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Having received the auDA request for redelegation and the Governmental 
        endorsement, the IANA conducted an investigation and analysis of the circumstances 
        to supplement its monitoring of the ongoing discussion of the Australian 
        Internet community concerning evolution of the management of the .au ccTLD.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>This report is being provided under the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm">contract 
        for performance of the IANA function</a> between the United States Government 
        and ICANN. Under that contract, ICANN performs the IANA function, which 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/iana-contract-21mar01.htm#sow2.1.1.2">includes</a> 
        receiving delegation and redelegation requests concerning ccTLDs, investigating 
        the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting on the requests.</p>
      <p>In acting on redelegation requests, the IANA currently follows the practices 
        summarized in &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm">Internet 
        Domain Name System Structure and Delegation</a>&quot; (ICP-1). ICP-1 represents 
        an update of the portions of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1591.txt">RFC 
        1591</a> (which was issued in March 1994) dealing with ccTLDs, and reflects 
        subsequent documents and evolution of the policies followed by the IANA 
        through May 1999.</p>
      <p>In considering delegation or redelegation of a ccTLD, the IANA seeks 
        input from persons significantly affected by the transfer, particularly 
        those within the nation or territory which the ccTLD has been established 
        to benefit. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-1.htm#a">noted in 
        ICP-1</a>, the parties affected include especially the relevant government 
        or public authority: &quot;The desires of the government of a country 
        with regard to delegation of a ccTLD are taken very seriously. The IANA 
        will make them a major consideration in any TLD delegation/transfer discussions.&quot;</p>
      <p>Upon receiving auDA's redelegation request, the IANA consulted over several 
        weeks with the current manager of the .au ccTLD, Robert Elz. As the manager 
        of the .au ccTLD for 15 years, Mr. Elz has accumulated great familiarity 
        with the circumstances of the Australian Internet community and the .au 
        ccTLD. In addition, the IANA consulted with members of the Australian 
        Internet community, as well as seeking clarifications as necessary from 
        auDA and the Australian Government.</p>
      <p>Based on this investigation, it is the IANA's conclusion that there is 
        widespread&#151;nearly universal&#151;support for moving the delegation 
        of the .au ccTLD to an organization permitting broad participation of 
        the Australian Internet community in the development of policy for the 
        .au ccTLD. Although the .au ccTLD has developed well to date under the 
        personal stewardship of Mr. Elz, to achieve its future potential it should 
        be managed by an organization formally accountable to the Australian Internet 
        community. As <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/white-paper-05jun98.htm#TheNeedforChange">noted 
        in the U.S. Government's White Paper</a>, &quot;Internet names increasingly 
        have commercial value&quot; so that decisions about DNS policies and structure 
        &quot;cannot be made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by entities or individuals 
        that are not formally accountable to the Internet community.&quot; The 
        White Paper made this observation in 1998 to support the migration of 
        the IANA function from the personal stewardship of Jon Postel to the more 
        formalized structure of ICANN. Today <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.6">similar 
        considerations</a> support migrating the .au ccTLD delegation from Mr. 
        Elz to a formally accountable organization.</p>
      <p>auDA's structure is based on principles of private-sector self-regulation 
        of the type that have allowed and will continue to allow the Internet 
        globally to flourish. Its structure reflects the principle that the Internet 
        is best coordinated by private-sector efforts, with governments playing 
        a supportive and generally non-intervening role. That principle is embodied 
        in Australian Government policy, which endorses industry self-regulation, 
        with the Government serving to ensure that the self-regulation serves 
        the public interest.</p>
      <p>In February 2000, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/">ICANN 
        Governmental Advisory Committee</a> (GAC) issued a document entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm">Principles 
        for the Delegation and Administration of Country Code Top Level Domains</a>,&quot; 
        commonly known as the &quot;GAC Principles.&quot; These principles serve 
        as &quot;best practices&quot; to guide governments in assuming proper 
        roles with respect to the Internet's naming system, which the GAC has 
        observed is a public resource to be administered in the public interest. 
        In general, they recognize that each government has the ultimate responsibilty 
        within its territory for its national public-policy objectives, but also 
        that ICANN has the responsibility for ensuring that the Internet domain-name 
        system continues to provide an effective and interoperable global naming 
        system. The GAC Principles recommend that governments and ICANN pursue 
        their respective roles by creating a framework for accountability memorialized 
        in communications with each other and with the ccTLD manager (see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#2">clause 
        2</a>). The GAC Principles guide governments on how to responsibly structure 
        their relations with ccTLD managers (see clauses <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#5.5">5.5</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9">9</a>). 
        Among these specific principles, the best practices contemplate that governments 
        will assist in ensuring that the ccTLD manager complies with ICANN polices 
        related to global coordination of the Internet DNS (clauses <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.7">9.1.7</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#9.1.8">9.1.8</a>).</p>
      <p>These principles are reflected in Australian Government policy and contained 
        in the December 2000 amendments to its Telecommunications Act of 1997, 
        which confirm the Government's commitment to private-sector management 
        of the .au ccTLD while providing the Government with &quot;safety net&quot; 
        authority to intervene should the private sector be unable to fulfill 
        this function.</p>
      <p>The IANA's consultations with the Australian Internet community have 
        demonstrated substantial support for auDA's assumption of the role as 
        manager of the .au ccTLD. In consultations with the IANA, Mr. Elz has 
        acknowledged that the management of the .au ccTLD should be transferred 
        to a broadly supported organization.</p>
      <p>Mr. Elz, however, has expressed concern that auDA is still not fully 
        formed and that in practice its base of participants is not as broad as 
        desirable. <a href="http://melbourneit.com.au/">Melbourne IT</a>, a major 
        stakeholder in the Australian Internet community and operator of the principal 
        registry (.com.au) within the .au ccTLD, also <a href="/cctld/au/kloeden-to-lynn-03aug01.htm">expressed 
        concern</a> that auDA is a new, untested organization that may not prove 
        effective in broadly representing all parts of the Internet community. 
        Both Mr. Elz and Melbourne IT suggested that the management of the .au 
        ccTLD would more appropriately be performed directly by the Australian 
        Government. </p>
      <p>Because this suggestion for direct governmental management appeared contrary 
        to the Australian Government's stated desires, on 8 August 2001 Stuart 
        Lynn, ICANN's President, <a href="/cctld/au/lynn-to-alston-08aug01.htm">wrote 
        Senator Alston</a> requesting reconfirmation of the Australian Government's 
        endorsement of redelegation of .au to auDA. In a <a href="/cctld/au/alston-to-lynn-16aug01.htm">reply 
        letter dated 16 August 2001</a>, Senator Alston reaffirmed &quot;that 
        the Australian Government is committed to an industry self-regulatory 
        regime being responsible for the management of the .au domain space, rather 
        than a Government authority.&quot; Senator Alston's letter also reiterated 
        the Australian Government's endorsement of auDA as the appropriate vehicle 
        for that management and emphasized that the Australian Government took 
        seriously its responsibilty to ensure that auDA served the interests of 
        the Australian Internet community:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The Government's ongoing endorsement is subject to auDA continuing 
          to meet [stated criteria including inclusiveness of, and accountability 
          to, the Australian Internet community] as well as operating within the 
          provisions of its company constitution and recognizing that the management 
          and administration of the au ccTLD is subject to the ultimate authority 
          of the Commonwealth of Australia. Should the situation arise whereby 
          auDA was no longer administering the .au ccTLD for the benefit of the 
          Australian community, the Government would take the appropriate action 
          to remedy this situation, and has the legislative authority to do so.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In the letter, the Australian Government also recognizes the desirability 
        of private-sector technical coordination of the Internet on a global scale: 
        &quot;The Australian Government is committed to ICANN and considers it 
        to be the appropriate international entity to oversee the technical coordination 
        of the Internet in a manner that will preserve it as an effective and 
        convenient mechanism for global communication and commerce.&quot;</p>
      <p>According to the design described in its constitution, auDA is well-suited 
        to be inclusive of, and accountable to, the Australian Internet community 
        and to operate through open, transparent, and inclusive processes. Mr. 
        Elz's and Melbourne IT's concerns appear to be that auDA will not develop 
        according to this design. These concerns, however, are obviated by the 
        Australian Government's desire to have the .au ccTLD managed by the private 
        sector, combined with the Government's commitments that it will ensure 
        that auDA operates in an open, transparent, inclusive, and representative 
        way.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>The structure proposed by auDA and endorsed by the Australian Government 
        is to have auDA undertake management of the .au ccTLD under appropriate 
        oversight of the Australian Government (concerning national public-policy 
        interests) and ICANN (concerning global technical-coordination interests). 
        This structure is consonant with the principle of private-sector responsibility 
        for technical coordination under which the Internet has flourished. In 
        reviewing the request and in light of the Australian Government's endorsement 
        of auDA as the appropriate private-sector manager, the IANA concludes 
        that, provided auDA's commitment to these responsibilities is effectively 
        ensured, auDA is the appropriate delegee of the .au ccTLD.</p>
      <p>One mechanism to reflect these commitments is the arrangement embodied 
        in the GAC Principles. Where, as here, the relevant government is prepared 
        to carry out the ultimate responsibility for overseeing the ccTLD manager's 
        service to the local Internet community and the manager is prepared to 
        conduct itself within that framework, the interests of the local and global 
        Internet communities are served by ICANN joining into that cooperative 
        arrangement. </p>
      <p>Two of the three parts of that arrangement&#150;the auDA/Government and 
        Government/ICANN communications&#150;have already been implemented. Upon 
        conclusion of a mutually satisfactory agreement between ICANN and auDA 
        reflecting the principles set forth in clause 10 of the GAC principles, 
        adjusted as necessary to suit local circumstances, the .au ccTLD should 
        be redelgated to auDA. Once such an agreement is entered, the U.S. Department 
        of Commerce should establish revised procedures for maintenance of the 
        .au entry in the root zone file that enable ICANN to perform its obligations 
        under that agreement, and that permit moving forward responsibly with 
        the transition to private-sector technical management of the Internet.<br>
