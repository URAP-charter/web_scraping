      <p align="left">The Internet Assigned 
        Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative functions 
        associated with management of the domain-name system root, is responsible 
        for receiving requests for delegation and redelegation of top-level domains, 
        investigating the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and reporting 
        on the requests. </p>
      <p><b><a name="Background"></a>Background</b></p>
      <p>On 31 August 2001, the IANA 
        <a href="/reports/au-report-31aug01.htm">issued a report</a> on a Request 
        of the .au Domain Administration (auDA) for the Redelegation of .au Top 
        -Level Domain. In this report, the IANA concluded that</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The structure proposed by 
          auDA and endorsed by the Australian Government is to have auDA undertake 
          management of the .au ccTLD under appropriate oversight of the Australian 
          Government (concerning national public-policy interests) and ICANN (concerning 
          global technical-coordination interests). This structure is consonant 
          with the principle of private-sector responsibility for technical coordination 
          under which the Internet has flourished. In reviewing the request and 
          in light of the Australian Government's endorsement of auDA as the appropriate 
          private-sector manager, the IANA concludes that, provided auDA's commitment 
          to these responsibilities is effectively ensured, auDA is the appropriate 
          delegee of the .au ccTLD.</p>
        <p>One mechanism to reflect 
          these commitments is the arrangement embodied in the GAC Principles. 
          Where, as here, the relevant government is prepared to carry out the 
          ultimate responsibility for overseeing the ccTLD manager's service to 
          the local Internet community and the manager is prepared to conduct 
          itself within that framework, the interests of the local and global 
          Internet communities are served by ICANN joining into that cooperative 
          arrangement.</p>
        <p>Two of the three parts of 
          that arrangement-the auDA/Government and Government/ICANN communications-have 
          already been implemented. Upon conclusion of a mutually satisfactory 
          agreement between ICANN and auDA reflecting the principles set forth 
          in clause 10 of the GAC principles, adjusted as necessary to suit local 
          circumstances, the .au ccTLD should be redelgated to auDA. Once such 
          an agreement is entered, the U.S. Department of Commerce should establish 
          revised procedures for maintenance of the .au entry in the root zone 
          file that enable ICANN to perform its obligations under that agreement, 
          and that permit moving forward responsibly with the transition to private-sector 
          technical management of the Internet.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>On 4 September 2001, ICANN 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/au/proposed-sponsorship-agmt-04sep01.htm">posted 
        the proposed Sponsorship Agreement with auDA</a> for public comment. On 
        10 September, following its public forum, the ICANN Board authorized the 
        ICANN President to enter on behalf of ICANN the ccTLD Sponsorship Agreement 
        for .au with auDA as posted on the ICANN website, along with any minor 
        corrections or adjustments as appropriate.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> 
        The Board also authorized, upon signature of the agreement, the President 
        to take such actions as appropriate to implement the agreement.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> 
        On 25 October 2001, <a href="http://www.icann.org/cctlds/au/">the auDA-ICANN 
        agreement</a> was signed.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>With the achievement of this 
        agreement, the necessary framework of accountability has been achieved, 
        consistent with <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/gac/gac-cctldprinciples-23feb00.htm#10">clause 
        10 of the GAC Principles</a> concerning accountability of ICANN and ccTLD 
        trustees. Accordingly, the IANA concludes that the redelegation request 
        should now go forward.</p>
