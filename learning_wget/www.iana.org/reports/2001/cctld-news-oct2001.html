      <p> 
      <p>To all ccTLD Administrative and Technical Contacts:</p>
      <p>With this e-mail, we are resuming the ccTLD News Memo series that was 
        last active in 1998.</p>
      <p>This e-mail has two parts: (A) an <a href="#A">update on the program 
        for next month's ICANN meeting in Marina del Rey</a>; and (B) <a href="#B">an 
        invitation to the ccTLD community to initiate a bottom-up effort to assess 
        and improve ccTLD registry security practices</a>.</p>
      <p><b><a name="A"></a>(A) Update on November ICANN Meeting</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>We look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming ICANN meeting. 
          Following the usual round of constituency meetings on 11 and 12 November, 
          the focus of the meeting on 13-15 November will be on DNS security/integrity/resiliency 
          issues. We intend to make it participatory, with panel and roundtable 
          discussions, breakout working groups, and constituency meetings.</p>
        <p>The updated (but still tentative) <a href="http://www.icann.org/mdr2001/schedule.htm">schedule 
          for the meeting</a>, including panels topics, is as follows:</p>

        <p>As the schedule reflects, we are planning four panel sessions:</p>
        <p><b>(1) Root Name Server Security.</b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Description: Overview of present system, security aspects, short 
            term plans for enhanced security, longer term considerations.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>(2) DNS Security: Present and Future.</b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Description: Overview of current security aspects of domain nameservers 
            and plans for future security enhancements, such as DNSSEC.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>(3) TLD registry &amp; nameserver security.</b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Description: Overview of Registry operational &amp; nameserver security 
            considerations.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>(4) Registry/registrar recovery/restoration.</b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Description: Management of crisis situations (both preparation for 
            and recovery from), with an emphasis on post-Sept 11 threat analysis 
            and response.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Obviously, we are working to have ccTLD manager participation on panels 
          (3) and (4). Panel membership is being finalized by the program committee. 
          Schedule updates are being posted regularly at &lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/mdr2001">http://www.icann.org/mdr2001</a>&gt;.</p>
        <p>As you will note, we will be asking the ccTLD constituency to meet 
          on the afternoon of 14 November, to prepare for a public report on the 
          morning of 15 November. The agenda for that meeting and the report are, 
          of course, up to the ccTLD community. We anticipate that the ccTLDs 
          will work together to justify the confidence of the global Internet 
          community, and to evaluate what security-related efforts should be undertaken 
          by ccTLD managers, individually and collectively.</p>
        <p>In that regard, let me turn to the second, closely related topic of 
          this e-mail.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><a name="B"></a>(B) ccTLD Security Work</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>In the wake of 11 September, many people around the world are looking 
          at the Internet and saying: &quot;I depend on it. Is it secure, in the 
          face of crisis situations? Is it reliable?&quot; From the standpoint 
          of the DNS, we know that it is remarkably robust and resilient. The 
          underlying distributed architecture of the DNS is itself an enormously 
          powerful platform for stability and integrity. And we know that the 
          DNS registries include a number of very impressive, highly secure operations.</p>
        <p>At the same time, I think it is fair to say the following:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>(1) It is reasonable for Internet users, ISPs, governments, etc., 
            to ask about the security of the DNS and its registries.</p>
          <p>(2) To merit confidence among the user community, we have to be able 
            to explain the architecture of the DNS and the security work that 
            has already been done by the registries. We also have to evaluate 
            what additional steps can be done, and document what is expected of 
            registries in this area (i.e., in a &quot;best practices&quot; or 
            similar document). </p>
          <p>(3) There is always room for improvement; you can always learn from 
            the experiences of your peers (this applies to ICANN no less than 
            to the registries).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>With that in mind, ICANN is looking to the root nameserver operators, 
          the name and address registries, and the gTLD registrars to take seriously 
          the security worries of the global Internet's user communities, and 
          to develop, in a bottom-up way, standards and reports to justify the 
          confidence of those communities. Some of those groups have already begun 
          their work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Root Nameservers. Through the Root Server System AdvisoryCommittee 
            and various collaborators, the root nameserver operators are working 
            on a range of efforts to improve the overall stability and integrity 
            of the root nameservers. They will be reporting to the community by 
            way of a panel on 13 November.</li>
          <li> gTLD Registries. ICANN has asked the gTLD registries to prepare 
            reports on security-related topics. The gTLD registries have all agreed 
            to do so, and are collectively working on a Registry Best Practices 
            document that focuses on security. The gTLD constituency has also 
            formed a Registry Failure Task Force, which will examine ideas like 
            a &quot;buddy&quot; system.</li>
          <li> RIRs. The IP address registries have agreed to give a report focusing 
            on security.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because they are so much more numerous, however, we have not asked 
          the ccTLD registries or gTLD registrars to undertake any security-related 
          work in advance of the November meetings. But I do ask that you begin 
          to think about initiatives in the area of DNS registry security. As 
          a community, we must demonstrate that security issues are being given 
          adequate consideration by the TLD registries, ICANN, etc. <br>
          <br>
          At the November meeting, there will be two focus areas: one primarily 
          for a technically inclined audience that builds on panels addressing 
          issues relating to root-servers and DNSSEC; and another for a registry/registrar 
          managerial audience that builds on panels that cover nameserver security 
          and registry service recovery/restoration issues. Panel discussions, 
          and breakout session workshops, will occur for participants to address 
          the issues with colleagues and counterparts. Additionally, we are inviting 
          the constituencies to meet on the afternoon of 14 November, and to make 
          presentations to the community on 15 November.</p>
        <p>In sum, constituents within the ICANN community are being asked to 
          begin internal dialogues on their respective security issues. For example, 
          the gTLD registry constituency is discussing registry security and recovery 
          topics, Registry Best Practices, and will be providing a constituency 
          presentation on the status of their work. We know that many ccTLDs already 
          have effective practices in place regarding security issues, both for 
          protection from potential threats and the recovery/restoration in crisis 
          situations.</p>
        <p>In similar fashion, we want to encourage the ccTLD registries to begin 
          a community dialogue about ccTLD registry security issues, especially 
          from a ccTLD manager's standpoint and at the national level. Existing 
          practices should be addressed, exploring whether there are common standards. 
          For example, can we identify standard ccTLD registry measures relating 
          to protection against potential threats, such as site security, network 
          security, or management and personnel practices? Can we identify standard 
          practices by ccTLDs to recover from actual serious failures, such as 
          data backup, data escrow, or recovery procedures and processes. What 
          reporting mechanisms should we expect? We note that the ccTLD constituency 
          of the DNSO has already done work in this area, as have some of the 
          regional ccTLD organizations. The <a href="http://www.wwtld.org/ongoing/bestpractices/20010310.BestPractice.html">constituency's 
          Best Practice Guidelines</a> identifies some of these issues, for example, 
          in Section 3.3 (&quot;Operational Requirements&quot;).</p>

        you have any questions or like to explore areas of discussion.</p>
