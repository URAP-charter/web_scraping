<h1>Delegation of the .台灣 and .台湾 (“Taiwan”) domains representing Taiwan, Province of China in Chinese to Taiwan Network Information Center</h1>
<p>ICANN has received a request to delegate 台灣 and 台湾 as country-code top-level domains representing Taiwan, Province of China to Taiwan Network Information Center. ICANN Staff have assessed the request, and provide this report for the ICANN Board of Directors to consider.
</p>
<h2>Factual Information</h2>

<h3>Country</h3>
<p>The “TW” ISO 3166-1 code, from which this application’s eligibility derives, is designated for use to represent Taiwan, Province of China.</p>
<h3>String</h3>
<p>The two domains under consideration for delegation at the DNS root level are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The string “台灣”, as represented in ASCII-compatible encoding according to the 2003 IDNA specification as “xn--kpry57d”. The individual Unicode code points that comprise this string are U+53F0 U+7063. The string is expressed in Chinese script, using traditional characters.</li>
<li>The string “台湾”, as represented in ASCII-compatible encoding according to the 2003 IDNA specification as “xn--kprw13d”. The individual Unicode code points that comprise this string are U+53F0 U+6E7E. The string is expressed in Chinese script, using simplified characters.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Chinese language, both strings have a meaning and pronunciation equivalent to “Taiwan” in English.</p>
<h3>Chronology of events</h3>
<p>The Taiwan Network Information Center was created by the Ministry of Transportation and Communication and the Computer Society in 1999.</p>
<p>An application was made for the proposed strings, plus a number of variants, to the IDN Fast Track string selection process. In support of that application, community support was provided by the Internet Society Taiwan Chapter, Net-Chinese — an accredited registrar, and the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises. As part of the consultation process, a survey was conducted along with focus group discussions. The survey resulted in 86% support indicating support for “台灣” as the appropriate string to represent the country as an internationalised top-level domain. Other considered alternatives included “福爾摩沙” (“Formosa”) and “台灣國” (Republic of Taiwan).</p>
<p>On 6 January 2010, review by the IDN Fast Track DNS Stability Panel found that “the applied-for strings (a) present none of the threats to the stability and security of the DNS ... but (b) are all variants of each other which, if separately delegated, would present an unacceptably high risk of user confusion.” Following this determination, ICANN staff sought to undertake a review on how these strings may be delegated together.</p>
<p>On 22 March 2010, ICANN announced a “Proposed Implementation Plan for Synchronised IDN ccTLDs”, which would provide for a new concept of “synchronised IDN ccTLDs” that would allow for delegation of multiple labels that are “considered equivalent”, where the delegation of the multiple labels would solve significant problems for Internet users, and the operation of the multiple labels would be expected to be operate in the same way (i.e. resolve with the same data). A public comment period was held to seek feedback on the idea, with this work ongoing.</p>
<p>On 22 April 2010, the ICANN Board of Directors passed a resolution concerning the proposed two strings that read, in part:</p>
<blockquote><i>
<p>Whereas, there is general and wide community support for the notion of simultaneously delegating this particular requested pair of IDN ccTLDs to meet the well understood needs of users of Chinese, namely that users accessing a domain expect that the traditional and simplified Chinese names have been assigned to the same registrant, and that such delegations would solve a significant problem for the user communities;</p>
<p>Whereas, public comment makes it clear that the methodology for operation and management of IDN ccTLDs based on such parallel strings can only be achieved today through operational and administrative procedures, as there are no DNS protocol mechanisms yet that provide the desired behavior, which procedures must be handled by the local IDN ccTLD manager;</p>
<p>Whereas, the delegation of these IDN ccTLDs would be an extension to the current published IDN ccTLD Fast Track Process;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Whereas, the methodology to be taken by the IDN ccTLD manager to handle these particular instances of parallel IDN ccTLDs is, in the short-term, the only option available, but there are serious limits to where such an approach is viable in practice, so that it cannot be viewed as a general solution, and that consequently, long-term development work should be pursued;</p>
<p>Whereas, significant analysis and possibly development work should continue on both policy-based and technical elements of a solution for the introduction on a more general basis of strings containing variants as TLDs;</p>
<p>Therefore, it is RESOLVED, (2010.04.22.11), that TWNIC be notified that .台灣 (xn--kpry57d) and .台湾 (xn--kprw13d) IDN ccTLD request has completed the Fast Track String Evaluation and that they may enter the String Delegation step in the Fast Track Process, using the standard IANA ccTLD delegation function, and that delegation is contingent on completion of the IANA process criteria and publication of TWNIC's detailed Implementation Plan to be finalized in consultation with ICANN.</p>
</i></blockquote>
<p>On 24 May 2010, Taiwan Network Information Center presented an application to ICANN for delegation of “台灣” and “台湾” as top-level domains.</p>
<h3>Proposed Sponsoring Organisation and Contacts</h3>
<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation is Taiwan Network Information Center, a not for profit organisation in Taiwan, Province of China.</p>
<p>The proposed administrative contact is Ai-Chin Lu, Vice CEO of Taiwan Network Information Center. The administrative contact is understood to be based in Taiwan, Province of China.</p>
<p>The proposed technical contact is Nai-Wen Hsu, Directory of the Technology Department of Taiwan Network Information Center.</p>


<h2>Evaluation of the Request</h2>
<h3>String Eligibility</h3>
<p>The strings “台灣” and “台湾” were deemed eligible for delegation specifically by Taiwan Network Information Center by the ICANN Board of Directors through its resolution on 22 April 2010, that “...that [Taiwan Network Information Center] may ... [use] the standard IANA ccTLD delegation [process], and that delegation is contingent on completion of the IANA process criteria and publication of [the applicant’s] detailed Implementation Plan to be finalized in consultation with ICANN.”</p>
<p>This report does not consider the resolution’s requirement for publication of an Implementation Plan, and only considers the IANA process criteria.</p>
<h3>Public Interest</h3>
<p>Governmental support for this application has been provided by Chi-Kuo Mao, Minister of Transportation and Communication. The Ministry is responsible for establishing policies, formulating laws and regulations, and overseeing communications.</p>
<p>The application is the result of resolutions by the applicant’s board of directors during 2009, which directed the company’s staff to apply for the IDN ccTLD in accordance with the announced implementation plan. The Board is comprised of 19-23 directors from government, academia, Internet-related organisations and Internet Service Providers.</p>
<p>Indications of support for the application have been received from the Taiwan Internet Association, and the Taiwan Chapter of the Internet Society; however it does not appear there was wide-ranging consultation considering alternatives to the applicant to operate the proposed top-level domains.</p>
<p>The application is consistent with known applicable local laws in Taiwan, Province of China.</p>
<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation undertakes to continue to operate the domain in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
<h3>Based in country</h3>
<p>The proposed sponsoring organisation is constituted in Taiwan, Province of China. The proposed administrative contact is understood to be resident in Taiwan, Province of China. The registry is to be operated in the country.</p>
<h3>Stability</h3>
<p>This application does not involve a transfer of domain operations from an existing domain registry, and therefore stability aspects relating to registry transfer have not been evaluated.</p>
<p>The application is not known to be contested.</p>
<h3>Competency</h3>
<p>Taiwan Network Information Center has experience in domain name operations, including operation of the .TW top-level domain, and technical operation of the .KN top-level domain. Satisfactory information on the applicant’s technical and operational competency has been provided.</p>

<h2>Evaluation Procedure</h2>
<p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is tasked with managing the Domain Name System root zone as part of a set of functions governed by a contract with the U.S. Government. This includes managing the delegations of top-level domains.</p>
<p>A subset of top-level domains are designated for the local Internet communities in countries to operate in a way that best suits their local needs. These are known as country-code top-level domains, and are assigned by ICANN to responsible trustees (known as “Sponsoring Organisations”) who meet a number of public-interest criteria for eligibility. These criteria largely relate to the level of support the trustee has from their local Internet community, their capacity to ensure stable operation of the domain, and their applicability under any relevant local laws.</p>
<p>Through an ICANN department known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), requests are received for delegating new country-code top-level domains, and redelegating or revoking existing country-code top-level domains. An investigation is performed on the circumstances pertinent to those requests, and, when appropriate, the requests are implemented. Decisions on whether to implement requests are made by the ICANN Board of Directors, taking into account ICANN’s core mission of ensuring the stable and secure operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems.</p>
<h3>Purpose of evaluations</h3>
<p>The evaluation of eligibility for country-code top-level domains, and of evaluating responsible trustees charged with operating them, is guided by a number of principles. The objective of the assessment is that the action enhances the secure and stable operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems. The evolution of the principles has been documented in “Domain Name System Structure and Delegation” (RFC 1591), “Internet Domain Name System Structure and Delegation” (ICP-1), and other informational memoranda.</p>
<p>In considering requests to delegate or redelegate country-code top-level domains, input is sought regarding the proposed Sponsoring Organisation, as well as from persons and organisations that may be significantly affected by the change, particularly those within the nation or territory to which the ccTLD is designated.</p>
<p>The assessment is focussed on the capacity for the proposed sponsoring organisation to meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The domain should be operated within the country, including having its sponsoring organisation and administrative contact based in the country.</li>
<li>The domain should be operated in a way that is fair and equitable to all groups in the local Internet community.</li>
<li>Significantly interested parties in the domain should agree that the prospective trustee is the appropriate party to be responsible for the domain, with the desires of the national government taken very seriously.</li>
<li>The domain must be operated competently, both technically and operationally. Management of the domain should adhere to relevant technical standards and community best practices.</li>
<li>Risks to the stability of the Internet addressing system must be adequately considered and addressed, particularly with regard to how existing identifiers will continue to function.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method of evaluation</h3>
<p>To assess these criteria, information is requested from the applicant regarding the proposed sponsoring organisation and method of operation. In summary, a request template is sought specifying the exact details of the delegation being sought in the root zone. In addition, various documentation is sought describing: the views of the local internet community on the application; the competencies and skills of the trustee to operate the domain; the legal authenticity, status and character of the proposed trustee; and the nature of government support fort he proposal. The view of any current trustee is obtained, and in the event of a redelegation, the transfer plan from the previous sponsoring organisation to the new sponsoring organisation is also assessed with a view to ensuring ongoing stable operation of the domain.</p>
<p>After receiving this documentation and input, it is analysed in relation to existing root zone management procedures, seeking input from parties both related to as well as independent of the proposed sponsoring organisation should the information provided in the original application be deficient. The applicant is given the opportunity to cure any deficiencies before a final assessment is made.</p>
<p>Once all the documentation has been received, various technical checks are performed on the proposed sponsoring organisation’s DNS infrastructure to ensure name servers are properly configured and are able to respond to queries for the top-level domain being requested. Should any anomalies be detected, ICANN staff will work with the applicant to address the issues.</p>
<p>Assuming all issues are resolved, an assessment is compiled providing all relevant details regarding the proposed sponsoring organisation and its suitability to operate the top-level domain being requested. This assessment is submitted to ICANN’s Board of Directors for its determination on whether to proceed with the request.</p>
