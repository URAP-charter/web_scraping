We are also developing a tertiary color palette – colors other than the ones mentioned above – that are available to complement our primary and secondary color palettes. Those tertiary colors include a sky blue and a wide range of silver/grays.', ' One of the important features of the current branding program is that the College has significantly cut back on the number of department- or program-level logos. This creates for a much more unified, compelling brand and adheres to “best practice” in large organizations (whether in higher education or in the corporate world). While the rebrand “took away” some logos from units that may have previously had their own, distinctive look and feel, it now allows all elements of Polk State – from our pre-collegiate programs for 5th graders to our non-degree programs for corporate partners to our athletics program to our various service units to the President’s Office to… — you see what we mean!

Because our students are awesome, and they deserve the very best. You are awesome, and you, too, deserve the very best.', ' Program Mission Statement', ' The protection and cultivation of a brand is a never-ending task. (Imagine what would happen if you started printing homemade Mickey Mouse t-shirts in your garage: as big as Disney is, they will always make time to prosecute anyone who infringes on the brand, no matter how small the “infringement” may be.) It is also a very worthwhile task. The more vigilantly we nurture a brand, the more valuable it becomes. If Nike tolerated rampant counterfeiting, the value of their sneakers would plummet. Because they protect the brand to the extent possible, consumers are willing to pay a premium to experience the brand. In Polk State’s case, we do not protect the brand in hopes of charging more but in hopes of causing students, employers, donors, alumni, etc. to see more and more value in what we do.', ' Downloadable Media\\nThe following logos may be used by Polk State personnel in accordance with the guidelines articulated above.
