				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Southwest Schools has received a Rating of “<strong>Superior</strong>” from the Texas Education Agency for its 2015-2016 fiscal year School FIRST (Financial Integrity Rating System of Texas) for its excellence in fiscal management according to state guidelines. The School First Report is based on 20 indicators which gives a district a numerical value. The purpose of the financial accountability rating system, known as the School Financial Integrity Rating System of Texas (FIRST), is to ensure that open-enrollment charter schools are held accountable for the quality of their financial management practices and that they improve those practices. The system is designed to encourage Texas public and charter schools to better manage their financial resources in order to provide the maximum allocation possible for direct instructional purposes. Southwest Schools’ Business Department continues to strive for excellence and transparency. This state award is evident that employees are committed to financial responsibility and to meeting state guidelines.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://latinwomensinitiative.org/" target="_blank">Latin Women&#8217;s Initiative</a> awarded a generous grant in the amount of $15,000 to Southwest Schools to support the district&#8217;s Summer Reading Program.</p>
<p>The program aims to help children and teens retain and enhance their reading skills over the summer. Research has shown that kids who participate in these programs are <a href="https://lexile.com/about-lexile/grade-equivalent/" target="_blank">52 Lexile</a> points ahead of their peers who do not. Summer reading programs are also an antidote for learning loss. So instead of losing knowledge and skills during the summer months, kids who attend reading programs actually show gains.</p>

<p>PLTW is a nonprofit organization that provides a transformative learning experience for K-12 students and teachers across the U.S.  Among other significant findings, independent research studies reveal that PLTW students outperform their peers in school, are better prepared for post-secondary studies, and are more likely to consider careers as scientists, technology experts, engineers, mathematicians, healthcare providers, and researchers compared to their non-PLTW peers.</p>
<p>STEM education is key to keeping the U.S. competitive. Project Lead The Way offers students and educators world-class curricula and teacher training to help kids obtain the in-demand, transferable skills they need to excel. Chevron is proud to partner with Project Lead The Way to help provide access to engineering curriculum to 100,000 students across the U.S.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to be included as a part of Project GRAD Houston&#8217;s grant announcement &#8211; wonderful news for all of our students!</p>
<p><strong>The Mission of Project GRAD</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Project GRAD improves lives in low-income communities by helping students develop and achieve their educational aspirations.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Mission of Project GRAD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More than 6,750 have enrolled in college with Project GRAD’s support.</li>
<li>More than 1,900 GRAD Scholars have graduated college.</li>
<li>More than 2,000 GRAD Scholars are currently enrolled in college and pursuing their degrees.</li>
<li>GRAD Scholars are on track to achieve a 60% college completion rate – nearly 2.5 times the rate of their peers throughout Texas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Grant</strong></p>
<p>AT&amp;T’s Aspire Initiative is a national initiative focused on increasing high school success for at-risk populations.  Project GRAD and AT&amp;T have been partners for the last 7 years in working together to improve high school success for Houstonians.  AT&amp;T is awarding Project GRAD Houston with a two-year $1,000,000 grant to expand GRAD support to students enrolled in <strong>Southwest High School</strong> (among others).  GRAD will work collaboratively with school and district faculties and staff, community organizations, and area colleges and universities to reach an additional 1,735 Latino high school students considered “at-risk,” resulting in increased college readiness and high school graduation rates.</p>
