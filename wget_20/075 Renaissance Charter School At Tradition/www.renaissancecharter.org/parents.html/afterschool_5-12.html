    <h1>5-12 Afterschool Program</h1>
    <p>The philosophy of our extended day is to follow the students’ passions aligned with the curricular needs of the school.  Students and teachers are empowered to suggest clubs and classes and then we match up the staff to the ideas.  Long-standing Renaissance clubs such as Botball, TREA and various Athletics are offered every year.  Our 11th and 12th graders meet regularly with college advisors, engage in internships and take College Now classes at nearby CUNYs.</p>

<p>Performing Arts Conservatory of New York (PACONY) will provide private, on-site music lessons for a fee.  Download the request form <a href="http://www.renaissancecharter.org/files/PACONY.doc" class="None" title="HERE">HERE</a>.</p>

<p><strong>5th-10th Grade After School Program!</strong></p>

<p>Renaissance partners with 82nd Street Academics to bring a high-quality, thoughtfully planned and staffed after-school program.  The 2016-17 school year will continue operating under the inspiration of our "Mountain Metaphor", as introduced in this video, created by 82SA exclusively for Renaissance parents and students: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3W9r6gFecg">82SA Mountain Experience</a></p>

<p>Our middle school after-school program is the recipient of an "SONYC" grant from New York City Department of Youth and Cultural Development. We are excited to add more challenging and engaging content to our middle school program, including elective classes; Science and Technology projects developed by our own Science department; leadership Development from the Sadie Nash Young Women's Leadership Project; Athletics, free choice time and more!</p>

<p>As part of our goal to create leaders and college-ready, academically competitive students for the 21st century, Renaissance has restructured our after-school for all 5th through 10th grade students. Whereas before, Renaissance students were encouraged to ‘drop-in’ to a wide range of clubs, homework centers and tutoring opportunities, this year we are enrolling students in a comprehensive academic program that will increase student enthusiasm for higher learning. Our Community Based Organization partners at 82nd Street Academics are in coordination with our teachers and staff to lead this program. This will be the 4th year in a successful partnership!</p>

<p>We have designed After School learning opportunities that support the Renaissance mission and culture and are those that challenge students to think beyond their comfort zone, hone their skills so they are confident of their abilities. This year, students will be interacting with the theme, “Climb Your Mountain.”  Student attendance will determine what type of group they will participate in, we have we have an Avalanche Homework Center and specialized Premium Groups available.</p>

<p>The Avalanche Homework Center will be based on homework completion along with enhancement literacy skills. Students in this program will receive a meal and be challenge their literacy skills through book clubs. Teachers will be available to help with daily homework assignments. All students will start in The Avalanche Group, with the opportunity to advance to the Premium Group starting in October.</p>

<p>The Premium Groups are open to students who maintain 90% attendance in our Avalanche Group on a first come, first serve basis. This group includes academic tutoring, social-emotional skill building, book clubs and outdoor excursions. Students who are accepted into the Premium Group will need to continue to maintain a 90% attendance rate. Academic performance will be monitored closely so that students are motivated to complete assignments and take personal accountability for their work. This program will be challenging but there will be several incentives along the way to keep students motivated.</p>

<p>It is important for parents and students to know that we will require a commitment to attending the program every day, unless excused by parent notice for scheduled out of school activities.</p>

<p>Any questions, please contact Jessica Kim jessica.kim@82ndst.com. See more information about 82nd Street Academics at 82nd Street Academics.</p>
