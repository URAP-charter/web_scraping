				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is fitting that <em>National Charter Schools Week a</em>nd <em>Teacher Appreciation Week</em> fall during the same week this year. President Obama declared this week <strong>National Charter Schools Week, May 4-10, 2014</strong>.  Parents, students, and community members owe a great deal to successful charter schools, charter school pioneers, and charter school teachers. Arguably, the most important reason to celebrate charter schools is they offer educational choice to families otherwise restricted to a failing school because of their zip code.  Fortunately, because of early charter school pioneers and supporters, there are now over 2.5 million students enrolled in more than 6,000 charter schools nationally (<em>Source: National Association of Public Charter Schools, www.public charters.org</em>). One in twenty students now attends a public charter school. More reasons to support and celebrate charter schools this week and always are below:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Charter schools empower parents and students.</strong> Children should not be limited to a failing school because of their zip code.  Where a child lives should not determine whether a child receives a quality education.  Charters offer parents educational choice and educational mobility. Charters empower families.</p>
<p>2) <strong>One size does not fit all; different kids <span style="text-decoration: underline;">need</span> different schools.</strong>  Many traditional public schools do a decent job of educating most of their kids.  But many schools don&#8217;t, and even in high performing school districts, there are children who suffer academically, socially, emotionally, through bullying, or for other reasons. Charter schools provide a unique programmatic opportunity for students who were otherwise not always successful in their previous school and for parents who were dissatisfied in their child&#8217;s previous school. After all, if parents were satisfied with their previous school, they wouldn&#8217;t enroll their child in a charter school.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Achievement outcomes are higher in many charter schools.</strong> School choice improves student achievement. Countries like Finland, Belgium, and Australia, where parents actively choose their schools have better schools. (See &#8220;Education Myths&#8221;, Jay P. Greene).</p>
<p>4) <strong>Charter schools often provide smaller class sizes, and equally important, smaller school sizes.  </strong>Parents care about strong academics, but they care about other important factors as well.  These include safety, opportunities to be involved in their child&#8217;s education, frequent communication between home and school, and more. What smaller class sizes and smaller school sizes mean to parents are often more opportunities for parent involvement, better home and school communication, and more opportunities to focus on other facets arguably as important as academic achievement. Such factors may include character education, anti-bullying programs, school safety, niche programs (such as music, art, fitness, or technology), greater access to teachers and administrators, and stronger school/family relationships.  Moreover, parents report real and tangible benefits related to the fact that nearly everyone in the building may know their particular child, including the school administrators, support staff, and classroom teachers.</p>
<p>5) <strong>Charter schools are a bargain to the American taxpayer; charter schools do much more with less money</strong>.  Charter schools efficiently deliver quality education to students with fewer resources. In 2011, charters received $3059 less per student than traditional public schools (in urban districts, that figure is much higher), and that disparity has grown by 55% since 2007.  All states, except for Tennessee, gave more money to traditional public schools than charter schools (See: University of Arkansas Dep. of Ed Reform study). Charter schools are more economical to the taxpayer, and they are more efficient.  Most charters are unable to access local tax levy revenue like the local districts, and most receive significantly fewer dollars per pupil to educate students. Most importantly, children were never meant to receive an education through the churning of huge district wheels designed to crank out thousands of kids.  The necessary and associated burdens of huge administrative overhead costs take away from classrooms. Children are not widgets. The layers and layers of bureaucracy, policies, and systems designed to meet the needs of thousands of kids in a district or a building for a thousand students make no sense.</p>
<p>6) <strong>Charter schools are bound by the ultimate accountability consequence&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">closure</span> for poor academic outcomes tied to a limited period of time.</strong> Many behemoth, failing, traditional public school districts continue to produce high drop out rates, students who can&#8217;t read by the third grade, and poor overall academic results for kids.  Many of these schools are not safe from bullying or threats. How long should that be permitted to continue?  Should traditional districts be given two years to get it together before they close like many charters schools? Should they be given 5 years, 10 years?  What is our tolerance for public schools with no consequence for academic failure? Many have had poor outcomes for decades with no real consequence that sticks.  Charter schools are held to the highest level of accountability for poor academic outcomes. They actually have their funding taken away, and they actually close for poor performance.  More importantly, we are seeing &#8220;loft&#8221; in the charter community over time as quality charter schools continue to rise and provide more quality options for parents and students.</p>
<p>National Charter Schools Week 2014 is indeed a great time to recognize the power and opportunities inherent in charter schools for parents and students. With one million students on charter school waiting lists nationwide, it is clear parents desire educational choice.  <strong>Celebrate your charter school and your charter school teachers today!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ohio educators, charter and traditional alike, are in the throes of overseeing high stakes testing on the state mandated Ohio Achievement Assessments (OAA) this week.  Meanwhile, many are already looking ahead to next year and considering the requirements, implications, and proper implementation of the new Third Grade Reading Guarantee.</p>
<p>The new Third Grade Reading Guarantee incorporates many researched based instructional practices of which Ohio educators can be proud.  The spirit of this sweeping legislation is good and right for kids<b>.  Every child should be able to read by the time he or she completes third grade.  </b>There is ample literature and evidence to support that a child who cannot read by the end of third grade is at risk for poor achievement in other subjects, as well as dropping out of school later on (See Annie Casey Foundation study, 2013).  <a title="Early Warning Confirmed: A Research Update on Third Grade Reading" href="http:/Early Warning Confirmed: A Research Update on Third-Grade Reading http://www.aecf.org/knowledgecenter/publications.aspx?pubguid=%7B58440238-1626-476f-afda-155d2185fb3a%7D#.U1q6Bop5eJM.twitter">http://www.aecf.org/knowledgecenter/publications.aspx?pubguid=%7B58440238-1626-476f-afda-155d2185fb3a%7D#.U1q6Bop5eJM.twitter<i> Warning Confirmed—A Research Update on Third-Grade Reading by the Annie Casey Foundation, 2013</i>)</a>.</p>
<p>The parts of this new mandate that emphasize early identification, early intervention and literacy represent important shifts in the way Ohio educators think about improving reading achievement in grades K-3. Creating a safety net early and delivering quality reading interventions to the students who need it the most are critical. Too many children in Ohio can&#8217;t read by the time they finish third grade. That is unacceptable.</p>
<p>However, practical challenges loom for educators in implementing portions of the Third Grade Reading Guarantee as it currently stands.  More importantly, the implications and long term ramifications of potentially retaining hundreds or even thousands of Ohio’s third graders next year must be thoughtfully considered.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical Implementation Challenges for Schools</span></b></p>
<p>1) <b>A significant number of kindergarten students who have not attended preschool or Headstart may qualify for a reading intervention plan (known as a RIMP) once assessed on the new Kindergarten Readiness test in the fall.</b>  The early identification of language and literacy deficits in kindergarteners on this new kindergarten test represents a move in the right direction (see, Deeper Assessment for Ohio’s Kindergarteners—Columbus Dispatch, April, 2014)<br />
<a title="Deeper Assessment for Ohio's Kindergarteners" href="http:/ http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/04/25/deeper-assessment-for-kindergartners.html">http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/04/25/deeper-assessment-for-kindergartners.html</a></p>
<p>However, the need for intensive interventions for large numbers of kindergarteners under the new provisions of 3GRG may be great for some districts and charters. This means more qualified reading teachers, more qualified interventionists and support staff must be hired quickly to delivery the required interventions in the fall.  Schools will have to amp up their rosters over the summer to be prepared. This may be particularly financially burdensome for small traditional school districts or charter schools with small budgets or small numbers of staff where there is a high need for intervention.</p>
<p>2) <b>Summer enrollment efforts and building class rosters over the summer may present significant challenges for schools who accept transfer students from other districts.</b> There is no “virtual record” for students in Ohio, so when a student transfers to another district or to another charter, the new school may be unaware if the child passed the OAA in third grade or not until the sending district submits those scores in response to a records request from the new school.  Therefore, a child could potentially be placed in a 4<sup>th</sup> grade classroom, when in fact under the new 3GRG, he/she should have been retained in the 3<sup>rd</sup> grade with intensive reading interventions.  Test results for the OAA reading test that 3<sup>rd</sup> graders are taking now will not be available until mid to late June.  Grade cards alone will not have information about student passage or failure on the reading OAA.</p>
<p>3) <b>Charters in particular may face difficulties related to proper placement of students in the appropriate grade in the summertime when students transfer in from traditional districts</b>.  Many charters receive heavy enrollment over the summer. For some, summer enrollees represent about 1/3 or more of their enrollment, particularly if they are in growth mode.  Often, traditional districts do not respond to records requests from charters in July, and charters may not receive student records until fall or well after school starts.  This is particularly true for charters with early start dates. It is not unusual for a charter school office manager or principal to physically go to a district office to request records in person following multiple requests for records in the summer.  This is not a slam against traditional districts.  It is simply plainly observed experience for many Ohio charters in many districts. (This also presents significant challenges for proper implementation of IEPs for students in special education, but that is a piece for another day.)</p>
<p>4) <b>The challenges related to receiving timely records and test results may also impact a school’s ability to solidify a staff roster and to allocate appropriate classroom space</b>.  This will be particularly tricky for charters and small traditional districts to sort out before the first day of school. For example, if a charter school is full in 3rd grade and erroneously enrolls a student in 4th grade due to lack of a virtual record for a student who actually failed the 3rd grade reading OAA, it may prove challenging to pivot and move a student down to a 3rd grade class that is full after school starts.</p>
<p>5) <b>Building a calendar with a reasonable and effective number of instructional days for 2014-2015 may be challenging for traditional public and charter public schools alike</b>.  For example, our academic calendar this year reflected 28 allotted testing days for students.  Next year’s calendar has <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">78 days of testing allotted to meet the new requirements of 3GRG and the new PARCC assessments associated with the Common Core.</span></i></b>  While every child won&#8217;t necessarily test every single day, significant amounts of testing will be occurring each of those days in all of our buildings. Significantly more human and capital resources will be spent on testing. Enough said.</p>
<p>6) <b>Building a calendar with a reasonable number of PLC days may be challenging for some schools for the same reason as above.  </b>PLC days are “professional learning community days”. Effective schools use PLC meetings as a means for teachers to review student data. The purpose is to improve and inform ongoing quality instruction based on the data reviewed in the PLC.  Chipping into precious time for teachers who ought to be laser focused on their students’ academic data may be problematic for some schools.</p>
<p>7) <b>Students will be required to be held back in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade even if they are on track in math, science, and social studies for 4<sup>th</sup> grade. </b>This may be an especially “sticky wicket” for teachers, EMIS Coordinators, parents, and students on many practical levels.  The devil will be in the details of implementation, providing proper differentiated instruction across grade levels, etc.<b>  </b>Presently, there is confusing guidance about mid-year promotion policies for students.  Parents should also be considered in such a monumental decision for their child.  Presently, it appears they will not have a voice.</p>
<p><b></b><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">8) </span><b style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The big kahuna:</span></b><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">  </span><b style="line-height: 1.5em;">Not all students with disabilities will be exempt from the retention requirement of the 3GRG.</b><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">  Presently,  it appears only students with severe cognitive delays or severe disabilities will be exempt from the retention component of the 3GRG.  In practice, IEP teams are being actively discouraged from exempting students with other disabilities from the retention requirement. <strong>That means students with mild to moderate disabilities, such as dyslexia or specific learning disability (SLD) or mild forms of autism, such as Asperger’s, or students with ADHD will not be exempt from being retained if they fail the third grade Reading OAA and subsequent diagnostic tests. </strong> (Third graders will still take the old pencil and paper OAA next year for reading, but not for math.  For math, third graders will take the new PARCC assessment on the computer.)</span></p>
<p><i>Whether one thinks it is appropriate to “flunk” a student with a disability (based on the “almost old” OAA Reading test) I suppose is a personal decision.  But from my point of view as a special educator and parent of a student with a disability, the potential harm over good here is strongly tipped toward harm.</i></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical, Moral, and Research-Based Instructional Implications for Potentially Retaining  Large Numbers of Ohio Third Graders Next Year</span></b></p>
<p><b>There is no evidence that retention as an intervention improves reading achievement over time. Let me say that again.  There is no evidence that retention improves reading achievement over time.</b> As someone trained 20 years ago in the field of school psychology, it was hammered into my brain that nearly a century of research strongly indicates student retention as an intervention for reading achievement was literally 0 for retention to hundreds against.  Meta analyses of student retention studies (empirical studies of hundreds of studies over decades on one variable&#8211;retention) tell us retention doesn’t improve reading achievement.  <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In fact, the unintended consequences of retention are real and troubling, including the very thing we seek to avoid—higher drop out rates</span></b>, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not to mention poor social adjustment, poorer attendance, and more behavior problems </span></b>(see also, Annie Casey study, 2013, above). We therefore must carefully consider the long term impact of potentially retaining hundreds, perhaps thousands of third graders next year.  They may indeed become the high school dropouts of the future.</p>
<p>Today, more than 20 years later after I was in graduate school studying school psychology, special education, and school policy, it is still the position of the National Association for School Psychologists (NASP) that educators should use methods other than grade retention (and social promotion) to ensure that all students succeed (see NASP retention policy)<br />
<a title="NASP Retention Policy" href="http:/ http://www.nasponline.org/about_nasp/positionpapers/GradeRetentionandSocialPromotion.pdf ">http://www.nasponline.org/about_nasp/positionpapers/GradeRetentionandSocialPromotion.pdf .</a></p>
<p><b>Suggested alternatives to retention and social promotion from NASP include:</b></p>
<p><b>-Intensive, evidence based instruction and intervention to meet the needs of all students</b></p>
<p><b></b><b>-Equitable opportunities to learn for students from diverse backgrounds</b></p>
<p><b>-Universal screening for academic, behavioral, and social-emotional difficulties</b></p>
<p><b>-Frequent progress monitoring and evaluation of interventions</b></p>
<p>These are good things.  These components are reflected in the current 3GRG language and should be kept and implemented faithfully.  We should be proud in our state to be emphasizing these components.</p>
<p>The whole premise from NASP is that “having students repeat the same grade with the same low quality instruction will yield no improvement for the student”.  So, why would we punish kids for prior poor instruction by retaining them?  <strong>The consequence (retention) is in the wrong place, </strong>as the 3GRG currently stands.  I am proud of the track record over more than a decade in our schools of “un-retaining” students who came to us from districts having been abhorrently retained not once, but in many cases twice, and in a few cases, three times, while getting them the special education and intensive intervention services they actually needed.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, we should keep the strong language in the 3GRG in Ohio requiring early identification and early reading intervention for students who need it.  We should remove the requirement for retention altogether.</strong>  There is no basis in research to support retention as an effective intervention.  At the very least, we should exempt the retention requirement for all students with disabilities or consider retention earlier (ie kindergarten) in extreme circumstances to ensure we aren’t creating far worse problems down the road. The focus moving forward should be on the early identification and delivery of high quality instruction to all students.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indeed,</span></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <b>every child should be able to read by third grade.</b></span>  However, long term, we need to think about a consequence for <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></b> schools for failure to teach kids to read. It should be a consequence that does not punish students for their failure to read by third grade and does not risk their future by retaining them.</p>
<p>I wonder, should all schools be held to the same standard of accountability for closure (as charters) if they continue to churn out kids who can’t read? Something to think about…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every New Year brings with it the hope of new ideas in education, new ways of knowing, a fresh slate of clean, clear ideas for teaching. Every New Year for the past 20 years, I have entered it hoping, almost childlike, for a fresh wave of positive thinking and new ideas in education, chock full of new ways education leaders might collaborate for the betterment of children through school choice of every kind. Yet, today all one has to do is open a newspaper (or check Flipboard or any other array of e-News, blogs, or Twitter feed, like I do every morning) and see a fresh spate of &#8220;eduslamming&#8221; across both sides of the aisle. More often than not, the eduslamming is fraught with misinformation, regardless of where you sit on the issues. Only this morning there is yet another prickly article about charter schools in the Columbus Dispatch. For once, they get it right, rightfully calling for a small number of Sponsors (Authorizers) of charter schools to stop signing up unprepared, inexperienced, or more rarely, but nonetheless sometimes true, scurrilous folks who have no business running schools. (We are particularly proud and fortunate to have excellent sponsors across two states who provide strong support, guidance, and hold our schools accountable in significant and meaningful ways.)</p>
<p>Signing up inexperienced people or unprepared groups with insufficient resources, however well intentioned, is negligent on the part of a small handful of sponsors. This has a dreadful and punitive effect on many other well intentioned, experienced, and thoughtful professional leaders in education, including sponsors, charters, and traditional public schools alike. I argue that all bad press in education is ultimately bad for all educators. It, of course, makes the job extremely difficult for those doing a good job running healthy, high quality schools when schools get bad press, and it makes it devastatingly more difficult when in reaction, legislators potentially bear down on all schools with even more with new regulations, new hammers, and more bureaucracy in response. Good traditional districts and good charters alike cannot operate effectively in a heavily regulated, heavily politicized environment. They simply cannot. The job of properly educating students is too enormous, too complex, and too important to be constantly dealing with political side shows and distractions. While it would be a simple fix to simply stop &#8220;letting the bad charters in&#8221;, on a policy level (and a practical level) it&#8217;s clearly more difficult to address existing failing traditional districts that cannot ever be shut down. Though many courageous school leaders and policy makers are indeed successfully transforming previously failing districts in cities such as Detroit, New Orleans, Washington, DC, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>There are many real casualties when charter schools start and quickly fail. Yet, there are arguably significantly more casualties when huge, behemoth traditional districts consistently churn out students who either don&#8217;t graduate high school, or if they do, come out with few or no skills for college. School failure is most assuredly and most devastatingly harmful to the children who attend both types of failed schools and for the local communities where the schools reside. It is arguably harmful to those seeking to start a charter school who may risk their entire life savings for a well meaning venture yet are permitted to do so with poor guidance, no experience, little support, few resources, and a dearth of legal and financial roadmaps to show them how to make the new school succeed.</p>
<p>I suspect many do not realize that to even start a charter school, they will need significant start up capital and resources to keep the school running in the first three years. Unlike traditional public school leaders, and more like small business entrepreneurs, at any point along the way, new charter operators will likely be required to spend their own resources, mortgage their own home, take out a bridge loan(s), and/or personally guarantee facilities construction. They may be asked to personally finance new construction or renovations for a school building, or, at times when state payments come late, they might be forced to take out a bridge loan to, for example, make the first payroll or subsequent payrolls, pay leases on behalf of the school, and more. That isn’t written anywhere in the fine print when one dreams of developing a charter school. One might be successful at putting his or her vision forward and procuring a charter to open, but one must be careful what one asks for. Schools are not necessarily guaranteed revenues that will come on time, especially in the first year of operations. Developers must have access to capital and strong reserves to carry them through those times, and all too often, the same set of skills required to launch a school aren&#8217;t necessarily the same set of skills necessary to operate it and vice versa.</p>
<p>There are no local tax levies for charters, no earmarked facilities funds, no large cash reserves to rely on when the wheels of government might move slowly or dollars do not flow to schools in the same manner as districts. It is true many grants and private funds are organized well in advanced by &#8220;elite&#8221; charter groups who sometimes have backers with deep pockets. But, for the garden variety charter operator, accessing those funds is often not possible. Yet charters must comply with expensive mandates and the same rules pertaining to special education, service delivery, and many education laws as traditional districts. (Yes, charters must comply, no &#8220;ifs, ands, or buts&#8221;, despite decades of propaganda to the contrary.) Successfully starting a charter school is indeed &#8220;hard&#8221; and not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>More importantly, when a new school quickly crashes and burns a year or two into its launch, this has a negative impact on broader education as a whole, not just on charters, but on all of education. Failure in education of any kind fans the negative public flames and keeps the &#8220;eduslamming&#8221; going. Similarly, when Columbus Public (or any traditional public school district) is embroiled in testing and financial scandals, it helps no one. <strong><strong><em><strong>Though I do find myself wondering if traditional districts were held to the same standard as charter schools, how many of them would close as well?</strong></em></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Somehow, some way, we need to find a way to help all schools succeed.</strong> Period. We surely can&#8217;t do it by expending precious time and resources on &#8220;eduslamming&#8221;, sorting, ranking, blasting, shaming, and hating. <strong>Here are three things we can do now to take the first steps of the New Year to rally schools for success:</strong></p>
<p>1.<strong> Stop &#8220;eduslamming&#8221; now. </strong>Make a commitment to stop fighting. Say it out loud, say it today, say one positive thing about a different kind of school in your community, be it a charter or a traditional public school. Reach out to another principal or teacher in your area and share ways you&#8217;ve been successful! Begin to collaborate outside your comfort zone!<br />
2. <strong>Remind a teacher or colleague he/she is a professional</strong>. Say something today to a teacher to remind him or her they are truly doing the most important job on the planet!<br />
3.<strong> Spread the good news about your school.</strong> If a newspaper won&#8217;t print your good news, share it on social media, blogs, Facebook, Twitter, wherever you can tell your story! Share it today!</p>
<p>When I got into the world of school choice nearly 20 years ago, I truly believed in exactly that—-school choice. <em><strong>What a powerful dream it was to think that every child might be able to access a great school no matter where they lived, no matter what their learning style! </strong></em> It wasn&#8217;t about destroying public education as we know it, and it wasn&#8217;t about sorting, ranking, shaming, and tearing down teachers of any stripe&#8211;charter school teachers or traditional public school teachers. It was about providing more choices for kids and families. When districts fail in their own way (not by closure, but by academic or financial mismanagement), and when charters fail, we aren’t creating great choices for kids. Rather, we are ultimately continuing the arguments. Education continues to be fodder to sell newspapers. How does that help kids? It&#8217;s time to engage students, and it&#8217;s time to engage one another in positive, thoughtful discussions about what works for our students. Let&#8217;s turn the conversation around by creating and sharing the successes of our kids in 2014!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It isn&#8217;t a coincidence that several negative articles about charter schools and school choice have come out this week. Thousands of public school teachers <a title="Union Rally Today for Public Education" href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/1213/morningeducation12434.html">rallied yesterday</a> from New York to San Francisco to “reclaim the promise of public education.” Unions draw over $2 billion in dues from educators annually. Though membership is falling in some teacher unions,(e.g. NEA), they undoubtedly represent a powerful political presence in this country.</p>
<p>But the endless arguing between public school supporters and charter school advocates in this country isn&#8217;t helping our students achieve anything. The latest PISA results demonstrate that. Students in the US were ranked in the middle of the pack compared to other countries on this global test of achievement.</p>
<p>Slamming charter school teachers and school choice isn&#8217;t the answer. Slamming public school teachers and public schools isn&#8217;t the answer. While everyone continues the blame game, no one has agreed how to get there. We all agree on the dependent variable, which is education&#8217;s Holy Grail:<strong> raising academic achievement</strong>. But no one agrees on the independent variable(s): &#8220;<strong>how</strong>&#8220;. Raising standards alone isn&#8217;t enough. Standards are one thing. Good teaching is another.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s attack these three, straightforward, independent variables in education first, before we can actually expect to see meaningful increases in academic outcomes on a global scale:</p>
<p>1) We have to better engage students.<br />
2) We have to deliver high quality instruction.<br />
3) We have to better engage parents so they want to be involved in their child&#8217;s school.</p>
<p>Beating each other up, shaming people into working harder, and beating teachers over the head isn&#8217;t going to get the job done. Teachers and principals of all stripes should take charge of engaging kids, deliver high quality instruction, and build lasting and meaningful relationships with parents to help them want to be engaged in their child&#8217;s school. These three practices must be embraced by public and charter school educators alike.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the one most important thing we can do right now as school leaders and teachers to ensure the success of our reform efforts?</p>
<p><strong>Tell our story.</strong> If I could wave a magic wand, every person involved in school choice, charter schools, and school reform would be telling their success story. In Ohio alone, we are over 400 charter school leader voices and thousands more teacher voices. At over 130,000 charter school students served in this state, there are over a quarter million parents, grandparents, board members, and staff voices yet to be heard. So many are doing all the right things to improve instruction and service delivery in schools&#8211;using data, personalizing instruction, and implementing many instructional strategies that will effectively teach our students the 21st century skills they need to be successful in the marketplace.</p>
<p>But we’ve got to let the world know the GREAT things that are happening in our schools. Share your awesome data in simple, understandable terms that show your students&#8217; learning gains. Share your individual success stories. Share your triumphs. Don’t let hatemongering newspapers, Diane Ravitches, teacher unions and schizophrenic think tanks (who change their policies like fashion designers toss out last season&#8217;s new dress) define you. You’re your own story.</p>
<p>Use social media. Get on Twitter, Facebook, and Linked In. That’s where parents are. That’s where teachers are. That’s where the future is. Tell your story there. If the newpapers won’t print your good news, tell your story some other way. For far too long now we’ve allowed things to be “done to&#8221; and &#8220;about&#8221; charter schools and school choice. Whether it’s attempted death by a thousand cuts from policy makers, or purposeful edupolicy shaping by newspapers and think tanks, we can&#8217;t ignore it.</p>
<p>We need to lead the improvements ourselves and stop allowing other organizations to denigrate our efforts, be they foundations or policy wonks who’ve NEVER taught a single day in their lives, certainly not led a school, nor led a school improvement team for academically at-risk youth. They most certainly have not experienced leveraging their assets, taking unbelievable risks to finance buildings, or exercised the entrepreneurial creativity necessary to successfully open or run a charter school. But theyre going to define us? Certainly not.</p>
<p>So again, if we are to ensure the place for charters into the future, we need to tell our own story. There are many, many people who stand at the ready to kill charter schools and school choice. They revel in negativity. The newspapers still largely publish only bad news because it sells. We need 10 positive stories out there for every bad one. Many well organized teacher unions are again calling for removal of charter schools only this week. They are organized and complaining to legislators that we &#8220;take too many resources from traditional districts&#8221;. We need a common voice. I am sure we have more commonalities within the school choice movement than differences. We need leadership, and we need a plan. The fact is, “making charter schools go away” isn’t going to solve the public school district’s problems, because their problems so often have no consequences. They don’t close, and they can go on in perpetuity and miseducate or undereducate thousands of children. Ours in the ultimate in educational accountability—the possibility of school closure. That’s what we signed up for. That’s what we embrace. But let us tell our story. Let us tell our truths.</p>
<p>One old persisting canard is that we waste taxpayer money. But, when we perform the same or better, than the traditional districts, we save the taxpayers smoney. We don’t take their resources, we are saving money. Charters leverage no local property tax dollars and rely almost exclusively on state and federal funding and funds they manage to raise themselves. Certainly the day that charters receive funding equitably with districts will be a great day for charter school students.</p>
<p>Let’s define ourselves. If for no reason other than our teachers, our staff, your children, they need us to lead. They are in the trenches every day; they are being tested every day. They need our leadership so they can do their job. Let’s define ourselves. Continue to create the data driven teams that drill down to the individual student level, and continue creating a safety net of academic and behavioral supports for those students who need it the most.</p>
<p>Parents are coming to us for higher academic quality, but they come for many other reasons as well-—safety, smaller class sizes, better communication with their child’s school, more individualized attention, a specific niche like the arts, fitness, or technology. Together, we have to help promote and defend a parent’s right to choose the best education for their child. One size most certainly does not fit all. Share your triumphs. Tell your story. Protect a parent&#8217;s right to choose a quality school that meets their child&#8217;s needs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, the Huffington Post posted &#8220;An Open Letter To National School Choice Week&#8221;. In the letter, Steve Nelson barrages School Choice Week officials with wild accusations, including accelerating the &#8220;demise of public education in America&#8221;. He hurls further outrageous insults like the groups that fund School Choice Week &#8220;hope to shrink government to a size where it might be drowned in the bathtub&#8221;, and further posits, &#8220;Do you wish the same for public education?&#8221; He goes on to erroneously charge school choice with &#8220;promoting segregation&#8221;, funneling money to &#8220;fundamentalist religious schools through contrived mechanisms&#8221; and other equally paranoid claims, such as the big kahuna: School choice &#8220;violates the First Amendment&#8221;! Wow. Just wow. Mr. Nelson, I don&#8217;t believe those of us who have supported school choice efforts for nearly twenty years and who have made it our life&#8217;s work actually wake up every morning conceiving and contriving ways to &#8220;violate the First Amendment&#8221;, promote segregation, or &#8220;drown the government&#8221;. In sum, this is just crazy talk.</p>
<p>School Choice embodies the provisions of the First Amendment, free exercise of religion, free speech, and free press (so yes, you can make these false accusations without recourse), and so on. What more fundamental right should a parent and child have than the right to a free quality education of THEIR choice? What more fundamental right is there, I ask you? Whether a parent seeks smaller class sizes, a safe school, a positive learning environment, a unique learning experience tailored to their child&#8217;s learning style, better communication from their child&#8217;s school, or better academics than what their local public school offers, shouldn&#8217;t they be able to choose that for their child? <em><strong> Education is NOT a one size fits all. It simply is not.</strong></em> Can you in your heart deny a parent the right to choose what they think is best for their child? We have parents in our schools, for example who have multiple children, and they may send one to us and one to the local public school and one to a private school to meet their children&#8217;s unique needs. Do we begrudge that family for making the best decision for the child who attends a public school? Absolutely not. We embrace it. We embrace it because, yes, we actually believe in this thing called &#8220;school choice&#8221;. Fundamentally, we should respect parents for knowing their own children better than anyone else.</p>
<p>By the way, I agree with you that schools should be equitably funded. When charter schools are funded at anything close to the same levels as traditional public school districts, it would be a great day indeed for students who attend charter schools. In the meantime, we will continue doing more with far less money per student than the districts receive. We are proud that many charters perform as well or better at less cost per student for taxpayers.</p>
<p>Shame on Huffington Post for posting this letter that is fraught with false claims and sensationalism that further confuses parents, keeps the &#8220;edufighting&#8221; going, and seeks to deny parents the right to choose the best school option for their child. This is just plain bad for kids. The children we serve are ALL our children. School choice is for all&#8211;traditional public, private, homeschool, and charter, because one size does not fit all.</p>
