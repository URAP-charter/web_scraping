				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Public charter schools are often barraged with media inquiries and records requests or may at least experience some type of media coverage at some point during the school year. This can create anxiety for charter school leaders who aren&#8217;t fully prepared to address requests for information from newspaper reporters, television journalists, or other media representatives. Or worse, lack of preparation for positively engaging media may lead to published misinformation about charter schools, lost opportunities to share positive stories about your school, or even perceived (or real) failure to comply timely with public records requests.  Today I spoke on a panel about positively engaging the media at the Ohio Council of Community Schools&#8217; Leadership Conference, titled, &#8220;Next Generation of Accountability&#8221; for charter school leaders in Toledo, Ohio. I shared some useful tips with other charter leaders on how to respond to and proactively engage with the media as part of that panel. Below are several &#8220;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8221; for charter schools I shared today that, over the years, I&#8217;ve found helpful in positively engaging calls and requests from the media:</p>
<p><strong>DO</strong></p>
<p>Have a specific point person to handle all media contacts<br />
Respond promptly to public records requests; know what is considered a public record in your state<br />
Know and understand your school’s data and be ready to speak to it accurately<br />
Stick to the facts<br />
Have talking points; stick to them<br />
Consider responding in writing as opposed to verbally, if able<br />
Work closely with other charter schools to have a common voice<br />
Work together with other charter leaders on a positive PR campaign<br />
Write and distribute meaningful, well written press releases to appropriate media outlets<br />
Organize and communicate with positive, energetic parents, grassroots organizations, and legislators about great things happening in your school<br />
Be mindful of peak legislative periods, and be prepared to answer media calls<br />
Use social media as a powerful tool for positive PR<br />
Have solid social media policies and communicate them to staff<br />
Take a few hours before you respond to media inquiries if you aren’t fully prepared<br />
Respond politely and professionally</p>
<p><strong>DON&#8217;T</strong></p>
<p>Allow others to define you<br />
Get off balance<br />
Stray from the facts<br />
Answer immediately if you aren&#8217;t prepared<br />
Talk too much<br />
Be defensive<br />
Disparage other schools or districts; keep your answer positively focused on your school&#8217;s<br />
accomplishments based on facts<br />
Invite reporters or photographers to your school without a plan<br />
Shy away from social media as a potentially powerful tool to tell your own story in your own words<br />
Fail to train staff on your social media, records requests, and other PR policies</p>
