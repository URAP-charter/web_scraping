				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is fitting that <em>National Charter Schools Week a</em>nd <em>Teacher Appreciation Week</em> fall during the same week this year. President Obama declared this week <strong>National Charter Schools Week, May 4-10, 2014</strong>.  Parents, students, and community members owe a great deal to successful charter schools, charter school pioneers, and charter school teachers. Arguably, the most important reason to celebrate charter schools is they offer educational choice to families otherwise restricted to a failing school because of their zip code.  Fortunately, because of early charter school pioneers and supporters, there are now over 2.5 million students enrolled in more than 6,000 charter schools nationally (<em>Source: National Association of Public Charter Schools, www.public charters.org</em>). One in twenty students now attends a public charter school. More reasons to support and celebrate charter schools this week and always are below:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Charter schools empower parents and students.</strong> Children should not be limited to a failing school because of their zip code.  Where a child lives should not determine whether a child receives a quality education.  Charters offer parents educational choice and educational mobility. Charters empower families.</p>
<p>2) <strong>One size does not fit all; different kids <span style="text-decoration: underline;">need</span> different schools.</strong>  Many traditional public schools do a decent job of educating most of their kids.  But many schools don&#8217;t, and even in high performing school districts, there are children who suffer academically, socially, emotionally, through bullying, or for other reasons. Charter schools provide a unique programmatic opportunity for students who were otherwise not always successful in their previous school and for parents who were dissatisfied in their child&#8217;s previous school. After all, if parents were satisfied with their previous school, they wouldn&#8217;t enroll their child in a charter school.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Achievement outcomes are higher in many charter schools.</strong> School choice improves student achievement. Countries like Finland, Belgium, and Australia, where parents actively choose their schools have better schools. (See &#8220;Education Myths&#8221;, Jay P. Greene).</p>
<p>4) <strong>Charter schools often provide smaller class sizes, and equally important, smaller school sizes.  </strong>Parents care about strong academics, but they care about other important factors as well.  These include safety, opportunities to be involved in their child&#8217;s education, frequent communication between home and school, and more. What smaller class sizes and smaller school sizes mean to parents are often more opportunities for parent involvement, better home and school communication, and more opportunities to focus on other facets arguably as important as academic achievement. Such factors may include character education, anti-bullying programs, school safety, niche programs (such as music, art, fitness, or technology), greater access to teachers and administrators, and stronger school/family relationships.  Moreover, parents report real and tangible benefits related to the fact that nearly everyone in the building may know their particular child, including the school administrators, support staff, and classroom teachers.</p>
<p>5) <strong>Charter schools are a bargain to the American taxpayer; charter schools do much more with less money</strong>.  Charter schools efficiently deliver quality education to students with fewer resources. In 2011, charters received $3059 less per student than traditional public schools (in urban districts, that figure is much higher), and that disparity has grown by 55% since 2007.  All states, except for Tennessee, gave more money to traditional public schools than charter schools (See: University of Arkansas Dep. of Ed Reform study). Charter schools are more economical to the taxpayer, and they are more efficient.  Most charters are unable to access local tax levy revenue like the local districts, and most receive significantly fewer dollars per pupil to educate students. Most importantly, children were never meant to receive an education through the churning of huge district wheels designed to crank out thousands of kids.  The necessary and associated burdens of huge administrative overhead costs take away from classrooms. Children are not widgets. The layers and layers of bureaucracy, policies, and systems designed to meet the needs of thousands of kids in a district or a building for a thousand students make no sense.</p>
<p>6) <strong>Charter schools are bound by the ultimate accountability consequence&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">closure</span> for poor academic outcomes tied to a limited period of time.</strong> Many behemoth, failing, traditional public school districts continue to produce high drop out rates, students who can&#8217;t read by the third grade, and poor overall academic results for kids.  Many of these schools are not safe from bullying or threats. How long should that be permitted to continue?  Should traditional districts be given two years to get it together before they close like many charters schools? Should they be given 5 years, 10 years?  What is our tolerance for public schools with no consequence for academic failure? Many have had poor outcomes for decades with no real consequence that sticks.  Charter schools are held to the highest level of accountability for poor academic outcomes. They actually have their funding taken away, and they actually close for poor performance.  More importantly, we are seeing &#8220;loft&#8221; in the charter community over time as quality charter schools continue to rise and provide more quality options for parents and students.</p>
<p>National Charter Schools Week 2014 is indeed a great time to recognize the power and opportunities inherent in charter schools for parents and students. With one million students on charter school waiting lists nationwide, it is clear parents desire educational choice.  <strong>Celebrate your charter school and your charter school teachers today!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the battle rages to close the &#8220;learning gap&#8221; for many students, it&#8217;s not enough to be smart.  I&#8217;ve said it before, there are plenty of smart, mean people in the world, and not enough smart, nice people. It&#8217;s time to have a sense of urgency about<em><strong> &#8220;closing the character gap&#8221;. </strong> </em></p>
<p>Here are five things you can do now to teach character and prosocial behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MAKE A COMMITMENT; HAVE A PLAN</strong></li>
<li><strong>HAVE STUDENTS START A WEEKLY CHARACTER JOURNAL</strong></li>
<li><strong>USE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO SEEK IDEAS</strong></li>
<li><strong>MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH YOUR STUDENTS</strong></li>
<li><strong>REWARD, CELEBRATE, AND REINFORCE STUDENTS&#8217; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I. MAKE A COMMITMENT; HAVE A PLAN</p>
<p>In order to teach character effectively, you just need to start! Make the commitment to start each day with a character lesson.  Start with just one character trait you want to teach.  Include it in your lesson plan.  Allocate a block of time each morning.  If it&#8217;s not in writing, it might not happen.</p>
<p>II. HAVE STUDENTS START A WEEKLY CHARACTER JOURNAL</p>
<p>Start each week with a weekly character quote by a famous person of high character.  Have your students expand on that by writing each day in their journal what the quote means to them.  Assign activities related to the quote.</p>
<p>III. USE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO FIND IDEAS</p>
<p>Start every morning with developmentally appropriate (and fun!) character education activities.  Search Pinterest, Teachers Helping Teachers, and other sites for grade level character lessons aligned to the Common Core.</p>
<p>IV. MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH YOUR STUDENTS</p>
<p>Share something about yourself.  Talk to them about your experiences.  Meet them at their level, and by revealing something personal about yourself (appropriately), you show them you are human and you care. Sharing how you overcame a personal obstacle makes you &#8220;real&#8221;.</p>
<p>V. REWARD, CELEBRATE, AND REINFORCE STUDENTS&#8217; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS</p>
<p>When your kids overcome a learning block, when you observe them sharing, when you see them solve a problem or show respect, PRAISE them!  Have character bulletin boards, celebrate &#8220;citizen of the month&#8221;, and character walls on display in your school building.  Create a<em><strong> &#8220;culture of character&#8221;</strong></em> in your school.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Even though schools are laser focused on amping up for the Common Core, are we forgetting something?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The Common Core debates are heating up.  The push for more and better professional development on the Common Core State Standards for teachers and administrators forges full speed ahead.  Charters and traditional public school districts alike are bearing down on teachers to learn everything they can about the CCSS as schools attempt to align their curricula, adjust their instructional strategies, and become poised to successfully compete on brand new high stakes tests that have yet to been seen.</p>
<p>All that, and charters and districts will soon line up to be ranked by new state report cards in many states which will sort them A-F on a variety of standards based in large part on the outcomes of these largely unseen high stakes tests.  (Charters will bear the ultimate accountability responsibility-risk of closure for failing to measure up).  Meantime, policy analysts and educators are debating about whether American students lag behind in academics as much as some purport, and if those achievement gaps stem from poverty or in fact from poor teaching  (see <a title="Finn &amp; Petrilli: 6 Reasons Why Conservatives Should Back Common Core" href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130922/OPINION05/309220104" target="_blank">Petrilli</a> and <a title="Why I Oppose Common Core Standards" href="http://m.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/02/26/why-i-oppose-common-core-standards-ravitch/" target="_blank">Ravitch</a> and <a title="Common Core is not What Its Supporters Claim it Is" href="http://www.unionleader.com/article/20130725/OPINION02/130729573/1009/OPINION01" target="_blank">McCluskey</a>).  Big thinkers are wondering whether we&#8217;ve even identified the correct dependent and independent variables in myriad of research (achievement as a dependent variable and poverty, for example and a host of others, as independent variables-see <a title="A Chance for a New Fordham" href="http://jaypgreene.com/2013/11/04/a-chance-for-a-new-fordham" target="_blank">Jay Greene</a>).  Meantime still, parents of the very children we all seek to serve, as well as the teachers in the trenches, are trying to make sense of it all. Oh, and yes, technology&#8211;remember, in the midst of this education revolution (which is what it is, don&#8217;t think otherwise), you ought to be flipping your classroom!  While the latter may be an exaggeration, it&#8217;s not entirely a stretch.  There is an overall expectation that districts should be offering students at least some meaningful blended learning experiences along the spectrum of instructional tools aligned with the Common Core, and most &#8220;good districts&#8221; and &#8220;good charters&#8221; are complying.</p>
<p>The Common Core arguably has many commendable things in it, though the devil is always in the details of implementation.  The quest to increase academic achievement is a noble pursuit.  As part of the school choice and reform movement for 15 years, there are many aspects of reform I embrace.   Yet no one I know is excited about how CCSS was rolled out and how schools were asked to support it without empirical data.  Many complain there wasn&#8217;t full disclosure of where it came from.  Regardless, no one can definitively say whether or not the implementation of these standards (the independent variable) will have a positive effect on education&#8217;s Holy Grail&#8211;the dependent variable, which is increasing academic achievement. (Of course, neither did NCLB).  Obviously, in my organization, we&#8217;ve committed over a million dollars to Common Core aligned curriculum and teacher training in the grandest of hopes that it will.  Yet the fact remains, the standards themselves are untested.</p>
<p>But I want to refocus the conversation on something we as educators have known for centuries.  <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>While the war on closing the achievement gap rages, what about Character Education?</strong></span></em>  While it ought to be a requisite goal for schools to turn out smart kids,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong> it’s not enough to be smart</strong></em></span>. There are arguably plenty of smart, mean people in the world, and not enough smart, nice people.  Moreover, there is plenty of empirical research that demonstrates success in college and success in the workplace are largely dependent on social skills, compassion, character, the ability to get along with people, not to mention overall &#8220;grit&#8221;.</p>
<p>It struck me during a talk by a leading expert on school violence last year in Boston that <em><strong>we need to spend way more time on character development</strong></em>.  These are indeed skills that can be and must be taught. We know that bullying is pervasive in schools, and we know that school violence is only on the rise. We also know that perpetrators of school violence were more frequently bullied in school than their peers.  We know that future perpetrators of school violence may be victims of repetitive bullying right now.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t we owe it to our children and to their future to teach them empathy, kindness, forgiveness, courage and respect?  Can&#8217;t we meet them at their humanity and bridge cultural and socioeconomic differences and create communities based on our commonalities as human beings?  What could be more important than molding and shaping future citizens of tomorrow?  I submit that at this time and in this place, nothing is more urgent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my first weekly blog post. These weekly posts will focus on timely issues in education practice, policy and trends. Topics will include school choice, charter schools, school reform and special education, but also general education for the larger good.  I am committed to writing in the spirit of seeking facts, and sharing useful, relevant knowledge and opinions for educators and policy makers.  Most importantly, I intend to write in the spirit of being part of the solutions in education, not adding to the already intensely divisive, and often self-aggrandizing, rhetoric that makes the challenging job of teaching even harder in our daily lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that spirit, I thought it important to make my first blog arguably about the single most important thing we as educators ought to be doing in our schools&#8211;<b><i>teaching character education</i></b>. A <a title="Tennessee schools report 7,555 cases of bullying in 2012" href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2013/oct/24/tennessee-schools-report-7555-cases-bullying-2012/?breakingnews" target="_blank">new study in Tennessee</a> released over the weekend reminds us the problem of bullying is pervasive in schools.  In the study, over 7,500 cases of bullying were reported in 2012.  Sadly, 73% of those cases were reportedly confirmed, meaning nearly 5,500 students in the state of Tennessee experienced bullying of some kind in 2012.  Some general trends included 9.2% of the cases being gender-based, and 2.2% of the cases involved students with disabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, our leadership team received training while at Harvard from a leading expert in school violence.  What stood out for me at that training was the fact that perpetrators of school violence are often victims of consistent bullying in school themselves. They were often described by peers as “that student most likely to be bullied.” While that’s not to say that every child who is bullied becomes a participant in school violence, in reflecting on the Tennessee study, I wondered how many future perpetrators of school violence may be among those 5,500 students who experienced bullying themselves.…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to look the problem of bullying straight in the eye.  The extent to which bullying inflicts emotional harm on its victims, particularly students with disabilities, and the extent to which bullying adversely impacts classroom learning is unacceptable.  <b><i>While there is a war on closing the achievement gap in this country, there also ought to be a similar level of effort expended on combating bullying and preventing bullying through daily character education.</i></b>  For our part at Performance Academies, we’ve developed a character education program with weekly lessons, and teachers are required to start every day with a 40-minute lesson. This is monitored through the professional learning community (PLC) minutes and rigorous reviews of lesson plans and observations and walk through evaluations.  While indeed this impacts the daily schedule, there is nothing more important to us than turning out good future citizens.   While it ought to be a requisite goal for schools to turn out smart kids, it’s not enough to be smart. There are arguably plenty of smart, mean people in the world, and not enough smart, nice people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing with you future thoughts, research and opinions about the latest trends in education, and the happenings and achievements in our schools. Any rants, opinions, or tirades written in the blog are purely my own. I started the blog to share educational trends with our staff and the broader community, and I hope that other educators and policy makers will find useful material and insights to make their jobs a little easier (and also get them thinking a little bit…).</p>
