				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It isn&#8217;t a coincidence that several negative articles about charter schools and school choice have come out this week. Thousands of public school teachers <a title="Union Rally Today for Public Education" href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/1213/morningeducation12434.html">rallied yesterday</a> from New York to San Francisco to “reclaim the promise of public education.” Unions draw over $2 billion in dues from educators annually. Though membership is falling in some teacher unions,(e.g. NEA), they undoubtedly represent a powerful political presence in this country.</p>
<p>But the endless arguing between public school supporters and charter school advocates in this country isn&#8217;t helping our students achieve anything. The latest PISA results demonstrate that. Students in the US were ranked in the middle of the pack compared to other countries on this global test of achievement.</p>
<p>Slamming charter school teachers and school choice isn&#8217;t the answer. Slamming public school teachers and public schools isn&#8217;t the answer. While everyone continues the blame game, no one has agreed how to get there. We all agree on the dependent variable, which is education&#8217;s Holy Grail:<strong> raising academic achievement</strong>. But no one agrees on the independent variable(s): &#8220;<strong>how</strong>&#8220;. Raising standards alone isn&#8217;t enough. Standards are one thing. Good teaching is another.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s attack these three, straightforward, independent variables in education first, before we can actually expect to see meaningful increases in academic outcomes on a global scale:</p>
<p>1) We have to better engage students.<br />
2) We have to deliver high quality instruction.<br />
3) We have to better engage parents so they want to be involved in their child&#8217;s school.</p>
<p>Beating each other up, shaming people into working harder, and beating teachers over the head isn&#8217;t going to get the job done. Teachers and principals of all stripes should take charge of engaging kids, deliver high quality instruction, and build lasting and meaningful relationships with parents to help them want to be engaged in their child&#8217;s school. These three practices must be embraced by public and charter school educators alike.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the one most important thing we can do right now as school leaders and teachers to ensure the success of our reform efforts?</p>
<p><strong>Tell our story.</strong> If I could wave a magic wand, every person involved in school choice, charter schools, and school reform would be telling their success story. In Ohio alone, we are over 400 charter school leader voices and thousands more teacher voices. At over 130,000 charter school students served in this state, there are over a quarter million parents, grandparents, board members, and staff voices yet to be heard. So many are doing all the right things to improve instruction and service delivery in schools&#8211;using data, personalizing instruction, and implementing many instructional strategies that will effectively teach our students the 21st century skills they need to be successful in the marketplace.</p>
<p>But we’ve got to let the world know the GREAT things that are happening in our schools. Share your awesome data in simple, understandable terms that show your students&#8217; learning gains. Share your individual success stories. Share your triumphs. Don’t let hatemongering newspapers, Diane Ravitches, teacher unions and schizophrenic think tanks (who change their policies like fashion designers toss out last season&#8217;s new dress) define you. You’re your own story.</p>
<p>Use social media. Get on Twitter, Facebook, and Linked In. That’s where parents are. That’s where teachers are. That’s where the future is. Tell your story there. If the newpapers won’t print your good news, tell your story some other way. For far too long now we’ve allowed things to be “done to&#8221; and &#8220;about&#8221; charter schools and school choice. Whether it’s attempted death by a thousand cuts from policy makers, or purposeful edupolicy shaping by newspapers and think tanks, we can&#8217;t ignore it.</p>
<p>We need to lead the improvements ourselves and stop allowing other organizations to denigrate our efforts, be they foundations or policy wonks who’ve NEVER taught a single day in their lives, certainly not led a school, nor led a school improvement team for academically at-risk youth. They most certainly have not experienced leveraging their assets, taking unbelievable risks to finance buildings, or exercised the entrepreneurial creativity necessary to successfully open or run a charter school. But theyre going to define us? Certainly not.</p>
<p>So again, if we are to ensure the place for charters into the future, we need to tell our own story. There are many, many people who stand at the ready to kill charter schools and school choice. They revel in negativity. The newspapers still largely publish only bad news because it sells. We need 10 positive stories out there for every bad one. Many well organized teacher unions are again calling for removal of charter schools only this week. They are organized and complaining to legislators that we &#8220;take too many resources from traditional districts&#8221;. We need a common voice. I am sure we have more commonalities within the school choice movement than differences. We need leadership, and we need a plan. The fact is, “making charter schools go away” isn’t going to solve the public school district’s problems, because their problems so often have no consequences. They don’t close, and they can go on in perpetuity and miseducate or undereducate thousands of children. Ours in the ultimate in educational accountability—the possibility of school closure. That’s what we signed up for. That’s what we embrace. But let us tell our story. Let us tell our truths.</p>
<p>One old persisting canard is that we waste taxpayer money. But, when we perform the same or better, than the traditional districts, we save the taxpayers smoney. We don’t take their resources, we are saving money. Charters leverage no local property tax dollars and rely almost exclusively on state and federal funding and funds they manage to raise themselves. Certainly the day that charters receive funding equitably with districts will be a great day for charter school students.</p>
<p>Let’s define ourselves. If for no reason other than our teachers, our staff, your children, they need us to lead. They are in the trenches every day; they are being tested every day. They need our leadership so they can do their job. Let’s define ourselves. Continue to create the data driven teams that drill down to the individual student level, and continue creating a safety net of academic and behavioral supports for those students who need it the most.</p>
<p>Parents are coming to us for higher academic quality, but they come for many other reasons as well-—safety, smaller class sizes, better communication with their child’s school, more individualized attention, a specific niche like the arts, fitness, or technology. Together, we have to help promote and defend a parent’s right to choose the best education for their child. One size most certainly does not fit all. Share your triumphs. Tell your story. Protect a parent&#8217;s right to choose a quality school that meets their child&#8217;s needs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, the Huffington Post posted &#8220;An Open Letter To National School Choice Week&#8221;. In the letter, Steve Nelson barrages School Choice Week officials with wild accusations, including accelerating the &#8220;demise of public education in America&#8221;. He hurls further outrageous insults like the groups that fund School Choice Week &#8220;hope to shrink government to a size where it might be drowned in the bathtub&#8221;, and further posits, &#8220;Do you wish the same for public education?&#8221; He goes on to erroneously charge school choice with &#8220;promoting segregation&#8221;, funneling money to &#8220;fundamentalist religious schools through contrived mechanisms&#8221; and other equally paranoid claims, such as the big kahuna: School choice &#8220;violates the First Amendment&#8221;! Wow. Just wow. Mr. Nelson, I don&#8217;t believe those of us who have supported school choice efforts for nearly twenty years and who have made it our life&#8217;s work actually wake up every morning conceiving and contriving ways to &#8220;violate the First Amendment&#8221;, promote segregation, or &#8220;drown the government&#8221;. In sum, this is just crazy talk.</p>
<p>School Choice embodies the provisions of the First Amendment, free exercise of religion, free speech, and free press (so yes, you can make these false accusations without recourse), and so on. What more fundamental right should a parent and child have than the right to a free quality education of THEIR choice? What more fundamental right is there, I ask you? Whether a parent seeks smaller class sizes, a safe school, a positive learning environment, a unique learning experience tailored to their child&#8217;s learning style, better communication from their child&#8217;s school, or better academics than what their local public school offers, shouldn&#8217;t they be able to choose that for their child? <em><strong> Education is NOT a one size fits all. It simply is not.</strong></em> Can you in your heart deny a parent the right to choose what they think is best for their child? We have parents in our schools, for example who have multiple children, and they may send one to us and one to the local public school and one to a private school to meet their children&#8217;s unique needs. Do we begrudge that family for making the best decision for the child who attends a public school? Absolutely not. We embrace it. We embrace it because, yes, we actually believe in this thing called &#8220;school choice&#8221;. Fundamentally, we should respect parents for knowing their own children better than anyone else.</p>
<p>By the way, I agree with you that schools should be equitably funded. When charter schools are funded at anything close to the same levels as traditional public school districts, it would be a great day indeed for students who attend charter schools. In the meantime, we will continue doing more with far less money per student than the districts receive. We are proud that many charters perform as well or better at less cost per student for taxpayers.</p>
<p>Shame on Huffington Post for posting this letter that is fraught with false claims and sensationalism that further confuses parents, keeps the &#8220;edufighting&#8221; going, and seeks to deny parents the right to choose the best school option for their child. This is just plain bad for kids. The children we serve are ALL our children. School choice is for all&#8211;traditional public, private, homeschool, and charter, because one size does not fit all.</p>
