<p><strong><em>The Spring Musical is in rehearsals! </em></strong></p>
<p>The show is April 20th-April 24th.  The musical is &#8220;In the Heights&#8221;.  This amazing musical was the first musical written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the famous author of the musical, &#8220;Hamilton&#8221;.  <em>I</em><em>n the Heights</em> centers on a variety of characters living in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, on the northern tip of Manhattan. At the center of the show is Usnavi, a bodega owner who looks after the aging Cuban lady next door, pines for the gorgeous girl working in the neighboring beauty salon and dreams of winning the lottery and escaping to the shores of his native Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, Nina, a childhood friend of Usnavi’s, has returned to the neighborhood from her first year at college with surprising news for her parents, who have spent their life savings on building a better life for their daughter.

                        <p><strong> </strong>Ridgeview Junior High School believes that learning happens both inside and outside of the classroom. We believe in providing students with authentic learning opportunities that provide real world connections. By participating in activities in the Columbus and Pickerington communities, we align with our STEM focus of service learning. By learning through service, the students will make connections through multiple disciplines and engage in innovative thinking and problem solving. We believe that service learning also promotes and builds positive relationships between our school and the community.</p>
<p>On May 22nd, Ridgeview students and staff will go out into the community and serve in a variety of ways by collecting food for the Food Pantry, cleaning up debris in the parks, painting and sprucing up area businesses, washing police and fire vehicles, packaging meals for Haiti, sorting clothing donations, and much more.  We are excited to be able to provide our students with this opportunity for service and growth.</p>
<p>All students and adult volunteers will have the opportunity to purchase a T-shirt to wear on Service Learning Day.   They are only $5 and will help make our work crews highly visible within the community.  If you would like to purchase one or more shirts, please download the <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/ridgeview-stem-junior-high/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2017/03/MakeADifferenceShirt2017.pdf">T-SHIRT ORDER FORM</a> or pick one up on the office.  You also have the opportunity to make a donation of a shirt for a student who may not be able to purchase one due to financial constraints, as well as making a donation, if you choose to do so, toward the expense of a meal packaging for Haiti.</p>
<p>Watch for more information coming soon about SERVICE LEARNING DAY.  Thank you in advance.</p>

                        <p>Ohio is facing a major opioid overdose crisis. And as many Ohio families fight opioid abuse, the impact cascades into the learning environments in Ohio schools. This year, several Ohio science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) schools will complete design challenges aimed at understanding and eliminating Ohio’s opioid crisis. A design challenge is a multi-week project in which students learn by creating new solutions to real-world problems. Design challenges offer an approach to problem-based learning that can go deep into content areas while offering students a wide range of questions to consider. Ridgeview will be kicking off this design challenge in the next couple weeks. Students will work in teams to come up with their solutions to the national problem. They will first work within their teams and then compete with other teams to determine design challenge winners in the spring.</p>

                        <p>Dear Ridgeview families,</p>
<p>Welcome Back and Happy New Year! I hope everyone had a wonderful break! As we start the New Year, I wanted to take this time to remind all Ridgeview families of a couple of things during the winter season. As the weather turns for the worst, we can expect school delays and/or closures. As always, the district will contact TV and radio stations to inform them of any cancellations or delays. The district will also use social media and Infinite Campus Messenger to get this information out. Please make sure that your contact information is up to date on Infinite Campus so you can receive these and all important messages. For more information about delays, closures and/or blizzard bags, please visit Pickerington Local School District’s webpage at <a href="../../snow-calamity-days/index.html">http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/snow-calamity-days/</a>.</p>
<p>Ridgeview Junior High School is open at 6:45 am for students who get dropped off early. Students need to enter through the cafeteria doors by the Welcome Center. Students who arrive early will sit in the cafeteria until dismissed to classes at 7am. If you want to beat the traffic jam, I suggest dropping your student off before 7am. The worst of the traffic is around 7:05 – 7:15 am. <strong><em>Thank you</em></strong> to those who continually follow the drop off procedures and wait in line. This truly makes a difference in keeping our staff and students safe. Please do not cut through the parking lot. There are a lot of staff members and students walking across the parking lot in the morning. With the weather getting worse and no daylight till later in the morning, I want to make sure everyone is safe. Again thank you to those who continue to help in this process. J</p>
<p>The new hallway traffic flow pattern has been working better than expected. We know some students do not like walking a little farther to class; however, the flow of the hallways has helped with the congestion. We all feel that the hallways are safer because of this. Please encourage your student to follow the hallway patterns. In addition, please remind them to get to their class as quickly as they can. We have allowed those who have to travel farther a couple of extra minutes to get to class. No student should be more than couple of minutes late to class. This includes lunch.</p>
<p>Interims will be posted by 4pm on Friday afternoon, January 5th. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the teacher. The second trimester ends on February 17<sup>th</sup>, so there are six more weeks for grades to be improved or maintained.</p>
<p>Finally, I wanted to take this time to thank you for all of your support and for sharing your student with us this school year. I hope everyone has a great 2017!</p>
<p>Eric Koch, Principal</p>

                        <p>Junior High and Middle School Families are invited to the College and Career Family Night on Wednesday, January 25. This year the event will be held at Lakeview Junior High.  The free event will begin with pizza at 5:00 with presentations running from 6:00 to 8:00.</p>
<p>The sessions are designed to help build the foundation for families to start seriously thinking about their children&#8217;s college and careers. Some sessions will include college prep classes, financial planning, developing a six year plan, preparing for college entrance exams, success skills for college and career, the college selection process as well as making the most of the high school experience. Student panels will lead discussions about high school and junior high.</p>
<p>Students and teachers from STEM pathways, Project Lead the Way courses and the Career Center will also be available for demonstrations and to answer questions about their programs during the dinner hour from 5:00 to 6:00.</p>
<p>Attendees will be able to customize what sessions they will attend after the keynote at 6:00.  Students can attend the sessions with their families or they can attend student specific sessions while parents attend sessions more specific for them.</p>
<p>The event is free but registration is requested to make sure we have enough pizza and we can plan our sessions.  To register you can go to the district website and click on the link or click the link below to register.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Before the end of this year, parents should replace the current “bus tracker” mobile application with Petermann Transportation’s new and improved version.</em></strong></p>
<p>Petermann Transportation has updated its mobile app, which parents can use to track their children’s buses. The new version can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.petermannbus.com/Pages/PetermannBusTracker.aspx">http://www.petermannbus.com/Pages/PetermannBusTracker.aspx</a> Parents will need their children’s student ID numbers to set up the app. The new app improves functionality from the old version, including giving Petermann Transportation the ability to communicate directly with parents about bus delays and other issues. Parents are reminded that they should not use the system to wait until the very last minute to send their children to the bus stop. Students must be at their designated stop by the scheduled bus arrival time, and waiting until the last minute can de dangerous if children are running to meet their bus. Plus, the system operates by tracking the GPS units in each bus, so it operates on a lag that can be up to two minutes. During that time, the bus may have made progress on its route, so GPS locations are only approximate.</p>

                        <p>We live in a world surrounded by technology. And we know that whatever field our students choose to go into as adults, their ability to succeed will increasingly depend on understanding how technology works.</p>
<p>But only a tiny fraction of us are learning <strong>how</strong> technology works. Fewer than half of all schools teach computer science.</p>
<p>That’s why our entire school for the 4<sup>th</sup> year is joining in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code, during Computer Science Education Week (December 5-11). More than 100 million students worldwide have already tried an Hour of Code.</p>
<p>Our Hour of Code on December 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> is making a statement that Ridgeview STEM Jr. High is ready to teach these foundational 21st century skills. Again this year Mr. Pete Gordon, software engineer, with a group of additional computer programmers will host the event. To continue bringing programming activities to your students, we want to make our Hour of Code event huge. I encourage you to volunteer, reach out to local media, and share the news on social media channels.</p>
<p>This is a chance to change the future of education Pickerington.</p>

<p><strong>     <u>Ways to Reduce Holiday Stress and Relax this season!</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Put Stress in its Place:</strong> Find peace and joy in any season. Focus on the present moment.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Create the Holiday you want:</strong> Make clear decisions about how you want to spend your time and resources. Consider what is most important to you. What memories will you look back on when the season winds down?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Involve your Children:</strong> Continue with your child’s regular meal and bedtime schedule. Children feel more secure when their day follows a normal routine. You can offset holiday chaos by involving your children in holiday planning. Having a say in the planning can help your child feel more in control during busy times.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Beware of Shopping Pitfalls:</strong> People who focus on gifts generally feel less holiday cheer than those who spend more time with close friends and family. Think about what your loved one truly enjoys. Perhaps lunch out together would be appreciated more than a scarf.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Get Creative in Your Gift Giving:</strong> You don’t have to go into debt to make the holidays special. Have a family meeting and get creative! Drawing names to buy for one person, making homemade gifts or giving a coupon to do the dishes, take the trash out, or take care of pet are ways to save money when gift giving.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Play Games:</strong> Games can keep things fun and light and a good way to connect with others. Games can be played indoors or out and can be anything from a walk, treasure hunt, board game or cards.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Postpone Family Feuds:</strong> When you have a group of people in a small area and everyone expecting to have a great time it could be a set up for arguments. With so much emotion and expectation, the holidays are not the best time to work things out. If old family baggage surfaces, plan to talk after the festivities wind down. It&#8217;s better to address emotional issues in a more relaxed, private setting.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Have Compassion for Yourself and Others:</strong> Try not to take things personally. Most people are just trying to get their needs met. Try not to think about how people &#8220;should be.&#8221; Accept people as they are and where they are coming from. This will show compassion and lessen your frustration.</li>
</ol>

                        <p>Our partners at the <strong>Pickerington PCMA Food Pantry will</strong> kick off their annual major fundraising campaign, &#8220;The Festival of Lights,&#8221; starting Nov. 15. In 2016, the pantry provided more than 166,623 meals to its clients, all of whom live within Pickerington Local School District.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s theme is &#8220;One Light, One Hope.&#8221; It is the ninth year the pantry has held the fundraiser. Each holiday lighting bulb that will be used to decorate the pantry&#8217;s facility at 70 Cross St. in Olde Pickerington Village represents one $5 gift.</p>
<p>The Festival of Lights will run from Nov. 15 through Jan. 15. It also serves as a fundraiser to help the pantry &#8220;keep the lights on&#8221; and to purchase food staples that are unable to be donated.</p>
<p>Monetary donations are always appreciated and can be made in a variety of manners including:</p>
<p>* By mailing a check to the: PCMA Food Pantry, P.O. Box 914, Pickerington, Ohio, 43147.</p>
<p>* By using the PayPal service and visiting the pantry website: <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpcmafoodpantry.com%2F&amp;h=dAQERWxMFAQFpkHIhMo8ovu34WvaoJ8Ov-FfUCLDuaeoM0Q&amp;enc=AZNQxBGWiI_CauGkaR1zPhnkWh-OUYqvVQlerhXXLipT591hujkAjD2PGe3Khdgsekrda8ldBzO0PK4tRdgCvpK0GIYrl0ynWxG50PESsl-T3P52v_VyhN66sGEJa5_1pIQMhfZvayxksPUnszgb1Z-NPFJXhOTfedloKhum7JWPakAXYUS0dskZhe0LRXZnL4-Ts7NQ1NtwjERNUKQx2IQ5&amp;s=1">pcmafoodpantry.com</a>;</p>

                        <p>It is hard to believe that we have nearly completed our first trimester of school, Fall is already here and soon the trees will be bare and the cold weather will be upon us. With the onset of cold weather often comes illness and increased absences from school. I would like to take this opportunity to remind parents of the attendance guidelines set forth by the Pickerington School District and the policies specific to Ridgeview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attendance to school is very important to your child’s academic success. We ask that you help support this standard by encouraging good attendance and making it a priority. Whenever possible, it is preferable that routine appointments are scheduled after school or on days when there is no school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that emergencies and illnesses do occur. In the interest of keeping everyone as healthy as possible, it is advisable that students are kept home when they are ill and not return to school until fever free, without the aid of fever reducing medication, for <strong>24 hours</strong>.</p>
<p>In the event that your child is unable to attend school, please notify the school by 8:00 AM. You may call the office, or the Attendance Hotline, (614)- 548-1701, which is available 24 hours, and leave a message. It is always helpful to provide a <strong>medical excuse</strong> if your child is seen by a physician or medical practitioner. Absences not authorized by a parent will be considered <em>unexcused</em>.</p>
<p>Excessive absences may result in discipline and/or intervention by the District Attendance Officer. Please refer to the PLSD website for a complete explanation of the attendance policies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Be on time!</em> Our tardy bell rings at 7:20 AM. Students who are tardy to school or first period class an excessive number of times within the same marking period may be issued an after school two-hour QST (Quiet Study Time) or other appropriate disciplinary consequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We seek to work with you to ensure your child’s success. If there are extenuating circumstances that contribute to your child’s absences, please feel free to call me to discuss them at any time. Thank you for your support in this matter.</p>

                        <p><strong><u>SEEKING CAREER PROFESSIONALS FOR “CAREER CAFÉ”</u></strong></p>
<p>Ridgeview STEM Junior High School is looking for some local professionals willing to volunteer to serve as role models and resources for students during its Career Café program.</p>
<p>The professionals will talk and give brief presentations to participating Ridgeview students during lunch periods at the school. Teacher Tabitha Furlong said the career professionals would only be asked to commit to one or two lunch periods per year.</p>
<p>“At this time, we are looking for community members to sign up so we can make contact with them,” Furlong said. “We would like the professionals to provide a small, 10-to-15-minute presentation of their work. They can bring in tools or show pictures or do an activity with the kids. They can also just do a PowerPoint presentation or show websites. It’s up to the professionals.”</p>
<p>The goal is to introduce professionals from a variety of careers to students to help them begin thinking about their own future.</p>
<p>Parents and interested community members are asked to fill out an online form at <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/G7fDdA82d1feXmZi1">https://goo.gl/forms/G7fDdA82d1feXmZi1</a></p>

</span></p>
<p>Ridgeview STEM Jr. High will be hosting a <strong>Cyber Safety Day</strong> on Friday, October 7. As part of this day, all students will see the video “Sticks and Stones” in their classrooms followed by a discussion facilitated by their teachers. “Sticks and Stones” is a comprehensive look at several relevant issues facing teens today, particularly regarding the dangers of internet bullying, harassment, peer pressure, peer conflict, hate speech and suicide. The film also highlights the inherent dangers of on-line communications and provides a forum for discussing effective conflict resolution skills and social/emotional coping strategies.</p>
<p>In addition, Lisa Long, an assistant prosecutor from the Fairfield County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, will present on Cyberbullying and Sexting, and Diane Jablonski from the Federal Trade Commission will speak about Cyber Safety.</p>
<p>We will be previewing the film for parents on Monday and Tuesday after school from 2:20 to 3:05. Feel free to come to our Media Center on either of those days to watch the video and ask the school counselors any questions you may have about the day. We think it is vitally important to share with all of our students the safe use the internet. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the school counselors, Eileen McGarvey and Kris Owen.</p>

<p><u><strong>Otis Lennon Testing</strong><br />
</u></p>
<p>On Monday, October 17 the <strong>Otis Lennon School Ability Test (OLSAT)</strong> will be administered to all seventh grade students in their Social Studies classes. This test is a measurement of abstract thinking and cognitive ability of children. The Otis-Lennon is a group-administered multiple choice test, taken with pencil and paper, measures verbal, quantitative, and spatial reasoning ability. The test yields verbal and nonverbal scores, from which a total score is derived, called a School Ability Index (SAI).</p>
<p>OLSAT measures the cognitive abilities that relate to a student’s ability to learn in school. By assessing a student’s abstract thinking and reasoning abilities, OLSAT supplies educators with information they can use to enhance the insight that traditional achievement tests provide. There is nothing the student needs to do to prepare for this test other than to take the test seriously and to work steadily through it so they can finish this timed test.</p>

<p>We are off to a great start at Ridgeview! I have been very proud of our Tigers and how they have conducted themselves. I have had multiple reports from staff letting me know that students have been turning in missing i-phones they have found, helping students in class, cleaning up trash in the cafeteria and offering to help in the classroom. These are all great qualities in our students and I am very proud of them. Acts of kindness go a long way in building a great atmosphere for everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Football Friday Night is here! Tonight is the first home football game. I have been making announcements letting the students know the expectations as they attend football games and/or other extra curricular activities. Thank you in advance for helping set this expectation with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students were assigned lockers this past Wednesday and practiced working them during their E/I time. Just as a reminder, we are asking students to visit their lockers before school, in-between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> period and after school. Students need to plan for their morning classes, lunch and then their afternoon classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Student schedules are pretty much set! Student fees have been posted on Infinite Campus. Please take a moment to log in to your Parent Portal and pay your fees. All fees are due November 18, 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district has been sending messages requesting families to update their contact information on infinite campus. As a reminder, the district will no longer be using Once Call Now (ONC). All messages will be released from Infinite Campus Messenger. Again please take a moment to log into your Parent Portal and update your contact information. We would hate for you to miss any important news!</p>

<p>Start Talking is an initiative aimed at helping parents in keeping our kids drug free. Using the link below, you can access this website and sign up to receive 2 emails a month with facts and tips about alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. Children whose parents talk about these dangers are 50% less likely to use in the first place.

                        <p>The counseling staff at Ridgeview STEM Junior High would like to welcome you to the new school year!  We are excited to work with the students and want you to know that we have worked very hard to get students in the correct classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to encourage you to monitor your child&#8217;s progress in their classes very regularly.  Our school district&#8217;s student/parent portal is called Infinite Campus. Through Infinite Campus, you will be able to monitor your child&#8217;s grades, assignments, and attendance and communicate with their teachers.  Teachers do their best to keep these grades updated weekly.  If you have any questions about whether an assignment has been turned in or why your student performed poorly on a test, reach out to the teacher through the portal.  If your child knows you will be checking on him/her regularly, you will most likely see better results!  It truly takes teamwork for each of our students to be successful in school and you are a VERY important part of that team.  To learn more about accessing Infinite Campus please go to <a href="../../parent-portal/index.html">http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/parent-portal/</a>. On this webpage is a technology help desk link, if you are having difficulty accessing the portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will also be meeting with our students soon to teach them how to use a very helpful web resource called Naviance Family Connection.  Each student has or will have a login to this site.  On this web site, you will find many tools to help with career and college exploration. Students can build resumes, do a college or scholarship search, and take career interest and personality inventories, which match the student&#8217;s characteristics to careers. This is a great opportunity to begin preparing students for the, not so distant, future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are very excited to report our second WEB orientation was held on Friday, August 19.  We had a motivating interactive assembly for our seventh graders with the help of our WEB leaders.  WEB (Where Everyone Belongs) is a data driven international program designed to create schools that, not only teach students, but reach them as well.   WEB includes a student-mentoring program that will continue throughout the year.  Our WEB leaders will periodically be guiding lessons to our E/I periods.</p>

                        <p>With funding and assistance provided by <strong><u>The United Way of Fairfield County,</u> </strong> Ridgeview STEM Jr. High School will again be implementing the WISE program for the 2016/2017 school year.  This year we will have two WISE coaches. One coach who will be staying after school this year to provide extra help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is WISE?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WISE Program is an educational program designed to improve the organizational skill, study skills, and self confidence of junior high school students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When will the WISE program be implemented?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students can select either first, second or third trimester.  This will take the place of one of their electives.  Students selected to the program will meet 5 days per week during the day.  Students will be withdrawn from one of their electives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who will be responsible for working with my child during the WISE program periods?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WISE Program will be implemented by a WISE Coach who is a certified classroom teacher, with experience working with students that struggle with staying organized, studying for tests and quizzes, and completing work consistently in a timely manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is there data proving the program&#8217;s effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the WISE program&#8217;s inception in 2008, data has shown that of the 389 students who have participated, 85% have seen an improvement in grades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>If you are interested in your child participating in the WISE program, contact your child&#8217;s School Counselor at 614-548-1700.  Mrs. Owen works with the 7th grade and Mrs. McGarvey works with the eighth grade.</em></p>
