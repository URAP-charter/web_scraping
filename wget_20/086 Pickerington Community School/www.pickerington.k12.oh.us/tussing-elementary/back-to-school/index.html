                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Tussing Families, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you believe it?  It’s already time to start thinking about next school year.  We could not be more excited to welcome you all back into the building as our custodians have been working tirelessly to get the building ready.  The first day of school will be on </span><b>August 16th for students grades 1-4,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and on </span><b>August 19th for our Kindergarteners</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   The 2016-2017 school year promises to be a great one, and the staff at Tussing Elementary eagerly awaits your arrival.  </span></p>
<p>Before the school year officially gets up and running, we would like to invite you back for a few events.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Friday, August 12th</em> </strong>will be our <em>Back to School Night</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>.</em>  During this event you will have a chance to visit your child’s teacher as well as explore key locations, reunite with friendly faces and learn about opportunities that await your child throughout the year.  This event will be held in two separate sessions.  See below for specific arrival times.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <em><strong>Saturday, August 13th</strong></em> our amazing Tussing PTO will be sponsoring a <em>Summer Movie Night! </em> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be an event for the whole family to enjoy a late night movie outside before the routine of an early bedtime begins.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b>We will be sending more information about the upcoming events with your class enrollment letter at the beginning of August.  You can also find important dates right here on the Tussing Website, so keep checking back with us.  We look forward to our partnership with our families, so that we can ensure each child reaches his/her potential.  Through our collaborative efforts we will continue to witness why Tussing is such a great place to be!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely, </span></p>

                                        <div class="full">
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Tussing Families,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tussing Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) would love to welcome you to our team. It’s a new school year, with new beginnings. Your child(ren) may be returning or making their first steps in our hallways, your Tussing PTO wants to nurture each child’s experience with lasting memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PTO is a non-profit organization, we are not a part of any state or national affiliation. Our committee is made up of 6 chairs; President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, Ways/Means and Social Coordinator. We help our school by raising funds for activities, resources and events not covered by our school budget. Fundraisers are essential to the success of our school. 100% of all funds raised go directly back to us.  We responsibly use the money to help support Tussing Elementary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, who can be a member? Are you a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">father, mother, protector, guardian, and/or a person who teaches/instructs at Tussing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you answered YES, then you are automatically a member. Becoming an active member is simple, attend one of our monthly meeting to discover opportunities to support our school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few programs that we sponsor and/or support: Fall Family Night, School Spring Book Fairs, Valentines Dance, Carnival, Teacher Appreciation, Fun Day, and various other fundraisers throughout the year. This is where </span><b>YOU</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> come in.  I truly understand how daunting volunteering can be.  Questions such as: How much time are we talking about here? Will I be required to take on event or committee responsibilities? Or something as simple as, what exactly is required of me? Are all very normal. I am here to assure you that we will never force anyone to dedicate more time than they are willing.  </span><b>ANY</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time that </span><b>ANY</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> individual is willing to offer is more valuable than I can relate!  We also understand that in today&#8217;s world it is increasingly more difficult to be able to find time to give, even such as one to two hours once a month, which is how often the committee meets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volunteering doesn&#8217;t mean a huge time commitment.  Whatever your time schedule and interests are, we have need of you.  We have tasks that can be performed in the evenings, during the day or that don&#8217;t even involve coming to the school at all. Volunteering your time is such a priceless gift with lasting benefits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our primary way to communicate with you will be via email and social media (Facebook: “Tussing Elementary PTO”). Please understand that our office staff goes over and beyond for our children every day which keeps them busy during school hours, consider emailing us instead of calling the school directly. PTO works directly with the school and will make every effort to answer any PTO related question or concern including any interest in being an more active member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to an amazing school year. Open communication is key to our success. Your voice is welcomed and needed. We look forward to meeting you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keisha Robinson</span></p>

                        <p>The district assesses a fee to all students for supplies and consumable materials. These fees are typically available on the Infinite Campus Parent Portal a few weeks after the start of school. (This delay allows for students to change courses at the junior high and high school levels.)</p>
<p><strong>The preferred method of payment is by logging into the <a href="../../parent-portal/index.html" target="_blank">Parent Portal on Infinite Campus</a>.</strong> While schools will accept a check or cash, paying via the Parent Portal ensures there is a record of payment (and that students do not misplace a check or cash.)</p>
<p>Where applicable, the cost of the student planners is be included in the school fees. Families who are financially unable to pay for necessary materials should refer to board policy for fee waivers. Applications are available in the school office. Failure to pay school fees will result in school records being held until payment is received.</p>

It also may include pictures or other representations of students’ artistic work, including visual and written pieces.</p>
<p class="p1">We also occasionally will have members of the local media visiting our buildings to cover special events and unique approaches to education being offered by our teachers. <b>Media access to students does not happen within our schools without district knowledge and supervision, and we do not provide direct access to students when the media is covering stories or topics that might be considered controversial or negative.</b></p>
<p class="p1">Most parents enjoy seeing their children included in the day-to-day celebration of all the great things happening in our schools. For that reason, default consent and release for this type of recognition is granted to the district. However, we know there are a few parents who prefer that their children not be included in such photographs and online stories. <b>Action is only required by parents who wish to deny this consent.</b></p>
<p class="p1">We require those parents to inform us, in writing, of their desire to have their children excluded from district-managed recognition by downloading <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/opt-out-form-2016.pdf" target="_blank">this form</a>, filling it out, and returning it to their child’s school. Parents are asked to do this by Sept. 1 each fall to ensure we have a current list of students whose activities should not be publicly acknowledged by the district on the website, on social media, or in other public forums.</p>

                        <p>How long until my child’s bus arrives to pick him up? How long until her bus gets her home from school?</p>
<p>A new mobile application will tell Pickerington School parents approximately where their child’s bus is in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>For information and links to download and set up the free “Bus Tracker” application, go to <a href="http://www.durhamschoolservices.com/pages/durhambustracker.aspx">http://www.durhamschoolservices.com/pages/durhambustracker.aspx</a>. Parents will need their children’s student ID numbers to set up the app.</p>
<p>Parents should not use the system to wait until the very last minute to send their children to the bus stop. Students must be at their designated stop by the scheduled bus arrival time, and waiting until the last minute can de dangerous if children are running to meet their bus.</p>
<p>Plus, the system operates by tracking the GPS units in each bus, so it operates on a lag that can be up to two minutes. During that time, the bus may have made progress on its route, so GPS locations are only approximate.</p>
<p>Parents who will likely see the greatest benefit from the application are those who live in the more rural parts of the district and parents of children with special needs.</p>

                        <p>The safety and security of our students is our top priority. That’s why every Pickerington School is required by law to perform annual drills designed to ensure our students and staff are prepared in the event of emergencies.</p>
<p>Such drills are part of every building’s emergency plan. Plans for these drills are developed in cooperation with and assistance of local law enforcement, fire departments, and the Department of Homeland Security. The purpose of these drills is to train, and to learn from that training.</p>
<p><strong>Safety and security drills</strong></p>
<p><strong>Six fire drills:</strong> We hold six drills between August and May. These drills require a complete building evacuation. One drill must be held within the first 10 days of school.</p>
<p><strong>Four tornado drills:</strong> Schools hold one drill in the fall and three drills between March and May. These drills involve moving students to the more structurally secure locations within our building, away from windows.</p>
<p><strong>Three lockdown drills:</strong> Each school performs three lockdown/intruder drills between the months of August and May. The first drill must occur before December. These drills may include either a building evacuation or a lockdown (sometimes known as “shelter in place.”) Local law enforcement agents are on site and participate in these drills. <em><strong>At the junior high school and high school levels, some of these drills are unannounced, which provides a more realistic opportunity to test our preparedness. Unannounced exercises occur toward the end of the school year, after students have gone through training during announced drills.</strong></em> For “unannounced” drills, teachers are notified in advance. Our experience is that some students will text parents when an unannounced drill occurs, so in 2016-17 schools will use Infinite Campus to email parents about shortly before such a drill occurs. Please ensure your contact information and preferences are current in Infinite Campus at www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/parent-portal/</p>
<p><strong>Medical drills:</strong> Schools complete three drills each year to prepare for a possible medical emergency. During these drills, all available staff members report to the area where the medical need is occurring. Students are kept in their classrooms, clear of the area until the emergency is over.</p>
<p><em><strong>Parents should not call the district or come to/call their child’s during drills or actual emergencies. This distracts district staff and law enforcement, which creates additional risks to the safety and security of our children.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you have any questions about these drills, please contact your school.</p>

The mobile app will also allow for you to set up push notifications regarding your student’s balance.</p>
<p>Through the system, parents can check their children’s cafeteria balances and purchase histories, make prepayments for breakfast and lunch with auto-pay capability, and receive email reminders if account balances get low.</p>
<p>We highly encourage you to at least set up an account so you can be included in any direct messaging from our nutrition department.</p>
<p>Thank you for partnering with us in an effort to make managing your student’s account easy and the fall transition a smooth one.</p>

                        <p><strong>Setting up low-balance email notifications and auto payments online</strong></p>
<p>Step one: Log-in to your account at: <a href="http://www.mypaymentsplus.com/" target="_blank">www.MyPaymentsPlus.com</a></p>
<p>Step two: Each of the customized settings have a button pertaining to that setting. Those buttons are “Low Balance Notifications,” “Auto Pay,” “Online Payment History,” and “Purchase History.”</p>
<p>Step three: By clicking either the “Low-Balance Notifications” button or the “Auto-Pay button,” you will then enter the dollar amount that you want to outline as the “lowest amount” your student’s account will hit before a low-balance e-mail notification or auto-payment is processed.</p>
<p>Step four: If your school offers both “Meal” and “General” accounts for their cafeteria deposits, be sure to click the box for the desired account in which you are referring to. (As a reminder, Meal accounts allow for one plated meal per lunch/breakfast, whereas the General account enables the student to eat multiple meals and a la carte options.)</p>
<p>Step five: Be sure to click “Save Changes” when you are finished.</p>

<p><b>Confidentiality:</b> Food Service will provide information about your child&#8217;s eligibility to other school officials. This information is used to determine if your child is eligible for a waiver of school instructional fees. <strong>On the application, p</strong><b>lease check the box &#8220;yes&#8221; if you want this information shared. Check &#8220;no&#8221; if you do not want this information shared. Please sign the waiver choice.</b> Answering the question either way will not change whether your child will get meal benefits.</p>

New applications must be received in the Food Service office no later than September 28, 2016, or your child will be dropped from the program.</p>

                        <p>Each week the H.O.P.E. Packs Program offers a weekend bag of food for children who meet the requirements. If your child in the past has received a H.O.P.E. Pack, have been eligible for free or reduced lunch, or your household income is low, <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HOPE-PACK-APPLICATION-FORM.doc" target="_blank">complete the attached application</a> to receive the weekly bags throughout the school year.</p>
<p>Before going home each Friday, your child will pick up a bag of food from his or her school’s office. The food is intended to be kid-friendly, easy to prepare, and supply supplemental food over the weekend. The bags are not to be opened until your child gets home.</p>
<p>To sign up for this free program, <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HOPE-PACK-APPLICATION-FORM.doc" target="_blank">complete the included application</a> and return it to your child’s school. All personal information will be strictly confidential. Eligible students will not be able to receive their food until the attached form has been completed and returned.</p>

                        <p>The Ohio Department of Education and the Ohio Department of Public Safety have launched the SaferOH tip line that will accept both calls and texts 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>This tip line allows students and adults to anonymously share information with school officials and law enforcement about threats to student safety—whether that involves a threatened mass incident or harm to a single student.</p>
<p>Every tip can remain anonymous. School safety analysts may ask for additional information, but the caller can remain secret or leave his or her contact information for later follow-up.</p>
<p>Calls or texts to 844-SaferOH (844-723-3764) are answered by analysts in the Ohio Homeland Security’s Threat Assessment and Prevention (TAP) Unit.  When action is needed, the TAP Unit immediately forwards information to local school officials, local law enforcement agencies and others, if necessary.</p>
