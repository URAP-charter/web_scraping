                        <p>Dear Panther Students and Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>It is with great enthusiasm that I welcome you and your child to the 2016-2017 school year.  The custodial staff, teachers and office personnel have been diligently working over the summer months in preparation for what should be an outstanding year.  We hope that you and your child find the environment at PHSN as <strong><em>Respectful</em></strong>, <strong><em>Responsible</em></strong>, <strong><em>Inclusive</em></strong> and <strong><em>Safe</em></strong>.</p>
<p>To the incoming Freshman Class of 2020, I say welcome!  As our class of 2017 knows, your high school years will go quickly.  I would like to challenge all of our students to set goals and become involved to make everyday count.  We are fortunate to have many outlets for our students to grow and represent our school and community academically, artistically and athletically.  Make it a goal to be involved at PHSN.</p>
<p>I encourage you to visit the district’s website at <a href="../../district-policies-i/index.html">www.pickerington.k12.oh.us</a> for important information. I will send out a weekly “Message from the Principal” to review and update you on important events.  The majority of our communication will be delivered via Infinite Campus. Please visit your parent portal to ensure all directory information is up to date.  You can also follow me on twitter @mr_ulbrich and PHSN on Facebook.</p>
<p>This year our Panther Welcome Days will take place Tuesday, August 9th and Wednesday, August 10th. We will be taking school pictures, providing school I.D.’s, and distributing class schedules.  Emergency forms should be completed online and emailed to our school nurse at <a href="mailto:marni_dreher@plsd.us">marni_dreher@plsd.us</a></p>
<p>It is very important to attend the Panther Welcome Days, because it helps to make everyone prepared for the first day of school with minimal disruption. Enjoy the rest of your summer and we will see you on August 9th and 10th for Panther Welcome Days and August 16<sup>th</sup> for the first day of school.</p>
<p>Best Wishes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>The district assesses a fee to all students for supplies and consumable materials. These fees are typically available on the Infinite Campus Parent Portal a few weeks after the start of school. (This delay allows for students to change courses at the junior high and high school levels.)</p>
<p><strong>The preferred method of payment is by logging into the <a href="../../parent-portal/index.html" target="_blank">Parent Portal on Infinite Campus</a>.</strong> While schools will accept a check or cash, paying via the Parent Portal ensures there is a record of payment (and that students do not misplace a check or cash.)</p>
<p>Where applicable, the cost of the student planners is be included in the school fees. Families who are financially unable to pay for necessary materials should refer to board policy for fee waivers. Applications are available in the school office. Failure to pay school fees will result in school records being held until payment is received.</p>

<p>Regardless of the grade level of your children, it is important that all parents activate their Infinite Campus parent portal account and confirm their communication preferences. This includes ensuring we have your correct email and phone numbers. Otherwise, you will not receive important communications from your child&#8217;s school and the district.</p>
<p>The first step is to try to <a href="https://meta.infinitecampus.org/campus/portal/pickerington.jsp" target="_blank">log into your account</a>. Follow the directions above under &#8220;Update Existing Infinite Campus Information.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have previously activated an account but have forgotten your username/password, click on the &#8220;Help&#8221; button.</p>

<p>Your account will be activated by Pickerington Schools Technology Department personnel. Your username and password will be emailed to you, along with other important information necessary to properly establish your account.</p>

<p class="p1">Sometimes, this recognition appears on district and school websites, in print publications, and in district-controlled social media, including Facebook and Twitter feeds. This recognition may include photos of students, as well as their names, school, grade and teacher’s name. It also may include pictures or other representations of students’ artistic work, including visual and written pieces.</p>
<p class="p1">We also occasionally will have members of the local media visiting our buildings to cover special events and unique approaches to education being offered by our teachers. <b>Media access to students does not happen within our schools without district knowledge and supervision, and we do not provide direct access to students when the media is covering stories or topics that might be considered controversial or negative.</b></p>
<p class="p1">Most parents enjoy seeing their children included in the day-to-day celebration of all the great things happening in our schools. For that reason, default consent and release for this type of recognition is granted to the district. However, we know there are a few parents who prefer that their children not be included in such photographs and online stories. <b>Action is only required by parents who wish to deny this consent.</b></p>
<p class="p1">We require those parents to inform us, in writing, of their desire to have their children excluded from district-managed recognition by downloading <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/opt-out-form-2016.pdf" target="_blank">this form</a>, filling it out, and returning it to their child’s school. Parents are asked to do this by Sept. 1 each fall to ensure we have a current list of students whose activities should not be publicly acknowledged by the district on the website, on social media, or in other public forums.</p>

<p>A new mobile application will tell Pickerington School parents approximately where their child’s bus is in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>For information and links to download and set up the free “Bus Tracker” application, go to <a href="http://www.durhamschoolservices.com/pages/durhambustracker.aspx">http://www.durhamschoolservices.com/pages/durhambustracker.aspx</a>. Parents will need their children’s student ID numbers to set up the app.</p>
<p>Parents should not use the system to wait until the very last minute to send their children to the bus stop. Students must be at their designated stop by the scheduled bus arrival time, and waiting until the last minute can de dangerous if children are running to meet their bus.</p>
<p>Plus, the system operates by tracking the GPS units in each bus, so it operates on a lag that can be up to two minutes. During that time, the bus may have made progress on its route, so GPS locations are only approximate.</p>
<p>Parents who will likely see the greatest benefit from the application are those who live in the more rural parts of the district and parents of children with special needs.</p>

                        <p>The safety and security of our students is our top priority. That’s why every Pickerington School is required by law to perform annual drills designed to ensure our students and staff are prepared in the event of emergencies.</p>
<p>Such drills are part of every building’s emergency plan. Plans for these drills are developed in cooperation with and assistance of local law enforcement, fire departments, and the Department of Homeland Security. The purpose of these drills is to train, and to learn from that training.</p>
<p><strong>Safety and security drills</strong></p>
<p><strong>Six fire drills:</strong> We hold six drills between August and May. These drills require a complete building evacuation. One drill must be held within the first 10 days of school.</p>
<p><strong>Four tornado drills:</strong> Schools hold one drill in the fall and three drills between March and May. These drills involve moving students to the more structurally secure locations within our building, away from windows.</p>
<p><strong>Three lockdown drills:</strong> Each school performs three lockdown/intruder drills between the months of August and May. The first drill must occur before December. These drills may include either a building evacuation or a lockdown (sometimes known as “shelter in place.”) Local law enforcement agents are on site and participate in these drills. <em><strong>At the junior high school and high school levels, some of these drills are unannounced, which provides a more realistic opportunity to test our preparedness. Unannounced exercises occur toward the end of the school year, after students have gone through training during announced drills.</strong></em> For “unannounced” drills, teachers are notified in advance. Our experience is that some students will text parents when an unannounced drill occurs, so in 2016-17 schools will use Infinite Campus to email parents about shortly before such a drill occurs. Please ensure your contact information and preferences are current in Infinite Campus at www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/parent-portal/</p>
<p><strong>Medical drills:</strong> Schools complete three drills each year to prepare for a possible medical emergency. During these drills, all available staff members report to the area where the medical need is occurring. Students are kept in their classrooms, clear of the area until the emergency is over.</p>
<p><em><strong>Parents should not call the district or come to/call their child’s during drills or actual emergencies. This distracts district staff and law enforcement, which creates additional risks to the safety and security of our children.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you have any questions about these drills, please contact your school.</p>

<p>As we approach the 2016-2017 school year, we ask that you take a moment and create a free account at<a href="http://www.mypaymentsplus.com/" target="_blank">www.MyPaymentsPlus.com</a>. Obtaining a free parent account will give you 24/7 access to information such as the balance in your student’s school meal account and record of what they have purchased in the cafeteria.</p>
<p><strong>Place money on your “MYPaymentsPlus” account</strong></p>
<p>Go <a href="https://www.mypaymentsplus.com/" target="_blank">online</a> or call 1-866-711-7341. For a $2 fee, through MyPaymentsPlus, you are able to deposit funds directly into your student’s cafeteria account. Deposits can take place both on the MyPaymentsPlus website and via the mobile app. You may also add money to your student’s account on the phone by calling 866-711-7341.</p>
<p>If you prefer auto-payments, you have that ability as well. The system will even allow you to set the parameters for when you would like an auto-payment to take place.</p>

The mobile app will also allow for you to set up push notifications regarding your student’s balance.</p>
<p>Through the system, parents can check their children’s cafeteria balances and purchase histories, make prepayments for breakfast and lunch with auto-pay capability, and receive email reminders if account balances get low.</p>
<p>We highly encourage you to at least set up an account so you can be included in any direct messaging from our nutrition department.</p>
<p>Thank you for partnering with us in an effort to make managing your student’s account easy and the fall transition a smooth one.</p>

                        <p><strong>Setting up low-balance email notifications and auto payments online</strong></p>
<p>Step one: Log-in to your account at: <a href="http://www.mypaymentsplus.com/" target="_blank">www.MyPaymentsPlus.com</a></p>
<p>Step two: Each of the customized settings have a button pertaining to that setting. Those buttons are “Low Balance Notifications,” “Auto Pay,” “Online Payment History,” and “Purchase History.”</p>
<p>Step three: By clicking either the “Low-Balance Notifications” button or the “Auto-Pay button,” you will then enter the dollar amount that you want to outline as the “lowest amount” your student’s account will hit before a low-balance e-mail notification or auto-payment is processed.</p>
<p>Step four: If your school offers both “Meal” and “General” accounts for their cafeteria deposits, be sure to click the box for the desired account in which you are referring to. (As a reminder, Meal accounts allow for one plated meal per lunch/breakfast, whereas the General account enables the student to eat multiple meals and a la carte options.)</p>
<p>Step five: Be sure to click “Save Changes” when you are finished.</p>

                        <p>The goal of Pickerington Schools Food Service is to improve the health and education of our students and staff by providing nutritionally well-balanced meals. Menus are available in all school offices and cafeterias. Reduced-price lunch is 40 cents. Breakfast is served at Central, Lakeview, Ridgeview, Diley, Harmon, Toll Gate Middle, Fairfield, Heritage, Pickerington, Tussing and Violet. Reduced-price breakfast is 30 cents.</p>
<p><b>Free/reduced-price meals:</b> Your children may be eligible for free or reduced-price meals. If you wish to apply for meal benefits, please read the instructions below and complete the application. Fill out the application <a href="http://onlineapps.pickerington.k12.oh.us/" target="_blank">online</a> or <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lunch-application.pdf" target="_blank">download, print, and complete the application on the link below</a>. <b>Use one application for all students in your household.</b> We cannot approve an application that is not complete.</p>
<p>Do not fill out an application if you received a letter about direct certification for free meals. Contact the school if any of your children are not listed on the certification letter.</p>
<p>Children receiving SNAP (formerly food stamps) or OWF are eligible for free meal benefits. If your total household income is the same or less than the amounts shown on the income chart, your child may receive free or reduced-price meals. A foster child is eligible to receive free meals regardless of your household income. If you receive WIC your child may be eligible for meal benefits. Please fill out an application. Homeless, runaway, and migrant children receive free meals. Please call the school or your homeless or migrant coordinator to see if your child(ren) qualify. You may apply even if you or your child(ren) are not a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>When filling out an application you must include all people living in your household, related or not (such as grandparents, other relatives, or friends.) You must include yourself and all children who live with you. You must include income from everyone living in the household, related or not. Call 866-711-7341 to check to see if your child’s application is approved. We will notify you in writing only if your application is denied.</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong> School officials may ask you at any time during the school year to provide proof of eligibility.</p>
<p><b>Fair Hearing:</b> Contact Pickerington Food Services if you do not agree with the decision on your application or the results of verification. If you are not satisfied after speaking to Food Service, you may ask for a fair hearing by writing Vince Utterback, Business Manager, Pickerington Schools, 90 East St., Pickerington, OH 43147, or by calling 614-833-2110.</p>

<p><b>Reapplication:</b> You may apply for meal benefits any time during the school year. If you are not eligible now but have a decrease in household income, become unemployed, have an increase in household size, or receive SNAP (formerly food stamps) or OWF for your child, you may reapply.</p>
<p><b>Confidentiality:</b> Food Service will provide information about your child’s eligibility to other school officials. This information is used to determine if your child is eligible for a waiver of school instructional fees. <strong>On the application, p</strong><b>lease check the box “yes” if you want this information shared. Check “no” if you do not want this information shared. Please sign the waiver choice.</b> Answering the question either way will not change whether your child will get meal benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Last year’s eligibility:</strong> Children who were approved last year must have a new application approved this year to continue receiving meal benefits. New applications must be received in the Food Service office no later than September 28, 2016, or your child will be dropped from the program.</p>
<p><b>Special dietary needs:</b> All meals served in our cafeterias meet meal pattern requirements and national dietary guidelines; however, if a child has a disability that prevents eating regular school meals, we will make doctor prescribed substitutions at no extra charge. If you believe your child has special dietary needs due to a disability, you may contact Food Service Supervisor Judy Riley at 614-833-3645.</p>
<p><strong>Online applications:</strong> Online applications are now available. You may apply and submit your application for meal benefits after August 3, 2016, <a href="http://onlineapps.pickerington.k12.oh.us/" target="_blank">at this link</a>.</p>

                        <p>The Ohio Department of Education and the Ohio Department of Public Safety have launched the SaferOH tip line that will accept both calls and texts 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>This tip line allows students and adults to anonymously share information with school officials and law enforcement about threats to student safety—whether that involves a threatened mass incident or harm to a single student.</p>
<p>Every tip can remain anonymous. School safety analysts may ask for additional information, but the caller can remain secret or leave his or her contact information for later follow-up.</p>
<p>Calls or texts to 844-SaferOH (844-723-3764) are answered by analysts in the Ohio Homeland Security’s Threat Assessment and Prevention (TAP) Unit.  When action is needed, the TAP Unit immediately forwards information to local school officials, local law enforcement agencies and others, if necessary.</p>
