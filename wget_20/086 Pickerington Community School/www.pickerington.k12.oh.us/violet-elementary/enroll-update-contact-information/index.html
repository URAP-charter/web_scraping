The Welcome Center is open year around. We encourage you to register your children as soon as you move into the Pickerington area. Enrollments for grades 1 through 12 for the 2017-18 school year will begin May 1, 2017.            </div>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The first step in the process is to identify yourself as an &#8220;existing&#8221; or &#8220;new&#8221; family in the district.</span></p>
<p><strong>Existing families</strong> are those who have a student currently enrolled in our district. These families should register students by logging into their existing <a href="https://meta.infinitecampus.org/campus/portal/pickerington.jsp" target="_blank">Infinite Campus</a> parent portal account. If you do not know your access information, please submit an online <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/plsd.us/forms/d/1H5aiKZSNE_BdDM29kFyC-9JwI_1_ssKd-sMWelRF31E/viewform?formkey=dEtwUm9JdmxrM2RnTzlhekxBU2lFeHc6MQ" target="_blank">help request</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New families</strong> have never had a child enrolled in our district. &#8220;New&#8221; families should proceed by going to the <a href="https://meta.infinitecampus.org/campus/onlinereglogin2_pickerington.jsp" target="_blank">online registration form</a>.</p>
<p>Upon completion and submission of this registration, you will receive a verification email asking you to call the Welcome Center to set up an appointment.</p>
<p>At that appointment, you must bring in the following documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDF of online registration summary (if there are any changes)</li>
<li>Birth certificate (original or certified copy.) Children entering kindergarten must be 5 years old by August 1 of that school year to enroll.</li>
<li>Proof of residence (deed, mortgage coupon, mortgage or settlement statement, signed lease, current electric or gas bill showing name and home address). If you are living with a friend or relative, you must complete a <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/friendsandfamily.pdf">friends and family affidavit</a>.</li>
<li>Parent&#8217;s photo ID</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/immunizations-2015.pdf">Immunization records</a></li>
<li>Custody documents, if applicable. (This may include a judge-signed, court-stamped divorce or dissolution document.) If you are <strong>not</strong> currently the residential/custodial parent, please call the Welcome Center at 614.920.6180, <strong>before </strong>beginning the enrollment process. Ohio law requires the entire custody document be on file with the school.</li>
<li>Individual Instruction Plan (IEP) or Evaluation Team Report (ETR), if applicable.</li>
<li>All preschool students must have an approval letter or email from the preschool.</li>

                        <p>To balance class sizes across the district, it is sometimes necessary for a registering child to attend a different elementary or middle school than the one within his or her normal attendance area. If this happens, the district will provide transportation to the other school building.</p>
<p>Students will be assigned to class openings on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>Students will not be assigned to a classroom until all paperwork is received by the Welcome Center. Therefore, it is important to get all registration materials turned in as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>All requests for changes of address on school records must be submitted to the Welcome Center for processing. Residential address changes cannot be processed by a child’s school office staff or by Petermann Transportation.</p>
<p>Any changes to a student’s home address must be requested on the district’s <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/change-of-student-information-2.pdf">change of student information form</a>. This form includes a standard authorization, to be signed by the parent, allowing for the release of residential and utility information to Pickerington Schools upon request, if necessary.</p>
<p>This release also includes an explanation, per Ohio Revised Code, as to how it is determined where your child is to receive his/her tuition-free, public school education. By signing this release, you are also verifying that you have been informed of your legal responsibility to withdraw a child from school if you ever move outside school district boundaries. It also informs you of your tuition obligations if you fail to withdraw.</p>
<p>If you do not have the capability to print the form, contact the Welcome Center at 614.920.6180. We will be happy to mail, email or fax the form to you for completion. You also may pick up or return the form directly to the Welcome Center, rather than turning it in at your school office for intra-office transfer to us. This expedites the address change process.</p>
<p>After a <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/change-of-student-information-2.pdf">change of student information form</a> is received at our Welcome Center, the request will be checked to verify that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the request has been signed and dated by the parent of the student;</li>
<li>acceptable proof of the change in residence is attached to the request;</li>
<li>an open enrollment request has been completed, if applicable. This is necessary if a change of residence, made during the school year, causes a change in the student’s attendance area but the parent wishes to have the student finish the current school year at his/her current building. Such a request is only considered for the student’s continued attendance through the end of the current school year. Note that buses do not cross school boundary lines to accommodate open enrollment students. Parents are responsible for transportation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the move has caused a change in the building the student is to attend, the involved school buildings are notified and the electronic and physical transfer of records takes place. Arrangements for the official start date in the new school can be made between you and the office staff of your child&#8217;s new school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bus transportation after change of address</strong></p>
<p>The Welcome Center will notify Petermann Transportation of your change of home address. If bus service is available in your new area for your child, we begin the steps needed to arrange a new bus stop location “from and to” your new residence. Petermann staff establish all bus stops and notify drivers as quickly as possible. Your school building office staff will obtain all bus stop information from Petermann Transportation.</p>
<p>If a new bus stop must be established at any point in the route where the driver does not currently make a stop, this process may take two to three days. If necessary, your child&#8217;s school office can issue a bus pass if your child must ride the bus before the change can be finalized by Petermann Transportation.</p>
<p>This change in address change procedure applies only to changes in the actual physical address where a parent and the student reside. A <em>temporary</em> change of bus stop location at a place other than the student’s home (for situations such as babysitting arrangements) may be accepted in the school office of the building where your child attends.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/change-of-bus-route.pdf">form requesting a new bus stop location</a> can be downloaded from Petermann Transportation. The Welcome Center does not handle these changes. The forms should be submitted to your child’s school office or faxed them directly to Petermann Transportation.</p>

                        <p>Children entering kindergarten must be 5 years old by August 1 of that school year to enroll. For more information, see <a href="../../school-policies/index.html">district policies and regulations</a> JEB and JEB-REG (Entrance Age), as well as JEBA and JEBA-REG (Early Entrance in Kindergarten-Grade 1.)</p>
<p>To start the kindergarten registration process, parents fill out the <a href="https://meta.infinitecampus.org/campus/onlinereglogin2_pickerington.jsp" target="_blank">online registration form</a> through Infinite Campus. <strong>This form will not be active for the 2017-18 school year until Thursday, March 16, 2017.</strong></p>
<p>The first step in the process is to identify yourself as an “existing” or “new” family in the district.</p>
<p><strong>Existing families</strong> are those who have a student currently enrolled in our district. These families should register students by logging into their existing <a href="https://meta.infinitecampus.org/campus/portal/pickerington.jsp" target="_blank">Infinite Campus</a> parent portal account. If you do not know your access information, see the Infinite Campus information below.</p>
<p><strong>New families</strong> have never had a child enrolled in our district. “New” families should proceed by going to the <a href="https://meta.infinitecampus.org/campus/onlinereglogin2_pickerington.jsp" target="_blank">online registration form</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kindergarten registration for the 2017-18 school year will begin online Thursday, March 16, 2017.</strong></p>

                        <p>The Pickerington Preschool is a program that enhances and encourages learning for children with disabilities and typically developing children. We welcome children ages 3-5 years of age, while offering a range of services free to children with a qualifying disability; typical developing peers are enrolled on a tuition basis. All children are provided with a typical preschool experience and the opportunity to interact with children of all abilities.</p>
<p>Parents interested in applying for Pickerington Preschool for the 2016-17 school year begin the process by filling out the preschool application.</p>
<p>Once this is submitted, you will be contacted by a Preschool staff member.</p>
<p>Complete information about Pickerington Preschool is available on the <a href="../../pickerington-preschool/index.html">preschool web pages</a>.</p>

                        <p>It is very important that an address be changed as soon as the move occurs. Both Pickerington Schools and Petermann Bus Transportation need the most up-to-date information to better serve our families.</p>
<p>To change an address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete a <a href="../../forms/index.html" target="_blank">Change of Student Information form</a></li>
<li>Return form to the Welcome Center with proof of new residency (i.e., signed settlement statement, signed lease agreement, current electric or gas bill)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the new address results in a school building transfer, it will take one to two days to process that transfer with the schools and Petermann.</p>
<p>If the new address results in a school building transfer, but parent would like student to remain at current school, an <a href="../../forms/index.html" target="_blank">Intradistrict Building Transfer Request</a> form will also need to be completed for approval.</p>
<p>Note: If the address change coincides with a custody change, the parent will need to submit custody documents as well.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns, please contact the Welcome Center at 614.920.6180.</p>

            <h2>Intradistrict Building Transfer</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Pickerington students attend school on a neighborhood-school basis. That is, their “home school” is the one in the attendance area in which they are assigned as determined by school boundaries and approved by the Board of Education.</p>
<p>However, board policy allows that, in conjunction with state law, students be given the opportunity to attend a school within the district other than the one to which they would regularly be assigned. Students who live in the assigned attendance area or are otherwise assigned to a building by the district administration get first preference over students requesting an intradistrict transfer.</p>
<p>Second preference will be given to students who do not currently live in the assigned attendance area but were previously enrolled in a school building.</p>
<p>It is possible for parents to request to have their children be considered to transfer to a different school than the one he or she typically would attend based on location of residence. If approved, transportation to the new school is the responsibility of the parent. Parents of children in grades K-6 must submit a request each year. Parents of children in grades 7-12 are only required to apply once.</p>
<p>Details about intradistrict building transfer is detailed under Pickerington Board of Education <a href="../../district-policies/index.html">Policy JECBD and JECBD-REG</a> and on the <a href="../../forms/index.html" target="_blank">intradistrict transfer request form</a> found in our Forms section under &#8220;Enrolling and Open Enrollment.&#8221;</p>
