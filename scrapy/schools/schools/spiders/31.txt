Dear Socrates Academy Families and Friends,  Thank you for your ongoing support to the Socrates Academy Annual Fund! Your Annual Fund Gift will have a positive and meaningful impact on the lives of our Socrates Scholars. Will you please join the many parents, staff, and board members who have already contributed to this year’s campaign? Your support will enhance and expand educational opportunities for scholars at our National Blue Ribbon School, one of the top 1% schools in the United States! Your donation can make our great school even better. Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations:  1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success – Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books – A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers.  Today, charter schools like Socrates Academy receive considerable less per-pupil revenue than district-run traditional public schools. In order to overcome this funding gap and continue to offer award-winning educational and extracurricular programs, Socrates Academy must maintain a supplemental stream of revenue. We’re reaching out to ask for your participation and support again this year. Your donation will be used to support our 2018-2019 goals and will have a direct impact on our school’s success.
