If you are coming from Antioch Church Road, we encourage you to turn right into the lower parking lot (entrance near the Couchell Building). 	 Do not stop in front of a building. Proceed to the front of the line when dropping off your scholars.	 There is NO passing in carpool line. ​Tardy ScholarsElementary scholars who arrive in the lot after 8:10am are considered tardy. Secondary School scholars who arrive after 8:00am,are considered tardy. 	 Parents must sign their children in at the front office (Elementary scholars get signed in at the Couchell Building, and Secondary School scholars get signed in at the Secondary School building) to get a tardy slip.​Dismissal Procedures Cars may not line up in either parking lot before 3:00 pm.​​Carpool SignsCarpool signs should be placed in the dashboard window and kept in the window until you leave the parking lot. If a carpool sign is not present, the car will be pulled to the side, driver ID checked, and driver verified as an authorized driver on the carpool form with the office staff.	 Please keep your carpool sign from year to year, unless there is a change that needs to be made to the sign. It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. ​​Afternoon Carpool (6-8 Students)All cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. 	 If your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area.	 Begins at 3:30 pm. Grades 6-8 are dismissed from the upper parking lot. Parents will enter through the entrance between the painted rocks and will exit via Simfield Church Road.​Afternoon Carpool (K-5 Students)Begins at 3:30pm. Grades 4 and 5 are dismissed from the upper parking lot (with and without siblings). 	 Grades K-3 are dismissed from the lower lot (only if they do not have 4th-8th grade siblings).	 All students will go to the classroom of their older sibling for carpool. This includes K-3 students that have siblings in Middle School. 	 K-3 students with Middle School siblings, will not come into the Middle School, but will be supervised in the 4th and 5th Grade building. They will be called at the same time that their Middle School Sibling is called. The siblings will meet at the carpool zone.  There are NO left turns out of the school parking lots between the hours of 3:15pm-4:15pm. Cars must be in the parking lot before 3:55pm. If you arrive after carpool has ended, your student will be sent to Afterschool. There is a $1.00 per minute charge up to a maximum of $20.00 for this service.​​ ​General Guidelines WalkersScholars who walk must live within one mile of the school, and parents must complete a form to be approved by the administration.	 If a parent is driving a car to pick up a walker, then he or she must go through the carpool line.	 Elementary walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet in front of the Elementary Building.	 Middle School walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet at the roundabout near the Secondary School.​​Church Next DoorWe are NOT using the church next door for parking or carpool. Parents who park at the church do so at their own risk and may be towed. Parents are not to wait in the church parking lot until it is 3:00pm, when you are permitted to enter our lot for elementary dismissal.​​Cell PhonesCell phone use is prohibited to ensure that everyone is focused on keeping our scholars safe. Thank you for helping us maintain safety for everyone! Special NeedsIf you have a child with special needs, who may need additional assistance for morning and/or afternoon carpool please contact Vanessa Baker vbaker@socratesacademy.us or 704.321.1711 X175​Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ORDER SPIRIT WEAR | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreSPIRIT WEAR ORDER FORMContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ADMISSIONS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreADMISSIONSPlease read the Frequently Asked Questions before calling the school to inquire about the lottery process. ​Information about the school can also be found on the website under the Our School or you can join us for a tour or take a virtual tour.​ ​Top of PageImportant Lottery DatesVisit SocratesFrequently Asked QuestionsREGISTRARRecords, transcripts & admissions information​Georgia Kastanasgkastanas@socratesacademy.us ​704-321-1711 x100Fax: 704-321-1714​2020-2021STUDENT APPLICATIONSTUDENT APPLICATIONACCEPTANCE PACKETAcceptance packets should only be filled out if you have received confirmation that you have been accepted into an open seat.Apply to Socrates Academy​You may still apply for the current school year until December 15th but you will be added to the end of the wait list for the current year if there are no spots available. (Please Note: Proof of North Carolina residency will be required if you are accepted into Socrates Academy through the lottery process)​Socrates Academy is a North Carolina Public Charter School and to be eligible to attend you must be a legal resident of North Carolina.

The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ACADEMICS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreACADEMICSThe Academy's bilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Standard Course of Study (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). The curriculum is an innovative research-based curriculum, developed by the Socrates Academy Curriculum Committee, which is made up of several distinguished faculty from UNC Charlotte with expertise in various aspects of education, English and other languages, mathematics, and technology. It is important to note that only a small percentage of the students of the Academy are of Greek heritage, and students from diverse cultures and backgrounds are greatly profiting from this approach. While part of each school day is taught in Greek, no prior knowledge of Greek is required.  It is, however, recommended that new students enter the Academy at the earliest grades possible in order to gain the greatest academic benefit. Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytic thinking.  The program is characterized by high academic quality and a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second language. CurriculumLiteracyElementary Students are taught using a balanced literacy approach to reading. This means that we pull the best research-based sources to teach reading and phonics.​Middle School Students Middle school scholars are taught at a rigorous level.

Scholars conduct a series of edits, receiving feedback from peers and teachers.GreekElementary Students attend 50 minutes of Greek Language and 50 minutes of Greek Math each day. K-2nd Greek Math is co-taught with the Greek & Homeroom teachers. Middle School Students attend 54 minutes of Greek Language and 54 minutes of Greek Math each day. Greek Language and Greek Math classes are leveled starting in 5th grade. ​New Students in 5th - 8th grade are started in beginner Greek classes.

The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery.

Its mission is to act as the fundraising arm of the Socrates Academy. All programs, projects and activities funded through the Foundation shall be used to enhance the Academy's educational programs and will be in alignment with its strategic plan, mission statement, goals, and budget considerations. Foundation MembersGretchen CarsonPresident​gcarson@socratesacademy.us Larry PeroulasMember​larry_peroulas@hotmail.comAntonis Stylianou, Ph.D.Member​astylianou@uncc.eduSocrates Foundation Frequently Asked Questions​Why does Socrates Academy need to raise funds? Isn't it a public school?Socrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.  Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.  Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves. ​What is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?Annual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for "brick and mortar type projects".  North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing. ​Are we seeking support from outside the school community?External support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is "What have you been able to raise internally?"  It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community. ​How will my funds be used?Donations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school’s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility. ​What is a Matching Gift Program?When a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization. For example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!Click here to see a list of companies we know that DO have Matching Gift programs Contact UsIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:foundation@socratesacademy.us Socrates Academy Foundation3909 Weddington RoadMatthews, NC 28105704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOL | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreOUR SCHOOL​​Our MissionThe mission of the Socrates Academy is to work in partnership with parents and community to encourage our students to reach their full potential by developing critical, analytical thinking skills and becoming self-confident in a high achieving, multicultural, disciplined environment. Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.​Our Core ValuesOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:• Filotimo (Greek: Φιλότιμο): Αlmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.• Arete (Greek: Αρετή): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.• Philoxenia (Greek: Φιλοξενία): eagerness to show hospitality• Ethos (Greek: Ηθος): Ethical Behavior• Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.• Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.• Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice• Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example• Strive for Excellence (Greek: Αιέν αριστεύειν): Setting goals and always striving to do one’s best and seeking continuous improvement​​The Socrates ApproachThe Academy’s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.  What is the Socratic Method?Definition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition. The Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights. The Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.  This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education. Want to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom? Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSEGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence. We look forward to watching our children flourish in their remaining years at Socrates, and feel confident that they will be well-prepared for the next big transition into high school."​- Mary Beth A., Socrates ParentContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ADMISSIONS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreADMISSIONSPlease read the Frequently Asked Questions before calling the school to inquire about the lottery process. ​Information about the school can also be found on the website under the Our School or you can join us for a tour or take a virtual tour.​ ​Top of PageImportant Lottery DatesVisit SocratesFrequently Asked QuestionsREGISTRARRecords, transcripts & admissions information​Georgia Kastanasgkastanas@socratesacademy.us ​704-321-1711 x100Fax: 704-321-1714​2020-2021STUDENT APPLICATIONSTUDENT APPLICATIONACCEPTANCE PACKETAcceptance packets should only be filled out if you have received confirmation that you have been accepted into an open seat.Apply to Socrates Academy​You may still apply for the current school year until December 15th but you will be added to the end of the wait list for the current year if there are no spots available. (Please Note: Proof of North Carolina residency will be required if you are accepted into Socrates Academy through the lottery process)​Socrates Academy is a North Carolina Public Charter School and to be eligible to attend you must be a legal resident of North Carolina.

Items for purchase include, but are not limited to, chips, drinks, muffins and fruit.FORGOTTEN LUNCHESForgotten lunches should be brought to the Middle School building and placed on the stage. Students are taught to check the stage for their lunch before calling home. If a student has forgotten their lunch and a parent is unable to be reached, they are able to buy lunch with credit from the Hot Lunch counter. The student will need to bring cash money for payment the next day.VISITING DURING LUNCHAny family members visiting during lunch, must sign in with a license at either office. Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom.  We ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch.​If a parent wishes to send in a treat for their child’s birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school. It is the policy of Socrates Academy that all food provided for consumption of our scholars must be commercially prepared, with the ingredient label visible. Our allergy management policy can be found HERE​Volunteers are needed to work behind the Hot Lunch counter and also in the main cafeteria area.

For example, K-2 students begin on November 3rd, NOT November 2nd.Carpool Tag Pick-up & Supply Drop OffFamilies will be given numbers instead of names for carpool this year. Staff working the carpool line will enter the number into a tablet and the name will be displayed on a screen in the child’s classroom. You MUST have a new sign to go through carpool.​Tags can be picked up the week of October 26th Monday - Thursday9am - 10am Monday, Wednesday & Thursday1:30pm - 2:30pm. Tuesday, (Oct. 27th) Evening4:00pm - 6:00pm Pick up will be located behind the Middle School building. Kindergarten may pick up signs and drop off supplies during their practice session. Kindergarten students who are not attending the practice session will need to come during pick up hours. ​Supply Drop OffWe are asking families to drop off supplies when they pick up their carpool tags. You Homeroom teacher will communicate what supplies are needed at this time. Please label all bags or boxes with your child's homeroom teacher. Remote families do not need to send in supplies.​Masks & Temperature ChecksPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.  You will be asked three questions by a staff member: Has your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?Does your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?Does your child have Co vid 19?​If you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.​No Walkers - Morning or AfternoonIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY. Late Pick-UpsStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park and walk to the classroom, where the student will be waiting with his/her Homeroom teacher. After 3 late pick ups, students will be asked to move to Remote Instruction.BRING YOUR OWN DEVICE AGREEMENTREOPENING TRANSITION PLANMOVE TO REMOTEHYBRID PLAN PARENT HANDBOOKFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSASK A QUESTIONPROCEDURE VIDEOS​​Social Distance Tour >> Wear a Mask >>Ducks in a Row - Campus Walks >>Recess Before/After Procedures >>Arrive to Classroom in Morning >> Feeling Sick Procedure >>​Morning Carpool >>​Afternoon Carpool >>ELEMENTARYBELL SCHEDULE ARRIVAL:   7:45am - 8:10amTARDY AFTER:   8:10am​How to Sign In a Tardy StudentStudents who are tardy will need to be checked in by a parent in the Middle School Foyer.

Families are invited to donate to the school to support existing educational programs, develop new curriculum, improve school facilities, and support essential needs of Socrates Academy. The money raised through the Invest in a Scholar program will support exclusively the operational needs of the school and will not be used for any additional land purchases or new buildings being considered by the Board of Directors.WHY SUPPORT THE ANNUAL FUND?DONATE TO THE ANNUAL FUNDSET UP A RECURRING DONATIONThese Fundraisers BenefitOur Annual Fund, too!Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations: ​ 1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success – Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books – A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers. LEARN MOREContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy NEW FAMILIES | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreNEW FAMILIES​FIND A PARENT MENTOR​​If you are new to the school and would like some help learning your way, we would love to pair you with one of our New Parent Navigators!

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us ​What happens if I don't volunteer?Our volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have​ if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school. ​Why do I have to volunteer?North Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools. Charter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.Charter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities. In order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.​How many hours do I have to complete?36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.​ What constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?A volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.  Examples include: Participating in Committee workAttending Town Hall meetings or Board MeetingsPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetingsWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)Working a special eventFulfilling duties for committees	 What does not constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?Eating lunch with your scholarAttending parent/teacher conferences Can other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?We love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.​Can I donate my hours?Yes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together. ​How will my hours be tracked?Use the volunteer log on the website to track your hours. You are now unable to search your hours online. We are looking at solutions, but for now, please make sure your email address is correct when you log your hours, because totals will be sent there. Please use the same email address each time you fill out the volunteer log.​​  Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ABSENTEE REPORTING FORM | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreABSENTEE REPORTING FORMContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy SPIRIT WEAR | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreSpirit Wear​Socrates Academy Spirit Wear is a PFI fundraiser.

The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time.

When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school.

An alternative to bringing lunch is to order from our Hot Lunch Menu. Hot Lunch is prepared off site and brought in to the scholars and must be ordered 2-4 weeks in advance. Learn more about Hot Lunch HERE. Students walk from their classroom to lunch each day with their class and eat in the cafeteria with their teacher. Students are not permitted to share food. Students are not permitted to bring soda in their lunches. Students may not be pulled from class during instruction to have lunch with a sibling unless their lunch schedule is the same. The Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct applies to all student actions during lunch Socrates Academy provides a table in the cafeteria that is to be kept free of the type of allergen(s) that impact theidentified student(s). While this table is available to the identified student(s), they are not be required to eat only at this table. Snacks may be purchased from the Hot Lunch counter with cash only. Items for purchase include, but are not limited to, chips, drinks, muffins and fruit.FORGOTTEN LUNCHESForgotten lunches should be brought to the Middle School building and placed on the stage. Students are taught to check the stage for their lunch before calling home. If a student has forgotten their lunch and a parent is unable to be reached, they are able to buy lunch with credit from the Hot Lunch counter. The student will need to bring cash money for payment the next day.VISITING DURING LUNCHAny family members visiting during lunch, must sign in with a license at either office. Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom.  We ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch.​If a parent wishes to send in a treat for their child’s birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school. It is the policy of Socrates Academy that all food provided for consumption of our scholars must be commercially prepared, with the ingredient label visible. Our allergy management policy can be found HERE​Volunteers are needed to work behind the Hot Lunch counter and also in the main cafeteria area.

Its mission is to act as the fundraising arm of the Socrates Academy. All programs, projects and activities funded through the Foundation shall be used to enhance the Academy's educational programs and will be in alignment with its strategic plan, mission statement, goals, and budget considerations. Foundation MembersGretchen CarsonPresident​gcarson@socratesacademy.us Larry PeroulasMember​larry_peroulas@hotmail.comAntonis Stylianou, Ph.D.Member​astylianou@uncc.eduSocrates Foundation Frequently Asked Questions​Why does Socrates Academy need to raise funds? Isn't it a public school?Socrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.  Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.  Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves. ​What is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?Annual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for "brick and mortar type projects".  North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing. ​Are we seeking support from outside the school community?External support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is "What have you been able to raise internally?"  It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community. ​How will my funds be used?Donations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school’s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility. ​What is a Matching Gift Program?When a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization. For example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!Click here to see a list of companies we know that DO have Matching Gift programs Contact UsIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:foundation@socratesacademy.us Socrates Academy Foundation3909 Weddington RoadMatthews, NC 28105704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy NEW FAMILIES | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreNEW FAMILIES​FIND A PARENT MENTOR​​If you are new to the school and would like some help learning your way, we would love to pair you with one of our New Parent Navigators!

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyMulti Purpose RoomOur cafeteria doubles as an auditorium.

Scholars consistently participate in Socratic Seminars and are challenged to think critically.Science &Social StudiesElementary Students have science and social studies for a semester each. This class is called Integrated Units. These classes follow the NC DPI Standards as a basis for instruction.​Middle School Students have science and social students for a semester each. These classes follow the NC DPI Standards as a basis for instruction.WritingElementary Students learn a balanced literacy approach to writing. We use research-based sources to teach our scholars because we know they work. ​Middle School Students Middle school scholars write expository, narrative and persuasive essays. Scholars conduct a series of edits, receiving feedback from peers and teachers.GreekElementary Students attend 50 minutes of Greek Language and 50 minutes of Greek Math each day. K-2nd Greek Math is co-taught with the Greek & Homeroom teachers. Middle School Students attend 54 minutes of Greek Language and 54 minutes of Greek Math each day. Greek Language and Greek Math classes are leveled starting in 5th grade. ​New Students in 5th - 8th grade are started in beginner Greek classes. Elementary students learn using differentiated instruction.Why Greek? >>MathematicsElementary Students are taught Math using the Singapore method twice daily. Once in English and once in Greek.​Middle School Students are offered Math through High School Math II.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyArt is SmartFrom pottery to Picasso!

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us ​What happens if I don't volunteer?Our volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have​ if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school. ​Why do I have to volunteer?North Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools. Charter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.Charter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities. In order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.​How many hours do I have to complete?36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.​ What constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?A volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.  Examples include: Participating in Committee workAttending Town Hall meetings or Board MeetingsPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetingsWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)Working a special eventFulfilling duties for committees	 What does not constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?Eating lunch with your scholarAttending parent/teacher conferences Can other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?We love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.​Can I donate my hours?Yes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together. ​How will my hours be tracked?Use the volunteer log on the website to track your hours. You are now unable to search your hours online. We are looking at solutions, but for now, please make sure your email address is correct when you log your hours, because totals will be sent there. Please use the same email address each time you fill out the volunteer log.​​  Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyOUR ANNUAL FUND | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreOUR ANNUAL FUNDThe Invest in a Scholar Annual Fund Campaign is our primary opportunity for school families to participate in the continued success of the Academy by helping to bridge the gap left by state and local funding. Families are invited to donate to the school to support existing educational programs, develop new curriculum, improve school facilities, and support essential needs of Socrates Academy. The money raised through the Invest in a Scholar program will support exclusively the operational needs of the school and will not be used for any additional land purchases or new buildings being considered by the Board of Directors.WHY SUPPORT THE ANNUAL FUND?DONATE TO THE ANNUAL FUNDSET UP A RECURRING DONATIONThese Fundraisers BenefitOur Annual Fund, too!Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations: ​ 1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success – Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books – A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers. LEARN MOREContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyRECURRING ANNUAL FUND DONATION | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreRECURRING ANNUAL FUND DONATIONContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOL | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreOUR SCHOOL​​Our MissionThe mission of the Socrates Academy is to work in partnership with parents and community to encourage our students to reach their full potential by developing critical, analytical thinking skills and becoming self-confident in a high achieving, multicultural, disciplined environment. Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.​Our Core ValuesOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:• Filotimo (Greek: Φιλότιμο): Αlmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.• Arete (Greek: Αρετή): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.• Philoxenia (Greek: Φιλοξενία): eagerness to show hospitality• Ethos (Greek: Ηθος): Ethical Behavior• Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.• Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.• Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice• Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example• Strive for Excellence (Greek: Αιέν αριστεύειν): Setting goals and always striving to do one’s best and seeking continuous improvement​​The Socrates ApproachThe Academy’s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.  What is the Socratic Method?Definition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition. The Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights. The Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.  This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education. Want to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom? Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSEGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence. We look forward to watching our children flourish in their remaining years at Socrates, and feel confident that they will be well-prepared for the next big transition into high school."​- Mary Beth A., Socrates ParentContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy SUPPLY LISTS2 | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMore2020-2021 SUPPLY LISTSKindergarten Supply List First Grade Supply List Second Grade Supply List Third Grade Supply List Fourth Grade Supply List Fifth Grade Supply List​Living & Learning Classroom (by assignment only)  MIDDLE SCHOOL6th Grade: Please purchase supplies based on your students first elective choices.

If you are coming from Antioch Church Road, we encourage you to turn right into the lower parking lot (entrance near the Couchell Building). 	 Do not stop in front of a building. Proceed to the front of the line when dropping off your scholars.	 There is NO passing in carpool line. ​Tardy ScholarsElementary scholars who arrive in the lot after 8:10am are considered tardy. Secondary School scholars who arrive after 8:00am,are considered tardy. 	 Parents must sign their children in at the front office (Elementary scholars get signed in at the Couchell Building, and Secondary School scholars get signed in at the Secondary School building) to get a tardy slip.​Dismissal Procedures Cars may not line up in either parking lot before 3:00 pm.​​Carpool SignsCarpool signs should be placed in the dashboard window and kept in the window until you leave the parking lot. If a carpool sign is not present, the car will be pulled to the side, driver ID checked, and driver verified as an authorized driver on the carpool form with the office staff.	 Please keep your carpool sign from year to year, unless there is a change that needs to be made to the sign. It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. ​​Afternoon Carpool (6-8 Students)All cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. 	 If your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area.	 Begins at 3:30 pm. Grades 6-8 are dismissed from the upper parking lot. Parents will enter through the entrance between the painted rocks and will exit via Simfield Church Road.​Afternoon Carpool (K-5 Students)Begins at 3:30pm. Grades 4 and 5 are dismissed from the upper parking lot (with and without siblings). 	 Grades K-3 are dismissed from the lower lot (only if they do not have 4th-8th grade siblings).	 All students will go to the classroom of their older sibling for carpool. This includes K-3 students that have siblings in Middle School. 	 K-3 students with Middle School siblings, will not come into the Middle School, but will be supervised in the 4th and 5th Grade building. They will be called at the same time that their Middle School Sibling is called. The siblings will meet at the carpool zone.  There are NO left turns out of the school parking lots between the hours of 3:15pm-4:15pm. Cars must be in the parking lot before 3:55pm. If you arrive after carpool has ended, your student will be sent to Afterschool. There is a $1.00 per minute charge up to a maximum of $20.00 for this service.​​ ​General Guidelines WalkersScholars who walk must live within one mile of the school, and parents must complete a form to be approved by the administration.	 If a parent is driving a car to pick up a walker, then he or she must go through the carpool line.	 Elementary walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet in front of the Elementary Building.	 Middle School walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet at the roundabout near the Secondary School.​​Church Next DoorWe are NOT using the church next door for parking or carpool. Parents who park at the church do so at their own risk and may be towed. Parents are not to wait in the church parking lot until it is 3:00pm, when you are permitted to enter our lot for elementary dismissal.​​Cell PhonesCell phone use is prohibited to ensure that everyone is focused on keeping our scholars safe. Thank you for helping us maintain safety for everyone! Special NeedsIf you have a child with special needs, who may need additional assistance for morning and/or afternoon carpool please contact Vanessa Baker vbaker@socratesacademy.us or 704.321.1711 X175​Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyJEANS DAY PAYMENT | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreJEANS DAY PAYMENTContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyHYBRID INSTRUCTION | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreHYBRID MODEL INSTRUCTIONThe dates above show the WEEK the scholars are attending, not the day.

Staff working the carpool line will enter the number into a tablet and the name will be displayed on a screen in the child’s classroom. You MUST have a new sign to go through carpool.​Tags can be picked up the week of October 26th Monday - Thursday9am - 10am Monday, Wednesday & Thursday1:30pm - 2:30pm. Tuesday, (Oct. 27th) Evening4:00pm - 6:00pm Pick up will be located behind the Middle School building. Kindergarten may pick up signs and drop off supplies during their practice session. Kindergarten students who are not attending the practice session will need to come during pick up hours. ​Supply Drop OffWe are asking families to drop off supplies when they pick up their carpool tags. You Homeroom teacher will communicate what supplies are needed at this time. Please label all bags or boxes with your child's homeroom teacher. Remote families do not need to send in supplies.​Masks & Temperature ChecksPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.  You will be asked three questions by a staff member: Has your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?Does your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?Does your child have Co vid 19?​If you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.​No Walkers - Morning or AfternoonIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY. Late Pick-UpsStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park, call the office and walk to the doors, where the student will be waiting. After 3 late pick ups, students will be asked to move to Remote Instruction.HYBRID CALENDAR DOWNLOADBRING YOUR OWN DEVICE AGREEMENTREOPENING TRANSITION PLANMOVE TO REMOTEHYBRID PLAN PARENT HANDBOOKFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSASK A QUESTIONPROCEDURE VIDEOS​​Social Distance Tour >> Wear a Mask >>Ducks in a Row - Campus Walks >>Recess Before/After Procedures >>Arrive to Classroom in Morning >> Feeling Sick Procedure >>​Morning Carpool >>​Afternoon Carpool >>ELEMENTARYBELL SCHEDULE ARRIVAL:   7:45am - 8:10amTARDY AFTER:   8:10am​How to Sign In a Tardy StudentStudents who are tardy will need to be checked in by a parent in the Middle School Foyer.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school.

Its mission is to act as the fundraising arm of the Socrates Academy. All programs, projects and activities funded through the Foundation shall be used to enhance the Academy's educational programs and will be in alignment with its strategic plan, mission statement, goals, and budget considerations. Foundation MembersGretchen CarsonPresident​gcarson@socratesacademy.us Larry PeroulasMember​larry_peroulas@hotmail.comAntonis Stylianou, Ph.D.Member​astylianou@uncc.eduSocrates Foundation Frequently Asked Questions​Why does Socrates Academy need to raise funds? Isn't it a public school?Socrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.  Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.  Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves. ​What is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?Annual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for "brick and mortar type projects".  North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing. ​Are we seeking support from outside the school community?External support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is "What have you been able to raise internally?"  It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community. ​How will my funds be used?Donations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school’s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility. ​What is a Matching Gift Program?When a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization. For example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!Click here to see a list of companies we know that DO have Matching Gift programs Contact UsIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:foundation@socratesacademy.us Socrates Academy Foundation3909 Weddington RoadMatthews, NC 28105704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ANNUAL FUND DONATION | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreANNUAL FUND DONATION FORMContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyRECURRING CAPITAL CAMPAIGN DONATION | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreRECURRING CAPITAL CAMPAIGN DONATION Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyRECURRING ANNUAL FUND DONATION | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreRECURRING ANNUAL FUND DONATIONContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyPARENTS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMorePARENTSFrom the Socrates Mission Statement: "The mission of the Socrates Academy is to work in partnership with parents and community to encourage our students to reach their full potential..." That partnership with parents lies at the heart of everything we do. From the moment your child's name is drawn in the enrollment lottery, Socrates Academy provides an exceptional range of opportunities for you to engage with their learning experience. We offer opportunities for HomeBase Parents to assist in the classroom. Beyond the classroom, parents can engage with school clubs to share a love of chess, journalism, or their personal area of expertise. Our commitment to keeping parents fully informed and engaged is reflected in this website. Here you will find information on past and upcoming events, teacher pages with updates on the latest happenings in the classroom and the extended learning that our scholars bring home, and contact information for your child's teachers. The school site includes printable forms, links to hot lunch ordering, up-to-date information on school procedures, and timely updates on school closures. In a partnership, the flow of information goes both ways and we value parent input as an integral component of our ongoing development. Through the PFI and regular Town Hall meetings, we invite you to play an active role in defining the future direction of the Socrates Academy community. We are thrilled that you and your children have joined the Socrates Academy community. We look forward to providing you with the very best that we have to offer and to everything that your family's involvement will bring to the school!Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ABSENTEE REPORTING FORM | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreABSENTEE REPORTING FORMContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyOUR ANNUAL FUND | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreOUR ANNUAL FUNDThe Invest in a Scholar Annual Fund Campaign is our primary opportunity for school families to participate in the continued success of the Academy by helping to bridge the gap left by state and local funding. Families are invited to donate to the school to support existing educational programs, develop new curriculum, improve school facilities, and support essential needs of Socrates Academy. The money raised through the Invest in a Scholar program will support exclusively the operational needs of the school and will not be used for any additional land purchases or new buildings being considered by the Board of Directors.WHY SUPPORT THE ANNUAL FUND?DONATE TO THE ANNUAL FUNDSET UP A RECURRING DONATIONThese Fundraisers BenefitOur Annual Fund, too!Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations: ​ 1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success – Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books – A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers. LEARN MOREContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyNEWSLETTER ARCHIVE | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreTHE SOCRATES CONNECTIONNewsletter ArchiveNovember 2, 2020October 28, 2020October 22, 2020October 15, 2020October 8, 2020October 1, 2020 September 24, 20September 17, 2020September 10, 2020September 3, 2020​August 27, 2020August 20, 2020Back to School BlastBitmoji Open HouseAugust 13, 2020August 7, 2020 ​July 31, 2020July 24, 2020STAY IN TOUCHBe in the know!Subscribe to the Socrates ConnectionSubscribe to us on YouTubeFind us onlineContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyATHLETICS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreATHLETICSA Message from Our Athletic DirectorCross CountryNO TRYOUT - OPEN TO ALLMIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTSSEASON: August - NovemberCheerTRYOUTS - OCTOBERSEASON: October - FebruaryGirl's BasketballTRYOUTS - DECEMBERSEASON: January - AprilSocrates Academy emphasizes the importance that interscholastic team sports plays in the lives of our students.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyMulti Purpose RoomOur cafeteria doubles as an auditorium.

An alternative to bringing lunch is to order from our Hot Lunch Menu. Hot Lunch is prepared off site and brought in to the scholars and must be ordered 2-4 weeks in advance. Learn more about Hot Lunch HERE. Students walk from their classroom to lunch each day with their class and eat in the cafeteria with their teacher. Students are not permitted to share food. Students are not permitted to bring soda in their lunches. Students may not be pulled from class during instruction to have lunch with a sibling unless their lunch schedule is the same. The Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct applies to all student actions during lunch Socrates Academy provides a table in the cafeteria that is to be kept free of the type of allergen(s) that impact theidentified student(s). While this table is available to the identified student(s), they are not be required to eat only at this table. Snacks may be purchased from the Hot Lunch counter with cash only. Items for purchase include, but are not limited to, chips, drinks, muffins and fruit.FORGOTTEN LUNCHESForgotten lunches should be brought to the Middle School building and placed on the stage. Students are taught to check the stage for their lunch before calling home. If a student has forgotten their lunch and a parent is unable to be reached, they are able to buy lunch with credit from the Hot Lunch counter. The student will need to bring cash money for payment the next day.VISITING DURING LUNCHAny family members visiting during lunch, must sign in with a license at either office. Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom.  We ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch.​If a parent wishes to send in a treat for their child’s birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school.

If you are coming from Antioch Church Road, we encourage you to turn right into the lower parking lot (entrance near the Couchell Building). 	 Do not stop in front of a building. Proceed to the front of the line when dropping off your scholars.	 There is NO passing in carpool line. ​Tardy ScholarsElementary scholars who arrive in the lot after 8:10am are considered tardy. Secondary School scholars who arrive after 8:00am,are considered tardy. 	 Parents must sign their children in at the front office (Elementary scholars get signed in at the Couchell Building, and Secondary School scholars get signed in at the Secondary School building) to get a tardy slip.​Dismissal Procedures Cars may not line up in either parking lot before 3:00 pm.​​Carpool SignsCarpool signs should be placed in the dashboard window and kept in the window until you leave the parking lot. If a carpool sign is not present, the car will be pulled to the side, driver ID checked, and driver verified as an authorized driver on the carpool form with the office staff.	 Please keep your carpool sign from year to year, unless there is a change that needs to be made to the sign. It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. ​​Afternoon Carpool (6-8 Students)All cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. 	 If your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area.	 Begins at 3:30 pm. Grades 6-8 are dismissed from the upper parking lot. Parents will enter through the entrance between the painted rocks and will exit via Simfield Church Road.​Afternoon Carpool (K-5 Students)Begins at 3:30pm. Grades 4 and 5 are dismissed from the upper parking lot (with and without siblings). 	 Grades K-3 are dismissed from the lower lot (only if they do not have 4th-8th grade siblings).	 All students will go to the classroom of their older sibling for carpool. This includes K-3 students that have siblings in Middle School. 	 K-3 students with Middle School siblings, will not come into the Middle School, but will be supervised in the 4th and 5th Grade building. They will be called at the same time that their Middle School Sibling is called. The siblings will meet at the carpool zone.  There are NO left turns out of the school parking lots between the hours of 3:15pm-4:15pm. Cars must be in the parking lot before 3:55pm. If you arrive after carpool has ended, your student will be sent to Afterschool. There is a $1.00 per minute charge up to a maximum of $20.00 for this service.​​ ​General Guidelines WalkersScholars who walk must live within one mile of the school, and parents must complete a form to be approved by the administration.	 If a parent is driving a car to pick up a walker, then he or she must go through the carpool line.	 Elementary walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet in front of the Elementary Building.	 Middle School walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet at the roundabout near the Secondary School.​​Church Next DoorWe are NOT using the church next door for parking or carpool. Parents who park at the church do so at their own risk and may be towed. Parents are not to wait in the church parking lot until it is 3:00pm, when you are permitted to enter our lot for elementary dismissal.​​Cell PhonesCell phone use is prohibited to ensure that everyone is focused on keeping our scholars safe. Thank you for helping us maintain safety for everyone! Special NeedsIf you have a child with special needs, who may need additional assistance for morning and/or afternoon carpool please contact Vanessa Baker vbaker@socratesacademy.us or 704.321.1711 X175​Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyHYBRID INSTRUCTION | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreHYBRID MODEL INSTRUCTIONThe dates above show the WEEK the scholars are attending, not the day.

Staff working the carpool line will enter the number into a tablet and the name will be displayed on a screen in the child’s classroom. You MUST have a new sign to go through carpool.​Tags can be picked up the week of October 26th Monday - Thursday9am - 10am Monday, Wednesday & Thursday1:30pm - 2:30pm. Tuesday, (Oct. 27th) Evening4:00pm - 6:00pm Pick up will be located behind the Middle School building. Kindergarten may pick up signs and drop off supplies during their practice session. Kindergarten students who are not attending the practice session will need to come during pick up hours. ​Supply Drop OffWe are asking families to drop off supplies when they pick up their carpool tags. You Homeroom teacher will communicate what supplies are needed at this time. Please label all bags or boxes with your child's homeroom teacher. Remote families do not need to send in supplies.​Masks & Temperature ChecksPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.  You will be asked three questions by a staff member: Has your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?Does your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?Does your child have Co vid 19?​If you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.​No Walkers - Morning or AfternoonIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY. Late Pick-UpsStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park, call the office and walk to the doors, where the student will be waiting. After 3 late pick ups, students will be asked to move to Remote Instruction.HYBRID CALENDAR DOWNLOADBRING YOUR OWN DEVICE AGREEMENTREOPENING TRANSITION PLANMOVE TO REMOTEHYBRID PLAN PARENT HANDBOOKFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSASK A QUESTIONPROCEDURE VIDEOS​​Social Distance Tour >> Wear a Mask >>Ducks in a Row - Campus Walks >>Recess Before/After Procedures >>Arrive to Classroom in Morning >> Feeling Sick Procedure >>​Morning Carpool >>​Afternoon Carpool >>ELEMENTARYBELL SCHEDULE ARRIVAL:   7:45am - 8:10amTARDY AFTER:   8:10am​How to Sign In a Tardy StudentStudents who are tardy will need to be checked in by a parent in the Middle School Foyer.

Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.​Our Core ValuesOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:• Filotimo (Greek: Φιλότιμο): Αlmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.• Arete (Greek: Αρετή): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.• Philoxenia (Greek: Φιλοξενία): eagerness to show hospitality• Ethos (Greek: Ηθος): Ethical Behavior• Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.• Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.• Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice• Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example• Strive for Excellence (Greek: Αιέν αριστεύειν): Setting goals and always striving to do one’s best and seeking continuous improvement​​The Socrates ApproachThe Academy’s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.  What is the Socratic Method?Definition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition. The Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights. The Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.  This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education. Want to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom? Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSEGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence. We look forward to watching our children flourish in their remaining years at Socrates, and feel confident that they will be well-prepared for the next big transition into high school."​- Mary Beth A., Socrates ParentContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy CALENDAR | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreSOCRATES CALENDARDOWNLOAD THE 2020-2021 CALENDARDOWNLOAD THE 2019-2020 CALENDARADD THE SOCRATES CALENDAR TO YOURSSOCRATES TESTING CALENDARTo add the Socrates Calendar to your personal Google Calendar​1.

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us ​What happens if I don't volunteer?Our volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have​ if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school. ​Why do I have to volunteer?North Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools. Charter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.Charter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities. In order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.​How many hours do I have to complete?36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.​ What constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?A volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.  Examples include: Participating in Committee workAttending Town Hall meetings or Board MeetingsPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetingsWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)Working a special eventFulfilling duties for committees	 What does not constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?Eating lunch with your scholarAttending parent/teacher conferences Can other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?We love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.​Can I donate my hours?Yes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together. ​How will my hours be tracked?Use the volunteer log on the website to track your hours. You are now unable to search your hours online. We are looking at solutions, but for now, please make sure your email address is correct when you log your hours, because totals will be sent there. Please use the same email address each time you fill out the volunteer log.​​  Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyEXIT SURVEY | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreWITHDRAWAL FORM & EXIT SURVEYContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademySUPPLY LISTS2 | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMore2020-2021 SUPPLY LISTSKindergarten Supply List First Grade Supply List Second Grade Supply List Third Grade Supply List Fourth Grade Supply List Fifth Grade Supply List​Living & Learning Classroom (by assignment only)  MIDDLE SCHOOL6th Grade: Please purchase supplies based on your students first elective choices.

After that time, we request that parents use carpool. We will have additional staff and volunteers the first weeks of school so that Kindergarten students are able to find their way to their classrooms.​Can I walk in to pick up my child?All students must be picked up through carpool line. Parents are not permitted to walk in and remove students.​Is there snack?Yes. All students are permitted to have snack at different times.

Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time.

From the moment your child's name is drawn in the enrollment lottery, Socrates Academy provides an exceptional range of opportunities for you to engage with their learning experience. We offer opportunities for HomeBase Parents to assist in the classroom. Beyond the classroom, parents can engage with school clubs to share a love of chess, journalism, or their personal area of expertise. Our commitment to keeping parents fully informed and engaged is reflected in this website. Here you will find information on past and upcoming events, teacher pages with updates on the latest happenings in the classroom and the extended learning that our scholars bring home, and contact information for your child's teachers. The school site includes printable forms, links to hot lunch ordering, up-to-date information on school procedures, and timely updates on school closures. In a partnership, the flow of information goes both ways and we value parent input as an integral component of our ongoing development. Through the PFI and regular Town Hall meetings, we invite you to play an active role in defining the future direction of the Socrates Academy community. We are thrilled that you and your children have joined the Socrates Academy community. We look forward to providing you with the very best that we have to offer and to everything that your family's involvement will bring to the school!Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ADMISSIONS | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreADMISSIONSPlease read the Frequently Asked Questions before calling the school to inquire about the lottery process. ​Information about the school can also be found on the website under the Our School or you can join us for a tour or take a virtual tour.​ ​2021-2022STUDENT APPLICATIONAPPLICATIONS WILL GO LIVE ON NOVEMBER 5, 2020STUDENT APPLICATIONThe sibling application is ONLY for siblings of students who are currently attending school at Socrates Academy.SIBLING APPLICATIONTop of PageImportant Lottery DatesVisit SocratesFrequently Asked QuestionsREGISTRARRecords, transcripts & admissions information​Georgia Kastanasgkastanas@socratesacademy.us ​704-321-1711 x100Fax: 704-321-1714Apply to Socrates Academy​You may still apply for the current school year until December 15th but you will be added to the end of the wait list for the current year if there are no spots available. (Please Note: Proof of North Carolina residency will be required if you are accepted into Socrates Academy through the lottery process)​Socrates Academy is a North Carolina Public Charter School and to be eligible to attend you must be a legal resident of North Carolina.

Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.​Our Core ValuesOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:• Filotimo (Greek: Φιλότιμο): Αlmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.• Arete (Greek: Αρετή): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.• Philoxenia (Greek: Φιλοξενία): eagerness to show hospitality• Ethos (Greek: Ηθος): Ethical Behavior• Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.• Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.• Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice• Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example• Strive for Excellence (Greek: Αιέν αριστεύειν): Setting goals and always striving to do one’s best and seeking continuous improvement​​The Socrates ApproachThe Academy’s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.  What is the Socratic Method?Definition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition. The Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights. The Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.  This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education. Want to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom? Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSEGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence. We look forward to watching our children flourish in their remaining years at Socrates, and feel confident that they will be well-prepared for the next big transition into high school."​- Mary Beth A., Socrates ParentContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ADMISSIONS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreADMISSIONSPlease read the Frequently Asked Questions before calling the school to inquire about the lottery process. ​Information about the school can also be found on the website under the Our School or you can join us for a tour or take a virtual tour.​ ​2021-2022STUDENT APPLICATIONAPPLICATIONS WILL GO LIVE ON NOVEMBER 5, 2020STUDENT APPLICATIONThe sibling application is ONLY for siblings of students who are currently attending school at Socrates Academy.SIBLING APPLICATIONTop of PageImportant Lottery DatesVisit SocratesFrequently Asked QuestionsREGISTRARRecords, transcripts & admissions information​Georgia Kastanasgkastanas@socratesacademy.us ​704-321-1711 x100Fax: 704-321-1714Apply to Socrates Academy​You may still apply for the current school year until December 15th but you will be added to the end of the wait list for the current year if there are no spots available. (Please Note: Proof of North Carolina residency will be required if you are accepted into Socrates Academy through the lottery process)​Socrates Academy is a North Carolina Public Charter School and to be eligible to attend you must be a legal resident of North Carolina.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy VOLUNTEERING | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreVOLUNTEERINGMANAGE YOUR HOURSLOG YOUR VOLUNTEER HOURSTop of PageVolunteer OpportunitiesVolunteering FAQVOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIESComplete Volunteer Interest FormEnjoy the Outdoors?Help with the gardens, outdoor classroom ~ socratespfi@gmail.comOutdoor Beautification ~ socratespfi@gmail.comCome to our Weekend Workdays ~ Check the Connection​Want to donate from home?Consider sending an item from our Wishlist​​Like to Cook?Bake snacks for the teacher's lounges ~ socratespfi@gmail.comCheck the Connection for ways to donate Love to Serve Others?​Hot Lunch would love your help ~ dingram@socratesacademy.usVolunteer at the Front Desk ~ Check the Connection for sign upsJoin the Gratitude Team ~ jsoucey@socratesacademy.us Enjoy Sports and Athletic Events?Coach a Team ~ mpearl@socratesacademy.usHelp with Athletics ~ mpearl@socratesacademy.usHelp out with March Madness ~ mpearl@socratesacademy.usWork concessions during games ~ mpearl@socratesacademy.usJoin the Owl Club (Athletics Fundraising) ~ mpearl@socratesacademy.usHelp with the 5K ~ jsoucey@socratesacademy.usVolunteer with Field Day or PE ~ lstewart@socratesacademy.us Are you Artsy?Come give the kids an art demo! ~ kpoimboeuf@socratesacademy.usHelp in the art room ~ kpoimboeuf@socratesacademy.usHelp with night of the arts ~ kballard@socratesacademy.usBuild sets for drama ~ kballard@socratesacademy.usDecorate the school for each season ~ socratespfi@gmail.comDecorate the stage for performances ~ kballard@socratesacademy.usDecorate the Multi-Purpose Room for dances ~ willdite@aol.comDesign yearbook Ads (Photoshop experience required) ~ socratesyearbook@gmail.comDesign special event posters, flyers, and digital graphics ~ socratespfi@gmail.com Crafty?

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us ​What happens if I don't volunteer?Our volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have​ if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school. ​Why do I have to volunteer?North Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools. Charter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.Charter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities. In order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.​How many hours do I have to complete?36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.​ What constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?A volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.  Examples include: Participating in Committee workAttending Town Hall meetings or Board MeetingsPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetingsWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)Working a special eventFulfilling duties for committees	 What does not constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?Eating lunch with your scholarAttending parent/teacher conferences Can other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?We love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.​Can I donate my hours?Yes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together. ​How will my hours be tracked?Use the volunteer log on the website to track your hours. You are now unable to search your hours online. We are looking at solutions, but for now, please make sure your email address is correct when you log your hours, because totals will be sent there. Please use the same email address each time you fill out the volunteer log.​​  Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyUNIFORMS | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreUniform Closet HoursHours are posted in the Connection each week.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyMiddle School Greek ClassroomBoth Greek language and math in Greek, continue through the Middle School years.REMOTE INSTRUCTION | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreREMOTE INSTRUCTIONKINDERGARTEN - 2ND GRADEPrimary Instruction: Class DojoCommunication: Class DojoSocrates ConnectionEmailSocrates Academy Website (this)​​2ND - 8TH GRADE​Google ClassroomSet up your Students Email (Microsoft Outlook)Communication: Class DojoSocrates ConnectionEmailSocrates Academy Website (this)​TUTORIALS FOR PARENTS​Class Dojo PortfolioAsk Your Teacher a Question in Google ClassroomStudent Tour of Google ClassroomHow to use multiple Google accounts on one computerGoogle Drive OverviewGuardian's Guide to G Suite for EducationGoogle Tutorials for Parents & StudentsSeesaw for ParentsParents’ Ultimate Guide to Google ClassroomDistance Learning with Office365 for ParentsParents’ Ultimate Guide to ZoomClass dojo For ParentsParents Guide to ChromebooksPowerSchool Parent and Student Resource Center​FREE ONLINE LIBRARIES​Scholastic BooksThe Open LibraryRead PrintPublic BookshelfThe Literature Network​VIRTUAL TOURS ARTThe Washington, D.C.

Staff working the carpool line will enter the number into a tablet and the name will be displayed on a screen in the child’s classroom. You MUST have a new sign to go through carpool.​Tags can be picked up the week of October 26th Monday - Thursday9am - 10am Monday, Wednesday & Thursday1:30pm - 2:30pm. Tuesday, (Oct. 27th) Evening4:00pm - 6:00pm Pick up will be located behind the Middle School building. Kindergarten may pick up signs and drop off supplies during their practice session. Kindergarten students who are not attending the practice session will need to come during pick up hours. ​Supply Drop OffWe are asking families to drop off supplies when they pick up their carpool tags. You Homeroom teacher will communicate what supplies are needed at this time. Please label all bags or boxes with your child's homeroom teacher. Remote families do not need to send in supplies.​Masks & Temperature ChecksPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.  You will be asked three questions by a staff member: Has your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?Does your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?Does your child have Co vid 19?​If you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.​No Walkers - Morning or AfternoonIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY. Late Pick-UpsStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park, call the office and walk to the doors, where the student will be waiting. After 3 late pick ups, students will be asked to move to Remote Instruction.HYBRID CALENDAR DOWNLOADBRING YOUR OWN DEVICE AGREEMENTREOPENING TRANSITION PLANMOVE TO REMOTEHYBRID PLAN PARENT HANDBOOKFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSASK A QUESTIONPROCEDURE VIDEOS​​Social Distance Tour >> Wear a Mask >>Ducks in a Row - Campus Walks >>Recess Before/After Procedures >>Arrive to Classroom in Morning >> Feeling Sick Procedure >>​Morning Carpool >>​Afternoon Carpool >>ELEMENTARYBELL SCHEDULE ARRIVAL:   7:45am - 8:10amTARDY AFTER:   8:10am​How to Sign In a Tardy StudentStudents who are tardy will need to be checked in by a parent in the Middle School Foyer.

If you are coming from Antioch Church Road, we encourage you to turn right into the lower parking lot (entrance near the Couchell Building). 	 Do not stop in front of a building. Proceed to the front of the line when dropping off your scholars.	 There is NO passing in carpool line. ​Tardy ScholarsElementary scholars who arrive in the lot after 8:10am are considered tardy. Secondary School scholars who arrive after 8:00am,are considered tardy. 	 Parents must sign their children in at the front office (Elementary scholars get signed in at the Couchell Building, and Secondary School scholars get signed in at the Secondary School building) to get a tardy slip.​Dismissal Procedures Cars may not line up in either parking lot before 3:00 pm.​​Carpool SignsCarpool signs should be placed in the dashboard window and kept in the window until you leave the parking lot. If a carpool sign is not present, the car will be pulled to the side, driver ID checked, and driver verified as an authorized driver on the carpool form with the office staff.	 Please keep your carpool sign from year to year, unless there is a change that needs to be made to the sign. It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. ​​Afternoon Carpool (6-8 Students)All cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. 	 If your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area.	 Begins at 3:30 pm. Grades 6-8 are dismissed from the upper parking lot. Parents will enter through the entrance between the painted rocks and will exit via Simfield Church Road.​Afternoon Carpool (K-5 Students)Begins at 3:30pm. Grades 4 and 5 are dismissed from the upper parking lot (with and without siblings). 	 Grades K-3 are dismissed from the lower lot (only if they do not have 4th-8th grade siblings).	 All students will go to the classroom of their older sibling for carpool. This includes K-3 students that have siblings in Middle School. 	 K-3 students with Middle School siblings, will not come into the Middle School, but will be supervised in the 4th and 5th Grade building. They will be called at the same time that their Middle School Sibling is called. The siblings will meet at the carpool zone.  There are NO left turns out of the school parking lots between the hours of 3:15pm-4:15pm. Cars must be in the parking lot before 3:55pm. If you arrive after carpool has ended, your student will be sent to Afterschool. There is a $1.00 per minute charge up to a maximum of $20.00 for this service.​​ ​General Guidelines WalkersScholars who walk must live within one mile of the school, and parents must complete a form to be approved by the administration.	 If a parent is driving a car to pick up a walker, then he or she must go through the carpool line.	 Elementary walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet in front of the Elementary Building.	 Middle School walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet at the roundabout near the Secondary School.​​Church Next DoorWe are NOT using the church next door for parking or carpool. Parents who park at the church do so at their own risk and may be towed. Parents are not to wait in the church parking lot until it is 3:00pm, when you are permitted to enter our lot for elementary dismissal.​​Cell PhonesCell phone use is prohibited to ensure that everyone is focused on keeping our scholars safe. Thank you for helping us maintain safety for everyone! Special NeedsIf you have a child with special needs, who may need additional assistance for morning and/or afternoon carpool please contact Vanessa Baker vbaker@socratesacademy.us or 704.321.1711 X175​Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademySUPPORT SOCRATES | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreTHE SOCRATES ACADEMY FOUNDATIONThe Socrates Foundation MissionThe Socrates Academy Foundation is a non-profit 501 (c)(3), community organization founded in 2008 in order to support the Socrates Academy, Inc. charter school. Its mission is to act as the fundraising arm of the Socrates Academy. All programs, projects and activities funded through the Foundation shall be used to enhance the Academy's educational programs and will be in alignment with its strategic plan, mission statement, goals, and budget considerations. Foundation MembersGretchen CarsonPresident​gcarson@socratesacademy.us Larry PeroulasMember​larry_peroulas@hotmail.comAntonis Stylianou, Ph.D.Member​astylianou@uncc.eduSocrates Foundation Frequently Asked Questions​Why does Socrates Academy need to raise funds? Isn't it a public school?Socrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.  Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.  Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves. ​What is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?Annual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for "brick and mortar type projects".  North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing. ​Are we seeking support from outside the school community?External support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is "What have you been able to raise internally?"  It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community. ​How will my funds be used?Donations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school’s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility. ​What is a Matching Gift Program?When a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization. For example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!Click here to see a list of companies we know that DO have Matching Gift programs Contact UsIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:foundation@socratesacademy.us Socrates Academy Foundation3909 Weddington RoadMatthews, NC 28105704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ATHLETICS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreATHLETICSA Message from Our Athletic DirectorCross CountryNO TRYOUT - OPEN TO ALLMIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTSSEASON: August - NovemberCheerTRYOUTS - OCTOBERSEASON: October - FebruaryGirl's BasketballTRYOUTS - DECEMBERSEASON: January - AprilSocrates Academy emphasizes the importance that interscholastic team sports plays in the lives of our students.

Families are invited to donate to the school to support existing educational programs, develop new curriculum, improve school facilities, and support essential needs of Socrates Academy. The money raised through the Invest in a Scholar program will support exclusively the operational needs of the school and will not be used for any additional land purchases or new buildings being considered by the Board of Directors.WHY SUPPORT THE ANNUAL FUND?DONATE TO THE ANNUAL FUNDSET UP A RECURRING DONATIONThese Fundraisers BenefitOur Annual Fund, too!Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations: ​ 1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success – Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books – A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers. LEARN MOREContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyABSENTEE REPORTING FORM | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreABSENTEE REPORTING FORMContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyLUNCH | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreLUNCHORDER HOT LUNCHCREATE AN ACCOUNTHot lunch ordering is available for the upcoming month from the 1st - 15th of the current month.LUNCH TIMES​​KINDERGARTEN    10:00 to 10:253RD GRADE    10:40 to 11:056TH GRADE    10:52 to 11:227TH GRADE    11:23 to 11:538TH GRADE    11:23 to 11:531ST GRADE    12:05 to 12:304TH GRADE    12:20 to12:452ND GRADE    12:35 to 1:005TH GRADE    1:05 to 1:30ROUTINES & RULESSocrates Academy does not have a traditional cafeteria program so lunches must be brought from home.

Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom.  We ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch.​If a parent wishes to send in a treat for their child’s birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyMulti Purpose RoomOur cafeteria doubles as an auditorium.

Scholars consistently participate in Socratic Seminars and are challenged to think critically.Science &Social StudiesElementary Students have science and social studies for a semester each. This class is called Integrated Units. These classes follow the NC DPI Standards as a basis for instruction.​Middle School Students have science and social students for a semester each. These classes follow the NC DPI Standards as a basis for instruction.WritingElementary Students learn a balanced literacy approach to writing. We use research-based sources to teach our scholars because we know they work. ​Middle School Students Middle school scholars write expository, narrative and persuasive essays. Scholars conduct a series of edits, receiving feedback from peers and teachers.GreekElementary Students attend 50 minutes of Greek Language and 50 minutes of Greek Math each day. K-2nd Greek Math is co-taught with the Greek & Homeroom teachers. Middle School Students attend 54 minutes of Greek Language and 54 minutes of Greek Math each day. Greek Language and Greek Math classes are leveled starting in 5th grade. ​New Students in 5th - 8th grade are started in beginner Greek classes. Elementary students learn using differentiated instruction.Why Greek? >>MathematicsElementary Students are taught Math using the Singapore method twice daily. Once in English and once in Greek.​Middle School Students are offered Math through High School Math II.

Families are invited to donate to the school to support existing educational programs, develop new curriculum, improve school facilities, and support essential needs of Socrates Academy. The money raised through the Invest in a Scholar program will support exclusively the operational needs of the school and will not be used for any additional land purchases or new buildings being considered by the Board of Directors.WHY SUPPORT THE ANNUAL FUND?DONATE TO THE ANNUAL FUNDSET UP A RECURRING DONATIONThese Fundraisers BenefitOur Annual Fund, too!Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations: ​ 1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success – Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books – A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers. LEARN MOREContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyADMISSIONS | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreADMISSIONSPlease read the Frequently Asked Questions before calling the school to inquire about the lottery process. ​Information about the school can also be found on the website under the Our School or you can join us for a tour or take a virtual tour.​ ​2021-2022STUDENT APPLICATIONAPPLICATIONS WILL GO LIVE ON NOVEMBER 5, 2020STUDENT APPLICATIONThe sibling application is ONLY for siblings of students who are currently attending school at Socrates Academy.SIBLING APPLICATIONTop of PageImportant Lottery DatesVisit SocratesFrequently Asked QuestionsREGISTRARRecords, transcripts & admissions information​Georgia Kastanasgkastanas@socratesacademy.us ​704-321-1711 x100Fax: 704-321-1714Apply to Socrates Academy​You may still apply for the current school year until December 15th but you will be added to the end of the wait list for the current year if there are no spots available. (Please Note: Proof of North Carolina residency will be required if you are accepted into Socrates Academy through the lottery process)​Socrates Academy is a North Carolina Public Charter School and to be eligible to attend you must be a legal resident of North Carolina.

Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.​Our Core ValuesOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:• Filotimo (Greek: Φιλότιμο): Αlmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.• Arete (Greek: Αρετή): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.• Philoxenia (Greek: Φιλοξενία): eagerness to show hospitality• Ethos (Greek: Ηθος): Ethical Behavior• Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.• Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.• Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice• Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example• Strive for Excellence (Greek: Αιέν αριστεύειν): Setting goals and always striving to do one’s best and seeking continuous improvement​​The Socrates ApproachThe Academy’s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.  What is the Socratic Method?Definition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition. The Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights. The Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.  This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education. Want to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom? Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSEGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence. We look forward to watching our children flourish in their remaining years at Socrates, and feel confident that they will be well-prepared for the next big transition into high school."​- Mary Beth A., Socrates ParentContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy FORMS & PAYMENTS | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreFORMS & PAYMENTSMAKE A PAYMENT​UNIFORM CLOSET ORDER FORMPAY FOR EDUCATIONAL EXPENSESPAY FOR JEANS DAYPAY FOR AFTER HOURS PROGRAMSPAY FOR ATHLETICS ORDER MIDDLE SCHOOL PE UNIFORMS ORDER ELEMENTARY PE UNIFORMSORDER SPIRIT WEARBullying: Parent Report Form - (Elementary Only)​Beginning of the Year Forms​Absentee Reporting Form​Student Placement Form​New Student Health Assessment Form School Rock (pdf) Withdrawal Form Field Trip Chaperone Form Background Check Form (for chaperones)The background check form requires a fee of $22.00 which must be paid by the person that is submitting the form.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ORDER SPIRIT WEAR | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreSPIRIT WEAR ORDER FORMContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyPARENTS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMorePARENTSFrom the Socrates Mission Statement: "The mission of the Socrates Academy is to work in partnership with parents and community to encourage our students to reach their full potential..." That partnership with parents lies at the heart of everything we do. From the moment your child's name is drawn in the enrollment lottery, Socrates Academy provides an exceptional range of opportunities for you to engage with their learning experience. We offer opportunities for HomeBase Parents to assist in the classroom. Beyond the classroom, parents can engage with school clubs to share a love of chess, journalism, or their personal area of expertise. Our commitment to keeping parents fully informed and engaged is reflected in this website. Here you will find information on past and upcoming events, teacher pages with updates on the latest happenings in the classroom and the extended learning that our scholars bring home, and contact information for your child's teachers. The school site includes printable forms, links to hot lunch ordering, up-to-date information on school procedures, and timely updates on school closures. In a partnership, the flow of information goes both ways and we value parent input as an integral component of our ongoing development. Through the PFI and regular Town Hall meetings, we invite you to play an active role in defining the future direction of the Socrates Academy community. We are thrilled that you and your children have joined the Socrates Academy community. We look forward to providing you with the very best that we have to offer and to everything that your family's involvement will bring to the school!Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ABSENTEE REPORTING FORM | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreABSENTEE REPORTING FORMContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyCARPOOL | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreCARPOOLCARPOOL FORMSPRINT A CARPOOL SIGNFIND A CARPOOLPlease send an email with ALL of the below information to socratescarpool@gmail.com You will receive a map and contact information so that you can coordinate with other families.  Parents Name:Cell:Email Address:Physical Address including zip:Lines (Lower or Upper)Students Age and Grade​Any special requests:Do you want carpool in morning, afternoon, or both?​Select 1:I'm willing to drive and have space for (insert number) passengers in the (insert morning, afternoon, or both)ORI wish to have assistance and contribute towards gas expensesArrival Procedures​Morning Carpool General Guidelines Students must be in the building by 8:10 (Elementary) and 8:00 (Middle School) or they will be considered tardy. 	 There are NO left turns out of the school parking lots onto Weddington Road between the hours of 7:45 am-8:15 am. 	 ALL scholars must come through the carpool line. 	 Secondary school parents may drop off scholars from 7:45am-8:00am.	 Elementary scholars may be dropped off in either parking lot. 	 If you are coming from the McKee Road, we strongly encourage you to turn left into the upper parking lot (entrance between the painted rocks) in order to prevent back-ups on Weddington Road. If you are coming from Antioch Church Road, we encourage you to turn right into the lower parking lot (entrance near the Couchell Building). 	 Do not stop in front of a building. Proceed to the front of the line when dropping off your scholars.	 There is NO passing in carpool line. ​Tardy ScholarsElementary scholars who arrive in the lot after 8:10am are considered tardy. Secondary School scholars who arrive after 8:00am,are considered tardy. 	 Parents must sign their children in at the front office (Elementary scholars get signed in at the Couchell Building, and Secondary School scholars get signed in at the Secondary School building) to get a tardy slip.​Dismissal Procedures Cars may not line up in either parking lot before 3:00 pm.​​Carpool SignsCarpool signs should be placed in the dashboard window and kept in the window until you leave the parking lot. If a carpool sign is not present, the car will be pulled to the side, driver ID checked, and driver verified as an authorized driver on the carpool form with the office staff.	 Please keep your carpool sign from year to year, unless there is a change that needs to be made to the sign. It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. ​​Afternoon Carpool (6-8 Students)All cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. 	 If your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area.	 Begins at 3:30 pm. Grades 6-8 are dismissed from the upper parking lot. Parents will enter through the entrance between the painted rocks and will exit via Simfield Church Road.​Afternoon Carpool (K-5 Students)Begins at 3:30pm. Grades 4 and 5 are dismissed from the upper parking lot (with and without siblings). 	 Grades K-3 are dismissed from the lower lot (only if they do not have 4th-8th grade siblings).	 All students will go to the classroom of their older sibling for carpool. This includes K-3 students that have siblings in Middle School. 	 K-3 students with Middle School siblings, will not come into the Middle School, but will be supervised in the 4th and 5th Grade building. They will be called at the same time that their Middle School Sibling is called. The siblings will meet at the carpool zone.  There are NO left turns out of the school parking lots between the hours of 3:15pm-4:15pm. Cars must be in the parking lot before 3:55pm. If you arrive after carpool has ended, your student will be sent to Afterschool. There is a $1.00 per minute charge up to a maximum of $20.00 for this service.​​ ​General Guidelines WalkersScholars who walk must live within one mile of the school, and parents must complete a form to be approved by the administration.	 If a parent is driving a car to pick up a walker, then he or she must go through the carpool line.	 Elementary walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet in front of the Elementary Building.	 Middle School walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet at the roundabout near the Secondary School.​​Church Next DoorWe are NOT using the church next door for parking or carpool. Parents who park at the church do so at their own risk and may be towed. Parents are not to wait in the church parking lot until it is 3:00pm, when you are permitted to enter our lot for elementary dismissal.​​Cell PhonesCell phone use is prohibited to ensure that everyone is focused on keeping our scholars safe. Thank you for helping us maintain safety for everyone! Special NeedsIf you have a child with special needs, who may need additional assistance for morning and/or afternoon carpool please contact Vanessa Baker vbaker@socratesacademy.us or 704.321.1711 X175​Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyATHLETICS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreATHLETICSA Message from Our Athletic DirectorCross CountryNO TRYOUT - OPEN TO ALLMIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTSSEASON: August - NovemberCheerTRYOUTS - OCTOBERSEASON: October - FebruaryGirl's BasketballTRYOUTS - DECEMBERSEASON: January - AprilSocrates Academy emphasizes the importance that interscholastic team sports plays in the lives of our students.

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us ​What happens if I don't volunteer?Our volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have​ if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school. ​Why do I have to volunteer?North Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools. Charter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.Charter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities. In order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.​How many hours do I have to complete?36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.​ What constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?A volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.  Examples include: Participating in Committee workAttending Town Hall meetings or Board MeetingsPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetingsWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)Working a special eventFulfilling duties for committees	 What does not constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?Eating lunch with your scholarAttending parent/teacher conferences Can other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?We love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.​Can I donate my hours?Yes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together. ​How will my hours be tracked?Use the volunteer log on the website to track your hours.

After that time, we request that parents use carpool. We will have additional staff and volunteers the first weeks of school so that Kindergarten students are able to find their way to their classrooms.​Can I walk in to pick up my child?All students must be picked up through carpool line. Parents are not permitted to walk in and remove students.​Is there snack?Yes. All students are permitted to have snack at different times. Snack times are based on the child's grade and schedule.​​Other Questions?

For example, K-2 students begin on November 3rd, NOT November 2nd.Carpool Tag Pick-up & Supply Drop OffFamilies will be given numbers instead of names for carpool this year. Staff working the carpool line will enter the number into a tablet and the name will be displayed on a screen in the child’s classroom. You MUST have a new sign to go through carpool.​Tags can be picked up the week of October 26th Monday - Thursday9am - 10am Monday, Wednesday & Thursday1:30pm - 2:30pm. Tuesday, (Oct. 27th) Evening4:00pm - 6:00pm Pick up will be located behind the Middle School building. Kindergarten may pick up signs and drop off supplies during their practice session. Kindergarten students who are not attending the practice session will need to come during pick up hours. ​Supply Drop OffWe are asking families to drop off supplies when they pick up their carpool tags. You Homeroom teacher will communicate what supplies are needed at this time. Please label all bags or boxes with your child's homeroom teacher. Remote families do not need to send in supplies.​Masks & Temperature ChecksPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.  You will be asked three questions by a staff member: Has your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?Does your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?Does your child have Co vid 19?​If you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.​No Walkers - Morning or AfternoonIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY. Late Pick-UpsStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park, call the office and walk to the doors, where the student will be waiting. After 3 late pick ups, students will be asked to move to Remote Instruction.HYBRID CALENDAR DOWNLOADBRING YOUR OWN DEVICE AGREEMENTREOPENING TRANSITION PLANMOVE TO REMOTEHYBRID PLAN PARENT HANDBOOKFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSASK A QUESTIONPROCEDURE VIDEOS​​Social Distance Tour >> Wear a Mask >>Ducks in a Row - Campus Walks >>Recess Before/After Procedures >>Arrive to Classroom in Morning >> Feeling Sick Procedure >>​Morning Carpool >>​Afternoon Carpool >>ELEMENTARYBELL SCHEDULE ARRIVAL:   7:45am - 8:10amTARDY AFTER:   8:10am​How to Sign In a Tardy StudentStudents who are tardy will need to be checked in by a parent in the Middle School Foyer.

Its mission is to act as the fundraising arm of the Socrates Academy. All programs, projects and activities funded through the Foundation shall be used to enhance the Academy's educational programs and will be in alignment with its strategic plan, mission statement, goals, and budget considerations. Foundation MembersGretchen CarsonPresident​gcarson@socratesacademy.us Larry PeroulasMember​larry_peroulas@hotmail.comAntonis Stylianou, Ph.D.Member​astylianou@uncc.eduSocrates Foundation Frequently Asked Questions​Why does Socrates Academy need to raise funds? Isn't it a public school?Socrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.  Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.  Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves. ​What is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?Annual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for "brick and mortar type projects".  North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing. ​Are we seeking support from outside the school community?External support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is "What have you been able to raise internally?"  It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community. ​How will my funds be used?Donations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school’s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility. ​What is a Matching Gift Program?When a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization. For example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!Click here to see a list of companies we know that DO have Matching Gift programs Contact UsIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:foundation@socratesacademy.us Socrates Academy Foundation3909 Weddington RoadMatthews, NC 28105704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyREMOTE INSTRUCTION | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreREMOTE INSTRUCTIONKINDERGARTEN - 2ND GRADEPrimary Instruction: Class DojoCommunication: Class DojoSocrates ConnectionEmailSocrates Academy Website (this)​​2ND - 8TH GRADE​Google ClassroomSet up your Students Email (Microsoft Outlook)Communication: Class DojoSocrates ConnectionEmailSocrates Academy Website (this)​TUTORIALS FOR PARENTS​Class Dojo PortfolioAsk Your Teacher a Question in Google ClassroomStudent Tour of Google ClassroomHow to use multiple Google accounts on one computerGoogle Drive OverviewGuardian's Guide to G Suite for EducationGoogle Tutorials for Parents & StudentsSeesaw for ParentsParents’ Ultimate Guide to Google ClassroomDistance Learning with Office365 for ParentsParents’ Ultimate Guide to ZoomClass dojo For ParentsParents Guide to ChromebooksPowerSchool Parent and Student Resource Center​FREE ONLINE LIBRARIES​Scholastic BooksThe Open LibraryRead PrintPublic BookshelfThe Literature Network​VIRTUAL TOURS ARTThe Washington, D.C.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school.

From the moment your child's name is drawn in the enrollment lottery, Socrates Academy provides an exceptional range of opportunities for you to engage with their learning experience. We offer opportunities for HomeBase Parents to assist in the classroom. Beyond the classroom, parents can engage with school clubs to share a love of chess, journalism, or their personal area of expertise. Our commitment to keeping parents fully informed and engaged is reflected in this website. Here you will find information on past and upcoming events, teacher pages with updates on the latest happenings in the classroom and the extended learning that our scholars bring home, and contact information for your child's teachers. The school site includes printable forms, links to hot lunch ordering, up-to-date information on school procedures, and timely updates on school closures. In a partnership, the flow of information goes both ways and we value parent input as an integral component of our ongoing development. Through the PFI and regular Town Hall meetings, we invite you to play an active role in defining the future direction of the Socrates Academy community. We are thrilled that you and your children have joined the Socrates Academy community. We look forward to providing you with the very best that we have to offer and to everything that your family's involvement will bring to the school!Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy LOG VOLUNTEER HOURS | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreLOG VOLUNTEER HOURSPlease log hours in 30 minute increments.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school.

Scholars consistently participate in Socratic Seminars and are challenged to think critically.Science &Social StudiesElementary Students have science and social studies for a semester each. This class is called Integrated Units. These classes follow the NC DPI Standards as a basis for instruction.​Middle School Students have science and social students for a semester each. These classes follow the NC DPI Standards as a basis for instruction.WritingElementary Students learn a balanced literacy approach to writing. We use research-based sources to teach our scholars because we know they work. ​Middle School Students Middle school scholars write expository, narrative and persuasive essays. Scholars conduct a series of edits, receiving feedback from peers and teachers.GreekElementary Students attend 50 minutes of Greek Language and 50 minutes of Greek Math each day. K-2nd Greek Math is co-taught with the Greek & Homeroom teachers. Middle School Students attend 54 minutes of Greek Language and 54 minutes of Greek Math each day. Greek Language and Greek Math classes are leveled starting in 5th grade. ​New Students in 5th - 8th grade are started in beginner Greek classes. Elementary students learn using differentiated instruction.Why Greek? >>MathematicsElementary Students are taught Math using the Singapore method twice daily. Once in English and once in Greek.​Middle School Students are offered Math through High School Math II. Students learn math using the Socratic method to discover/explore concepts through questions and discussion.ElectivesElementary Students attend on special class daily.

Isn't it a public school?Socrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.  Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.  Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves. ​What is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?Annual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for "brick and mortar type projects".  North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing. ​Are we seeking support from outside the school community?External support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is "What have you been able to raise internally?"  It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community. ​How will my funds be used?Donations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school’s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility. ​What is a Matching Gift Program?When a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization. For example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!Click here to see a list of companies we know that DO have Matching Gift programs Contact UsIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:foundation@socratesacademy.us Socrates Academy Foundation3909 Weddington RoadMatthews, NC 28105704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyFORMS & PAYMENTS | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreFORMS & PAYMENTSMAKE A PAYMENT​UNIFORM CLOSET ORDER FORMPAY FOR EDUCATIONAL EXPENSESPAY FOR JEANS DAYPAY FOR AFTER HOURS PROGRAMSPAY FOR ATHLETICS ORDER MIDDLE SCHOOL PE UNIFORMS ORDER ELEMENTARY PE UNIFORMSORDER SPIRIT WEARBullying: Parent Report Form - (Elementary Only)​Beginning of the Year Forms​Absentee Reporting Form​Student Placement Form​New Student Health Assessment Form School Rock (pdf) Withdrawal Form Field Trip Chaperone Form Background Check Form (for chaperones)The background check form requires a fee of $22.00 which must be paid by the person that is submitting the form.

If you are coming from Antioch Church Road, we encourage you to turn right into the lower parking lot (entrance near the Couchell Building). 	 Do not stop in front of a building. Proceed to the front of the line when dropping off your scholars.	 There is NO passing in carpool line. ​Tardy ScholarsElementary scholars who arrive in the lot after 8:10am are considered tardy. Secondary School scholars who arrive after 8:00am,are considered tardy. 	 Parents must sign their children in at the front office (Elementary scholars get signed in at the Couchell Building, and Secondary School scholars get signed in at the Secondary School building) to get a tardy slip.​Dismissal Procedures Cars may not line up in either parking lot before 3:00 pm.​​Carpool SignsCarpool signs should be placed in the dashboard window and kept in the window until you leave the parking lot. If a carpool sign is not present, the car will be pulled to the side, driver ID checked, and driver verified as an authorized driver on the carpool form with the office staff.	 Please keep your carpool sign from year to year, unless there is a change that needs to be made to the sign. It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. ​​Afternoon Carpool (6-8 Students)All cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. 	 If your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area.	 Begins at 3:30 pm. Grades 6-8 are dismissed from the upper parking lot. Parents will enter through the entrance between the painted rocks and will exit via Simfield Church Road.​Afternoon Carpool (K-5 Students)Begins at 3:30pm. Grades 4 and 5 are dismissed from the upper parking lot (with and without siblings). 	 Grades K-3 are dismissed from the lower lot (only if they do not have 4th-8th grade siblings).	 All students will go to the classroom of their older sibling for carpool. This includes K-3 students that have siblings in Middle School. 	 K-3 students with Middle School siblings, will not come into the Middle School, but will be supervised in the 4th and 5th Grade building. They will be called at the same time that their Middle School Sibling is called. The siblings will meet at the carpool zone.  There are NO left turns out of the school parking lots between the hours of 3:15pm-4:15pm. Cars must be in the parking lot before 3:55pm. If you arrive after carpool has ended, your student will be sent to Afterschool. There is a $1.00 per minute charge up to a maximum of $20.00 for this service.​​ ​General Guidelines WalkersScholars who walk must live within one mile of the school, and parents must complete a form to be approved by the administration.	 If a parent is driving a car to pick up a walker, then he or she must go through the carpool line.	 Elementary walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet in front of the Elementary Building.	 Middle School walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet at the roundabout near the Secondary School.​​Church Next DoorWe are NOT using the church next door for parking or carpool. Parents who park at the church do so at their own risk and may be towed. Parents are not to wait in the church parking lot until it is 3:00pm, when you are permitted to enter our lot for elementary dismissal.​​Cell PhonesCell phone use is prohibited to ensure that everyone is focused on keeping our scholars safe. Thank you for helping us maintain safety for everyone! Special NeedsIf you have a child with special needs, who may need additional assistance for morning and/or afternoon carpool please contact Vanessa Baker vbaker@socratesacademy.us or 704.321.1711 X175​Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOL | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreOUR SCHOOL​​Our MissionThe mission of the Socrates Academy is to work in partnership with parents and community to encourage our students to reach their full potential by developing critical, analytical thinking skills and becoming self-confident in a high achieving, multicultural, disciplined environment. Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.​Our Core ValuesOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:• Filotimo (Greek: Φιλότιμο): Αlmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.• Arete (Greek: Αρετή): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.• Philoxenia (Greek: Φιλοξενία): eagerness to show hospitality• Ethos (Greek: Ηθος): Ethical Behavior• Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.• Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.• Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice• Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example• Strive for Excellence (Greek: Αιέν αριστεύειν): Setting goals and always striving to do one’s best and seeking continuous improvement​​The Socrates ApproachThe Academy’s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.  What is the Socratic Method?Definition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition. The Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights. The Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.  This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education. Want to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom? Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSEGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence. We look forward to watching our children flourish in their remaining years at Socrates, and feel confident that they will be well-prepared for the next big transition into high school."​- Mary Beth A., Socrates ParentContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy RECURRING ANNUAL FUND DONATION | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreRECURRING ANNUAL FUND DONATIONContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyATHLETICS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreATHLETICSA Message from Our Athletic DirectorCross CountryNO TRYOUT - OPEN TO ALLMIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTSSEASON: August - NovemberCheerTRYOUTS - OCTOBERSEASON: October - FebruaryGirl's BasketballTRYOUTS - DECEMBERSEASON: January - AprilSocrates Academy emphasizes the importance that interscholastic team sports plays in the lives of our students.

An alternative to bringing lunch is to order from our Hot Lunch Menu. Hot Lunch is prepared off site and brought in to the scholars and must be ordered 2-4 weeks in advance. Learn more about Hot Lunch HERE. Students walk from their classroom to lunch each day with their class and eat in the cafeteria with their teacher. Students are not permitted to share food. Students are not permitted to bring soda in their lunches. Students may not be pulled from class during instruction to have lunch with a sibling unless their lunch schedule is the same. The Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct applies to all student actions during lunch Socrates Academy provides a table in the cafeteria that is to be kept free of the type of allergen(s) that impact theidentified student(s). While this table is available to the identified student(s), they are not be required to eat only at this table. Snacks may be purchased from the Hot Lunch counter with cash only. Items for purchase include, but are not limited to, chips, drinks, muffins and fruit.FORGOTTEN LUNCHESForgotten lunches should be brought to the Middle School building and placed on the stage. Students are taught to check the stage for their lunch before calling home. If a student has forgotten their lunch and a parent is unable to be reached, they are able to buy lunch with credit from the Hot Lunch counter. The student will need to bring cash money for payment the next day.VISITING DURING LUNCHAny family members visiting during lunch, must sign in with a license at either office. Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom.  We ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch.​If a parent wishes to send in a treat for their child’s birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school. It is the policy of Socrates Academy that all food provided for consumption of our scholars must be commercially prepared, with the ingredient label visible. Our allergy management policy can be found HERE​Volunteers are needed to work behind the Hot Lunch counter and also in the main cafeteria area.

Families are invited to donate to the school to support existing educational programs, develop new curriculum, improve school facilities, and support essential needs of Socrates Academy. The money raised through the Invest in a Scholar program will support exclusively the operational needs of the school and will not be used for any additional land purchases or new buildings being considered by the Board of Directors.WHY SUPPORT THE ANNUAL FUND?DONATE TO THE ANNUAL FUNDSET UP A RECURRING DONATIONThese Fundraisers BenefitOur Annual Fund, too!Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations: ​ 1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success – Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books – A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers. LEARN MOREContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyORDER SPIRIT WEAR | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreSPIRIT WEAR ORDER FORMContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademySUPPLY LISTS2 | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMore2020-2021 SUPPLY LISTSKindergarten Supply List First Grade Supply List Second Grade Supply List Third Grade Supply List Fourth Grade Supply List Fifth Grade Supply List​Living & Learning Classroom (by assignment only)  MIDDLE SCHOOL6th Grade: Please purchase supplies based on your students first elective choices.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyArt is SmartFrom pottery to Picasso!

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us ​What happens if I don't volunteer?Our volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have​ if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school. ​Why do I have to volunteer?North Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools. Charter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.Charter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities. In order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.​How many hours do I have to complete?36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.​ What constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?A volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.  Examples include: Participating in Committee workAttending Town Hall meetings or Board MeetingsPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetingsWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)Working a special eventFulfilling duties for committees	 What does not constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?Eating lunch with your scholarAttending parent/teacher conferences Can other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?We love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.​Can I donate my hours?Yes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together. ​How will my hours be tracked?Use the volunteer log on the website to track your hours. You are now unable to search your hours online. We are looking at solutions, but for now, please make sure your email address is correct when you log your hours, because totals will be sent there. Please use the same email address each time you fill out the volunteer log.​​  Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyNEW FAMILIES | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreNEW FAMILIES​FIND A PARENT MENTOR​​If you are new to the school and would like some help learning your way, we would love to pair you with one of our New Parent Navigators!

After that time, we request that parents use carpool. We will have additional staff and volunteers the first weeks of school so that Kindergarten students are able to find their way to their classrooms.​Can I walk in to pick up my child?All students must be picked up through carpool line. Parents are not permitted to walk in and remove students.​Is there snack?Yes. All students are permitted to have snack at different times.

You Homeroom teacher will communicate what supplies are needed at this time. Please label all bags or boxes with your child's homeroom teacher. Remote families do not need to send in supplies.​Masks & Temperature ChecksPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.  You will be asked three questions by a staff member: Has your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?Does your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?Does your child have Co vid 19?​If you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.​No Walkers - Morning or AfternoonIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY. Late Pick-UpsStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park, call the office and walk to the doors, where the student will be waiting.

Isn't it a public school?Socrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.  Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.  Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves. ​What is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?Annual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for "brick and mortar type projects".  North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing. ​Are we seeking support from outside the school community?External support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is "What have you been able to raise internally?"  It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community. ​How will my funds be used?Donations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school’s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility. ​What is a Matching Gift Program?When a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization. For example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!Click here to see a list of companies we know that DO have Matching Gift programs Contact UsIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:foundation@socratesacademy.us Socrates Academy Foundation3909 Weddington RoadMatthews, NC 28105704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyCAREERS | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreCAREERSAPPLICATIONS& FORMSEmployment ApplicationSubstitute Teacher ApplicationReference FormOur Benefits Package Our Retirement Plan >>​Our Dental Package >> Our Vision Package >> Our 403 B Package >> Our Health Plan >>Now Hiring​If we do not have any vacancies you may select, "Employment Application" to submit your application, cover letter, and resume to careers@socratesacademy.us  ​​​Substitute Teachers >>​Middle School Teachers >>​Elementary Teachers >>​EC Teacher >>​Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyHOME | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreREPORT AN ABSENCELUNCHVOLUNTEERINGCALENDARNEW FAMILIESAPPLYANNOUNCEMENTSREMOTE & HYBRID INSTRUCTIONMore information about Hybrid Instruction can be found HERERemote Instruction information can be found HEREReturn to Remote Instruction Form​​NEW SCHOOL YEAR FORMSAll forms will be online this year.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyMulti Purpose RoomOur cafeteria doubles as an auditorium.

After that time, we request that parents use carpool.

If you are coming from Antioch Church Road, we encourage you to turn right into the lower parking lot (entrance near the Couchell Building). 	 Do not stop in front of a building. Proceed to the front of the line when dropping off your scholars.	 There is NO passing in carpool line. ​Tardy ScholarsElementary scholars who arrive in the lot after 8:10am are considered tardy. Secondary School scholars who arrive after 8:00am,are considered tardy. 	 Parents must sign their children in at the front office (Elementary scholars get signed in at the Couchell Building, and Secondary School scholars get signed in at the Secondary School building) to get a tardy slip.​Dismissal Procedures Cars may not line up in either parking lot before 3:00 pm.​​Carpool SignsCarpool signs should be placed in the dashboard window and kept in the window until you leave the parking lot. If a carpool sign is not present, the car will be pulled to the side, driver ID checked, and driver verified as an authorized driver on the carpool form with the office staff.	 Please keep your carpool sign from year to year, unless there is a change that needs to be made to the sign. It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. ​​Afternoon Carpool (6-8 Students)All cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. 	 If your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area.	 Begins at 3:30 pm. Grades 6-8 are dismissed from the upper parking lot. Parents will enter through the entrance between the painted rocks and will exit via Simfield Church Road.​Afternoon Carpool (K-5 Students)Begins at 3:30pm. Grades 4 and 5 are dismissed from the upper parking lot (with and without siblings). 	 Grades K-3 are dismissed from the lower lot (only if they do not have 4th-8th grade siblings).	 All students will go to the classroom of their older sibling for carpool. This includes K-3 students that have siblings in Middle School. 	 K-3 students with Middle School siblings, will not come into the Middle School, but will be supervised in the 4th and 5th Grade building. They will be called at the same time that their Middle School Sibling is called.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions​How does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.  If I’m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasn’t selected in this year’s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child’s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my child’s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I don’t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone  Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.​​ Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy OUR ANNUAL FUND | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreOUR ANNUAL FUNDThe Invest in a Scholar Annual Fund Campaign is our primary opportunity for school families to participate in the continued success of the Academy by helping to bridge the gap left by state and local funding. Families are invited to donate to the school to support existing educational programs, develop new curriculum, improve school facilities, and support essential needs of Socrates Academy. The money raised through the Invest in a Scholar program will support exclusively the operational needs of the school and will not be used for any additional land purchases or new buildings being considered by the Board of Directors.WHY SUPPORT THE ANNUAL FUND?DONATE TO THE ANNUAL FUNDSET UP A RECURRING DONATIONThese Fundraisers BenefitOur Annual Fund, too!Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations: ​ 1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success – Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books – A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers. LEARN MOREContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyLUNCH | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreLUNCHORDER HOT LUNCHCREATE AN ACCOUNTHot lunch ordering is available for the upcoming month from the 1st - 15th of the current month.LUNCH TIMES​​KINDERGARTEN    10:00 to 10:253RD GRADE    10:40 to 11:056TH GRADE    10:52 to 11:227TH GRADE    11:23 to 11:538TH GRADE    11:23 to 11:531ST GRADE    12:05 to 12:304TH GRADE    12:20 to12:452ND GRADE    12:35 to 1:005TH GRADE    1:05 to 1:30ROUTINES & RULESSocrates Academy does not have a traditional cafeteria program so lunches must be brought from home. An alternative to bringing lunch is to order from our Hot Lunch Menu. Hot Lunch is prepared off site and brought in to the scholars and must be ordered 2-4 weeks in advance. Learn more about Hot Lunch HERE. Students walk from their classroom to lunch each day with their class and eat in the cafeteria with their teacher. Students are not permitted to share food. Students are not permitted to bring soda in their lunches. Students may not be pulled from class during instruction to have lunch with a sibling unless their lunch schedule is the same. The Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct applies to all student actions during lunch Socrates Academy provides a table in the cafeteria that is to be kept free of the type of allergen(s) that impact theidentified student(s). While this table is available to the identified student(s), they are not be required to eat only at this table. Snacks may be purchased from the Hot Lunch counter with cash only. Items for purchase include, but are not limited to, chips, drinks, muffins and fruit.FORGOTTEN LUNCHESForgotten lunches should be brought to the Middle School building and placed on the stage. Students are taught to check the stage for their lunch before calling home. If a student has forgotten their lunch and a parent is unable to be reached, they are able to buy lunch with credit from the Hot Lunch counter. The student will need to bring cash money for payment the next day.VISITING DURING LUNCHAny family members visiting during lunch, must sign in with a license at either office. Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom.  We ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch.​If a parent wishes to send in a treat for their child’s birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school. It is the policy of Socrates Academy that all food provided for consumption of our scholars must be commercially prepared, with the ingredient label visible. Our allergy management policy can be found HERE​Volunteers are needed to work behind the Hot Lunch counter and also in the main cafeteria area.

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us ​What happens if I don't volunteer?Our volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have​ if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school. ​Why do I have to volunteer?North Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools. Charter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.Charter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities. In order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.​How many hours do I have to complete?36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.​ What constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?A volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.  Examples include: Participating in Committee workAttending Town Hall meetings or Board MeetingsPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetingsWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)Working a special eventFulfilling duties for committees	 What does not constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?Eating lunch with your scholarAttending parent/teacher conferences Can other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?We love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.​Can I donate my hours?Yes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name.

For example, K-2 students begin on November 3rd, NOT November 2nd.Carpool Tag Pick-up & Supply Drop OffFamilies will be given numbers instead of names for carpool this year. Staff working the carpool line will enter the number into a tablet and the name will be displayed on a screen in the child’s classroom. You MUST have a new sign to go through carpool.​Tags can be picked up the week of October 26th Monday - Thursday9am - 10am Monday, Wednesday & Thursday1:30pm - 2:30pm. Tuesday, (Oct. 27th) Evening4:00pm - 6:00pm Pick up will be located behind the Middle School building. Kindergarten may pick up signs and drop off supplies during their practice session. Kindergarten students who are not attending the practice session will need to come during pick up hours. ​Supply Drop OffWe are asking families to drop off supplies when they pick up their carpool tags. You Homeroom teacher will communicate what supplies are needed at this time. Please label all bags or boxes with your child's homeroom teacher. Remote families do not need to send in supplies.​Masks & Temperature ChecksPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.  You will be asked three questions by a staff member: Has your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?Does your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?Does your child have Co vid 19?​If you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.​No Walkers - Morning or AfternoonIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY. Late Pick-UpsStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park, call the office and walk to the doors, where the student will be waiting. After 3 late pick ups, students will be asked to move to Remote Instruction.HYBRID CALENDAR DOWNLOADBRING YOUR OWN DEVICE AGREEMENTREOPENING TRANSITION PLANMOVE TO REMOTEHYBRID PLAN PARENT HANDBOOKFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSASK A QUESTIONPROCEDURE VIDEOS​​Social Distance Tour >> Wear a Mask >>Ducks in a Row - Campus Walks >>Recess Before/After Procedures >>Arrive to Classroom in Morning >> Feeling Sick Procedure >>​Morning Carpool >>​Afternoon Carpool >>ELEMENTARYBELL SCHEDULE ARRIVAL:   7:45am - 8:10amTARDY AFTER:   8:10am​How to Sign In a Tardy StudentStudents who are tardy will need to be checked in by a parent in the Middle School Foyer.

From the moment your child's name is drawn in the enrollment lottery, Socrates Academy provides an exceptional range of opportunities for you to engage with their learning experience. We offer opportunities for HomeBase Parents to assist in the classroom. Beyond the classroom, parents can engage with school clubs to share a love of chess, journalism, or their personal area of expertise. Our commitment to keeping parents fully informed and engaged is reflected in this website. Here you will find information on past and upcoming events, teacher pages with updates on the latest happenings in the classroom and the extended learning that our scholars bring home, and contact information for your child's teachers. The school site includes printable forms, links to hot lunch ordering, up-to-date information on school procedures, and timely updates on school closures. In a partnership, the flow of information goes both ways and we value parent input as an integral component of our ongoing development. Through the PFI and regular Town Hall meetings, we invite you to play an active role in defining the future direction of the Socrates Academy community. We are thrilled that you and your children have joined the Socrates Academy community.

The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.​Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a "first come, first served" basis.​What is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.  Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time.

Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.​Our Core ValuesOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:• Filotimo (Greek: Φιλότιμο): Αlmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.• Arete (Greek: Αρετή): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.• Philoxenia (Greek: Φιλοξενία): eagerness to show hospitality• Ethos (Greek: Ηθος): Ethical Behavior• Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.• Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.• Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice• Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example• Strive for Excellence (Greek: Αιέν αριστεύειν): Setting goals and always striving to do one’s best and seeking continuous improvement​​The Socrates ApproachThe Academy’s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.  What is the Socratic Method?Definition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition. The Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights. The Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.  This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education. Want to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom? Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSEGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence. We look forward to watching our children flourish in their remaining years at Socrates, and feel confident that they will be well-prepared for the next big transition into high school."​- Mary Beth A., Socrates ParentContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ORDER SPIRIT WEAR | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreSPIRIT WEAR ORDER FORMContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyACADEMICS | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreACADEMICSThe Academy's bilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Standard Course of Study (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). The curriculum is an innovative research-based curriculum, developed by the Socrates Academy Curriculum Committee, which is made up of several distinguished faculty from UNC Charlotte with expertise in various aspects of education, English and other languages, mathematics, and technology. It is important to note that only a small percentage of the students of the Academy are of Greek heritage, and students from diverse cultures and backgrounds are greatly profiting from this approach. While part of each school day is taught in Greek, no prior knowledge of Greek is required.  It is, however, recommended that new students enter the Academy at the earliest grades possible in order to gain the greatest academic benefit. Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytic thinking.  The program is characterized by high academic quality and a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second language. CurriculumLiteracyElementary Students are taught using a balanced literacy approach to reading. This means that we pull the best research-based sources to teach reading and phonics.​Middle School Students Middle school scholars are taught at a rigorous level.

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us ​What happens if I don't volunteer?Our volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have​ if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school. ​Why do I have to volunteer?North Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools. Charter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.Charter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities. In order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.​How many hours do I have to complete?36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.​ What constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?A volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.  Examples include: Participating in Committee workAttending Town Hall meetings or Board MeetingsPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetingsWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)Working a special eventFulfilling duties for committees	 What does not constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?Eating lunch with your scholarAttending parent/teacher conferences Can other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?We love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.​Can I donate my hours?Yes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together. ​How will my hours be tracked?Use the volunteer log on the website to track your hours. You are now unable to search your hours online. We are looking at solutions, but for now, please make sure your email address is correct when you log your hours, because totals will be sent there. Please use the same email address each time you fill out the volunteer log.​​  Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademySUPPORT SOCRATES | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreTHE SOCRATES ACADEMY FOUNDATIONThe Socrates Foundation MissionThe Socrates Academy Foundation is a non-profit 501 (c)(3), community organization founded in 2008 in order to support the Socrates Academy, Inc. charter school. Its mission is to act as the fundraising arm of the Socrates Academy. All programs, projects and activities funded through the Foundation shall be used to enhance the Academy's educational programs and will be in alignment with its strategic plan, mission statement, goals, and budget considerations. Foundation MembersGretchen CarsonPresident​gcarson@socratesacademy.us Larry PeroulasMember​larry_peroulas@hotmail.comAntonis Stylianou, Ph.D.Member​astylianou@uncc.eduSocrates Foundation Frequently Asked Questions​Why does Socrates Academy need to raise funds? Isn't it a public school?Socrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.  Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.  Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves. ​What is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?Annual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for "brick and mortar type projects".  North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing. ​Are we seeking support from outside the school community?External support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is "What have you been able to raise internally?"  It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community. ​How will my funds be used?Donations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school’s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility. ​What is a Matching Gift Program?When a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization. For example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!Click here to see a list of companies we know that DO have Matching Gift programs Contact UsIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:foundation@socratesacademy.us Socrates Academy Foundation3909 Weddington RoadMatthews, NC 28105704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyABSENTEE REPORTING FORM | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreABSENTEE REPORTING FORMContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyCAMPUS LIFE | Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreCAMPUS LIFEClubsElementary ClubsRunning Owls (Girls Running Club)​Middle School ClubsNJHSYearbook ClubYoung Writers ClubC.O.L.E.TripsElementaryEach Grade Level takes an off campus field trip and scholars attend an on campus field trip that exposes them to cultural arts.​Middle SchoolEach Grade Level takes an off campus (overnight) field trip and scholars attend an on campus field trip that exposes them to cultural arts. 6th Grade - Camp Thunderbird7th Grade - Greece8th Grade - Washington D.C.Our TraditionsA list of our Schools Traditions can be found hereContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy HYBRID INSTRUCTION | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreHYBRID MODEL INSTRUCTIONThe dates above show the WEEK the scholars are attending, not the day. For example, K-2 students begin on November 3rd, NOT November 2nd.Carpool Tag Pick-up & Supply Drop OffFamilies will be given numbers instead of names for carpool this year. Staff working the carpool line will enter the number into a tablet and the name will be displayed on a screen in the child’s classroom. You MUST have a new sign to go through carpool.​Tags can be picked up the week of October 26th Monday - Thursday9am - 10am Monday, Wednesday & Thursday1:30pm - 2:30pm. Tuesday, (Oct. 27th) Evening4:00pm - 6:00pm Pick up will be located behind the Middle School building. Kindergarten may pick up signs and drop off supplies during their practice session. Kindergarten students who are not attending the practice session will need to come during pick up hours. ​Supply Drop OffWe are asking families to drop off supplies when they pick up their carpool tags. You Homeroom teacher will communicate what supplies are needed at this time. Please label all bags or boxes with your child's homeroom teacher. Remote families do not need to send in supplies.​Masks & Temperature ChecksPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.  You will be asked three questions by a staff member: Has your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?Does your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?Does your child have Co vid 19?​If you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.​No Walkers - Morning or AfternoonIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY. Late Pick-UpsStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park, call the office and walk to the doors, where the student will be waiting. After 3 late pick ups, students will be asked to move to Remote Instruction.HYBRID CALENDAR DOWNLOADBRING YOUR OWN DEVICE AGREEMENTREOPENING TRANSITION PLANMOVE TO REMOTEHYBRID PLAN PARENT HANDBOOKFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSASK A QUESTIONPROCEDURE VIDEOS​​Social Distance Tour >> Wear a Mask >>Ducks in a Row - Campus Walks >>Recess Before/After Procedures >>Arrive to Classroom in Morning >> Feeling Sick Procedure >>​Morning Carpool >>​Afternoon Carpool >>ELEMENTARYBELL SCHEDULE ARRIVAL:   7:45am - 8:10amTARDY AFTER:   8:10am​How to Sign In a Tardy StudentStudents who are tardy will need to be checked in by a parent in the Middle School Foyer.

After that time, we request that parents use carpool.

An alternative to bringing lunch is to order from our Hot Lunch Menu. Hot Lunch is prepared off site and brought in to the scholars and must be ordered 2-4 weeks in advance. Learn more about Hot Lunch HERE. Students walk from their classroom to lunch each day with their class and eat in the cafeteria with their teacher. Students are not permitted to share food. Students are not permitted to bring soda in their lunches. Students may not be pulled from class during instruction to have lunch with a sibling unless their lunch schedule is the same. The Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct applies to all student actions during lunch Socrates Academy provides a table in the cafeteria that is to be kept free of the type of allergen(s) that impact theidentified student(s). While this table is available to the identified student(s), they are not be required to eat only at this table. Snacks may be purchased from the Hot Lunch counter with cash only. Items for purchase include, but are not limited to, chips, drinks, muffins and fruit.FORGOTTEN LUNCHESForgotten lunches should be brought to the Middle School building and placed on the stage. Students are taught to check the stage for their lunch before calling home. If a student has forgotten their lunch and a parent is unable to be reached, they are able to buy lunch with credit from the Hot Lunch counter. The student will need to bring cash money for payment the next day.VISITING DURING LUNCHAny family members visiting during lunch, must sign in with a license at either office. Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom.  We ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch.​If a parent wishes to send in a treat for their child’s birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school. It is the policy of Socrates Academy that all food provided for consumption of our scholars must be commercially prepared, with the ingredient label visible. Our allergy management policy can be found HERE​Volunteers are needed to work behind the Hot Lunch counter and also in the main cafeteria area. If you would like to volunteer during lunches, please check the volunteer section at the bottom of the Socrates Connection for the sign up.HOT LUNCH​In order for the process to operate efficiently and enable the school to continue the hot lunch program, the following guidelines must be observed.  To Set Up an AccountGo to orgsonline.comClick on the “Create New Account"Enter the School ID: 278SANCFollow the remaining directionsYou MUST complete the payment information to place your order.A checking account, debit card or credit card will be needed to complete the payment informationContact Daniese Ingram at dingram@socratesacademy.us with your student's name and teacher name to be added to the appropriate lunch group.  If you skip this step, you will only be able to order sides and drinks. To Receive Email Notifications and AlertsGo to orgsonline.comGo to "your account" (it is on the left side panel)Click on "update my info"Check the box at the bottom of the page "yes, send me online news and notifications" OrdersMenus are online the 1st - 15th of every month.  Once the ordering period is closed, you will not be able to place your order; we are unable to accept any late orders.  Any orders that have not been paid for by the end of the ordering period will be deleted and not processed. PaymentsWe are now accepting debit and credit card payments through PayPal that includes a $3.00 processing fee.

Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.​Our Core ValuesOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:• Filotimo (Greek: Φιλότιμο): Αlmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.• Arete (Greek: Αρετή): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.• Philoxenia (Greek: Φιλοξενία): eagerness to show hospitality• Ethos (Greek: Ηθος): Ethical Behavior• Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.• Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.• Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice• Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example• Strive for Excellence (Greek: Αιέν αριστεύειν): Setting goals and always striving to do one’s best and seeking continuous improvement​​The Socrates ApproachThe Academy’s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.  What is the Socratic Method?Definition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition. The Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights. The Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.  This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education. Want to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom? Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSEGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence. We look forward to watching our children flourish in their remaining years at Socrates, and feel confident that they will be well-prepared for the next big transition into high school."​- Mary Beth A., Socrates ParentContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates Academy ADMISSIONS | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreADMISSIONSPlease read the Frequently Asked Questions before calling the school to inquire about the lottery process. ​Information about the school can also be found on the website under the Our School or you can join us for a tour or take a virtual tour.​ ​2021-2022STUDENT APPLICATIONAPPLICATIONS WILL GO LIVE ON NOVEMBER 5, 2020STUDENT APPLICATIONThe sibling application is ONLY for siblings of students who are currently attending school at Socrates Academy.SIBLING APPLICATIONTop of PageImportant Lottery DatesVisit SocratesFrequently Asked QuestionsREGISTRARRecords, transcripts & admissions information​Georgia Kastanasgkastanas@socratesacademy.us ​704-321-1711 x100Fax: 704-321-1714Apply to Socrates Academy​You may still apply for the current school year until December 15th but you will be added to the end of the wait list for the current year if there are no spots available. (Please Note: Proof of North Carolina residency will be required if you are accepted into Socrates Academy through the lottery process)​Socrates Academy is a North Carolina Public Charter School and to be eligible to attend you must be a legal resident of North Carolina.

Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. ​Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my child’s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings.

Here you will find information on past and upcoming events, teacher pages with updates on the latest happenings in the classroom and the extended learning that our scholars bring home, and contact information for your child's teachers. The school site includes printable forms, links to hot lunch ordering, up-to-date information on school procedures, and timely updates on school closures. In a partnership, the flow of information goes both ways and we value parent input as an integral component of our ongoing development.

It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. ​​Afternoon Carpool (6-8 Students)All cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. 	 If your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area.	 Begins at 3:30 pm. Grades 6-8 are dismissed from the upper parking lot. Parents will enter through the entrance between the painted rocks and will exit via Simfield Church Road.​Afternoon Carpool (K-5 Students)Begins at 3:30pm. Grades 4 and 5 are dismissed from the upper parking lot (with and without siblings). 	 Grades K-3 are dismissed from the lower lot (only if they do not have 4th-8th grade siblings).	 All students will go to the classroom of their older sibling for carpool. This includes K-3 students that have siblings in Middle School. 	 K-3 students with Middle School siblings, will not come into the Middle School, but will be supervised in the 4th and 5th Grade building. They will be called at the same time that their Middle School Sibling is called. The siblings will meet at the carpool zone.  There are NO left turns out of the school parking lots between the hours of 3:15pm-4:15pm. Cars must be in the parking lot before 3:55pm. If you arrive after carpool has ended, your student will be sent to Afterschool. There is a $1.00 per minute charge up to a maximum of $20.00 for this service.​​ ​General Guidelines WalkersScholars who walk must live within one mile of the school, and parents must complete a form to be approved by the administration.	 If a parent is driving a car to pick up a walker, then he or she must go through the carpool line.	 Elementary walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet in front of the Elementary Building.	 Middle School walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet at the roundabout near the Secondary School.​​Church Next DoorWe are NOT using the church next door for parking or carpool. Parents who park at the church do so at their own risk and may be towed. Parents are not to wait in the church parking lot until it is 3:00pm, when you are permitted to enter our lot for elementary dismissal.​​Cell PhonesCell phone use is prohibited to ensure that everyone is focused on keeping our scholars safe. Thank you for helping us maintain safety for everyone! Special NeedsIf you have a child with special needs, who may need additional assistance for morning and/or afternoon carpool please contact Vanessa Baker vbaker@socratesacademy.us or 704.321.1711 X175​Contact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademySUPPLY LISTS2 | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMore2020-2021 SUPPLY LISTSKindergarten Supply List First Grade Supply List Second Grade Supply List Third Grade Supply List Fourth Grade Supply List Fifth Grade Supply List​Living & Learning Classroom (by assignment only)  MIDDLE SCHOOL6th Grade: Please purchase supplies based on your students first elective choices.

Families are invited to donate to the school to support existing educational programs, develop new curriculum, improve school facilities, and support essential needs of Socrates Academy. The money raised through the Invest in a Scholar program will support exclusively the operational needs of the school and will not be used for any additional land purchases or new buildings being considered by the Board of Directors.WHY SUPPORT THE ANNUAL FUND?DONATE TO THE ANNUAL FUNDSET UP A RECURRING DONATIONThese Fundraisers BenefitOur Annual Fund, too!Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations: ​ 1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success – Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books – A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers. LEARN MOREContact UsHOME  |  CAREERS  |  FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714© Copyright 2019 by Socrates AcademyUNIFORMS | Socrates AcademyOUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreUniform Closet HoursHours are posted in the Connection each week.
