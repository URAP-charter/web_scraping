BOD August Announcement OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreSearchSocrates AcademyJul 282 min readBOD August AnnouncementGovernor Roy Cooper announced on July 14, 2020, that N.C. public schools would return to school for the 2020-2021 academic year utilizing a mixture of in-person and remote learning, but also allowing school districts flexibility to utilize remote learning as an option for all students.The difficult decisions that we have had to make in the past few months have been done with the health, safety, and welfare of our scholars and staff members in mind. There continues to be wide community spread of COVID-19 in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County area. The CDC has updated their guidance to clarify mitigation strategies based on level of community transmission of COVID-19. It suggests additional strategies “...be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community….” including the extension of schools offering distance learning. Three in four cases of COVID-19 occur in individuals ages 20-59. This put a majority of our staff population at risk.While our Board initially voted in favor of Plan B’s hybrid approach to opening, which would have included both in-person and remote instruction, that plan was contingent on having enough teacher support to provide high quality, grade level appropriate instruction to scholars while on campus.  An overwhelming majority of our teachers either cannot return to in-person instruction or are uncomfortable doing so, given the current metrics.  We are concerned about the quality of instruction that would be offered with less than 30% of the teaching staff available or if teachers are pressured to teach in person, against their own wishes.  Accordingly, without sufficient teacher support for the hybrid plan, the Board of Directors has approved our school year to start with remote learning. This decision will be reviewed by October 29, 2020 [the end of 1st quarter].  Our decision to return and the flexibility that will be offered to scholars and teachers desiring to continue with remote learning will be based on the metrics in our community at that time.  We are working through what those benchmarks will be and will communicate them for your planning purposes.More information will come in the following days about our distance learning program.  We are working to ensure that it is more rigorous than what we were forced into in the Spring, while at the same time taking into account families’ schedules and the mental health needs of our scholars. We understand that these are challenging times. It is difficult when we must consider modifying our course of action.

There are a lot of different opinions on how to return to learning this month. About the only thing we can all agree on is that no one is going to be happy with how this school year is starting.We get it. Distance learning doesn’t replace being in a classroom and is a struggle for parents, students, and teachers. At the same time, many educators and parents share concerns about the potential for the spread of COVID-19 at schools.The tough decisions on how communities are returning to schools are being made by your local school leaders under the requirements set forth by Governor Cooper and his team. Every school faces unique challenges that reflect the uniqueness of each community, so different decisions will be made for different communities. Currently, two out of three of North Carolina’s students will start this school year with distance learning.At your NC Department of Public Instruction, we have been supporting local schools and communities by providing multiple strategies on how schools can meet the COVID-19 requirements for in-person learning. We have worked closely with local districts to strengthen distance learning so that it is improved from what students, parents, and teachers faced at the end of last school year.

I continue to be amazed at the dedication of our staff and hard work of our scholars. From Socratic Seminars in 8th grade to Number Detectives in 1st grade, our teachers are engaging scholars in creative ways each day. We miss our scholars and cannot wait until the day they return to the building. But, in the meantime, we are committed to delivering excellence virtually.It is important to note that our teachers are reflecting each day on instruction and scholar needs. Teachers meet multiple times a week to collaboratively plan and analyze student progress. As we progress with remote learning, we will continue to evaluate our strengths and opportunities for improvement. One area we continue to evaluate is our K-4 Special Area classes. Feedback received in the summer was that many parents were concerned about screen time and lengthy school days. Special area classes were designated for one day a week in grades K-4 to reduce screen time and prevent a longer day. Parents have the option to structure the specials day in whatever manner meets the needs of your scholar. Scholars can complete the specials just as scheduled on their assigned day or alternatively, they can complete their specials throughout the week. Going forward, specials will be posted on the grade level weekly planner. Scholars will have until Friday to complete their special area assignments. Some have asked why we continue with special area classes during remote learning. Special area classes are not filler classes. Instead, each class serves a purpose to help our scholars meet standards in the areas of information and technology, physical education, literacy, and the arts. For many scholars, they look forward to these classes and it provides a creative outlet for them to excel. Soon the special area team will begin hosting live sessions for scholars to join and complete activities. Look for more information to come about this exciting event.

There continues to be wide community spread of COVID-19 in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County area. The CDC has updated their guidance to clarify mitigation strategies based on level of community transmission of COVID-19. It suggests additional strategies “...be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community….” including the extension of schools offering distance learning. Three in four cases of COVID-19 occur in individuals ages 20-59. This put a majority of our staff population at risk.While our Board initially voted in favor of Plan B’s hybrid approach to opening, which would have included both in-person and remote instruction, that plan was contingent on having enough teacher support to provide high quality, grade level appropriate instruction to scholars while on campus.  An overwhelming majority of our teachers either cannot return to in-person instruction or are uncomfortable doing so, given the current metrics.  We are concerned about the quality of instruction that would be offered with less than 30% of the teaching staff available or if teachers are pressured to teach in person, against their own wishes.  Accordingly, without sufficient teacher support for the hybrid plan, the Board of Directors has approved our school year to start with remote learning. This decision will be reviewed by October 29, 2020 [the end of 1st quarter].  Our decision to return and the flexibility that will be offered to scholars and teachers desiring to continue with remote learning will be based on the metrics in our community at that time.  We are working through what those benchmarks will be and will communicate them for your planning purposes.More information will come in the following days about our distance learning program.  We are working to ensure that it is more rigorous than what we were forced into in the Spring, while at the same time taking into account families’ schedules and the mental health needs of our scholars. We understand that these are challenging times. It is difficult when we must consider modifying our course of action.

I continue to be amazed at the dedication of our staff and hard work of our scholars. From Socratic Seminars in 8th grade to Number Detectives in 1st grade, our teachers are engaging scholars in creative ways each day. We miss our scholars and cannot wait until the day they return to the building. But, in the meantime, we are committed to delivering excellence virtually.It is important to note that our teachers are reflecting each day on instruction and scholar needs. Teachers meet multiple times a week to collaboratively plan and analyze student progress. As we progress with remote learning, we will continue to evaluate our strengths and opportunities for improvement. One area we continue to evaluate is our K-4 Special Area classes. Feedback received in the summer was that many parents were concerned about screen time and lengthy school days. Special area classes were designated for one day a week in grades K-4 to reduce screen time and prevent a longer day. Parents have the option to structure the specials day in whatever manner meets the needs of your scholar. Scholars can complete the specials just as scheduled on their assigned day or alternatively, they can complete their specials throughout the week. Going forward, specials will be posted on the grade level weekly planner. Scholars will have until Friday to complete their special area assignments. Some have asked why we continue with special area classes during remote learning. Special area classes are not filler classes. Instead, each class serves a purpose to help our scholars meet standards in the areas of information and technology, physical education, literacy, and the arts. For many scholars, they look forward to these classes and it provides a creative outlet for them to excel. Soon the special area team will begin hosting live sessions for scholars to join and complete activities. Look for more information to come about this exciting event.

There are a lot of different opinions on how to return to learning this month. About the only thing we can all agree on is that no one is going to be happy with how this school year is starting.We get it. Distance learning doesn’t replace being in a classroom and is a struggle for parents, students, and teachers. At the same time, many educators and parents share concerns about the potential for the spread of COVID-19 at schools.The tough decisions on how communities are returning to schools are being made by your local school leaders under the requirements set forth by Governor Cooper and his team. Every school faces unique challenges that reflect the uniqueness of each community, so different decisions will be made for different communities. Currently, two out of three of North Carolina’s students will start this school year with distance learning.At your NC Department of Public Instruction, we have been supporting local schools and communities by providing multiple strategies on how schools can meet the COVID-19 requirements for in-person learning. We have worked closely with local districts to strengthen distance learning so that it is improved from what students, parents, and teachers faced at the end of last school year. It still will not be perfect, but it will be better and specifically should have more live interactions with teachers, even if over video chats.
