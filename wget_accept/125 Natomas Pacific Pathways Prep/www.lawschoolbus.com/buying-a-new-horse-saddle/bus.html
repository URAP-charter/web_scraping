	<h1>Saddles For Sale</h1>

	<div id="main_content-display-12">As a horse owner sooner or later the saddle that you have been using with your horse will get old, torn, and unusable. Eventually everybody finds themselves in a position where they have to buy a new horse saddle. And when you find yourself searching through the endless saddles for sale you might find that you become frustrated and end up buying one judged purely on its looks rather than doing what you should have been doing, and that is buying one that will fit the horse correctly.

This is the mistake that we see many riders making and one that happens all too often. It also a case of you get what you pay for since more often than not the more expensive horse saddles for sale tend to be of better quality. The problem were cheap saddles is that many of them use synthetic material such as foam that is almost impossible to repair once it has become compressed due to wear and tear. This is why we always go for the more expensive yet more durable leather saddles.

Having the correct saddle for your horse is just one part of the equation as you should already know by now. Good quality stirrups and bridles also counts towards both your horse is comfort and yours and should not be overlooked either. You shouldn’t even consider riding your horse until you are confident that you know all there is to know about what they should wear and how they should be wearing it. Really it shouldn’t take you more than a few days of learning this either in a book, online, or from your local saddler. If you don’t already know the basics then there is no better time than now to begin learning.

Spending a few hundred dollars on a new saddle and not looking after it is complete madness. Just by keeping the saddle’s leather lubricated with a special oil you can ensure that the saddle will last many more years than had you done nothing at all. The file itself can be found at many stores online and can even be combined with beeswax and other products in order to keep it from drying out. Dried out leather on a saddle can be mended, but each time you allow it to dry out it significantly decreases the overall quality.

For riders who are having difficulties in maintaining good posture and connection to the horse treeless saddles come highly recommended. The seats of these saddles are primarily made from felt, canvas, or wood and some even come with panels that are made from similar materials. If you need to wash your treeless saddle then you can use a damp cloth which will help in removing any sweat particles and residue that might have arisen from splashed up dirt that you may have picked up on your recent outings. There is no need to use any detergent or anything like that as by doing so you increase the chance of damaging the material that is made from.

Have you ever found that you need to almost continuously dig your heels into your horse’s side in order to stay on board? This is a common sign that the saddle is not bit incorrectly and you are most likely rocking from front to back at almost every opportunity the horse gives. This is a poor situation to find yourself in and one that must be fixed immediately by either adding more padding underneath the saddle or if that doesn’t work then perhaps a new saddle for sale is in order.
