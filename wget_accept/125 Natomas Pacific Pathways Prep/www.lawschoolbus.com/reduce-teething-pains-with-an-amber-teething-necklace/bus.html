	<h1>Reduce Teething Pains With An Amber Teething Necklace</h1>

	<div id="main_content-display-12">Not just a natural pain relief, genuine Baltic amber offers so much more. It can be used to lessen or dampen down the feelings of pain as well as give the entire body more strength, boost energy levels and even help with inflamed body joints. While amber teething necklaces are probably the most popular products that use amber for its healing properties, it has been proven that the medical properties that are succinic acid within the amber have been used for thousands of years.
<BR><BR>
The rise of amber teething necklaces seems to go on and on. Perhaps this is because of word-of-mouth, a steady advertising campaign, or possibly because they actually do work in helping to treat teething problems and pains within young children.
<BR><BR>
Having gone through the dreaded process of teething pain in the first of my children I knew that I couldn’t face this all over again once we had our latest twins. My wife of 10 years was told about the amazing healing properties that the succinic acid within the amber could have for our twins and we both agreed to try them out despite some negativity in regards to the safety features for Amber teething necklaces.
<BR><BR>
Perhaps some of this negativity is justified given that there is always a chance that any young child and especially a baby can choke or strangle themselves on either the small pieces of amber or with the string that holds them together. We are not irresponsible parents by any means and so we took that upon ourselves to delve deep into these safety warnings and see if it was the right decision for us.
<BR><BR>
At the end of the day and after weighing all the options up we decided that the safety clasp that comes standard with most of the genuine Baltic amber teething necklace for sale was enough to alleviate any concerns that we had about either of the twins strangling themselves with the string. Of course we were not just going to trust the safety warnings on their own, instead we were going to make sure that neither of them would ever be able to wear them unless they were under our strict supervision.
<BR><BR>
Obviously after that there was still the chance of the strings breaking and one of our beloved children putting one of the pieces in their mouths. This was a major stumbling block but as it turns out in the end we had nothing to worry about since after just a couple of days our two little tots seems to almost forget that they were even wearing them despite us taking them on and off the regular intervals during the day to ensure that they were wearing them only as we kept a close eye on them.
<BR><BR>
It’s now been five weeks since we got these amazing pieces of jewellery and both of our twins’ teething pains seem to have rescinded in a most notable fashion. No longer do we have to deal with the crying, drooling and overall unhappiness that they had been experiencing in the weeks leading up to us giving them the amber teething necklaces for the first time, but now we have two beautiful little girls and seem content in themselves and happy to go about their busy daily little routines!
<BR><BR>
What’s more, we know that the amber that has been used in the necklaces is actually genuine Baltic amber hailing from the Baltic regions of Europe as we have visually tested and performed the salt water test to make sure that it floats rather than sinks. Luckily we were warned of the many fake necklaces doing the rounds on the internet before we made the purchase, but at just over $10 I suppose it wouldn’t have been the end of the world if we had to replace them. The point is that you should ensure that you are going to get a genuine Baltic amber teething necklace by doing as much research as possible if you are considering on buying one yourself.
