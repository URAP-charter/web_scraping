	<h1>Are Drysuits For Sale Better Than Wetsuits</h1>

	<div id="main_content-display-12">Depending on who you speak to you will likely hear that either drysuits are better than wetsuits or vice versa. It’s not always the case, but most likely it will be the owner of one type or the other telling you that their suit is the best. Well as the owner of both we can emphatically tell you that drysuits win by a long country mile.
<BR><BR>
Why would anybody prefer to get wet when they can just as easily stay dry? A good wetsuit will cost you a few hundred dollars, and a top of the range Kokatat drysuit will more than likely cost between $900 and $1200. Obviously there is quite a price difference between the two and perhaps drysuits and made with those short in cash in mind, but the overall quality and benefits that they bring to the table far outweigh the costs.
<BR><BR>
Kokatat drysuits are easily the most popular drysuits for sale and for good reason. The high end garments are made out of expensive GORE-TEX that is designed to keep you warm, dry and safe and secure in the knowledge that both you and any of your personal possessions that you might have in a specially designed pouch will be kept away from any of the water that surrounds you.
<BR><BR>
You may be completely submersed in this water using a buoyancy control and valves to manoeuvre about, r even sitting in your kayak, but when you are wearing one of these drysuits you are completely at ease with your surroundings as you know that the chances of you getting wet are minimal. Maybe it’s just us but we think that the price that they charge is fair considering the peace of mind that it offers to its end user.
<BR><BR>
Many people seem to be put off buying a drysuit and display complete shock when they see the prices that they are being sold for.  But you have to way of the pros and cons and eventually the right decision will come to you. Were not saying that you “need” to have a dry suit since obviously anybody can get by using a wetsuit instead, but who wants to be wet when you can be dry!
<BR><BR>
Let it be said here and now that no other dry suit compares to a Kokatat drysuit. But if you need to save money then there are many other well respected retailers such as Level Six, OS systems, Bomber Gear and NRS, each of which carry an amazing line of reasonably priced drysuits for sale. But if you want to go with the best then there is no better option than Kokatat.
<BR><BR>
If you will eventually do end up buying a drysuit then taking care of it should be your number one priority. You should get into the habit of routinely rinsing and cleaning your suit for up to 20 minutes at a time under running water in a shower while also taking just as much time to ensure that the neck and feel gaskets and the zip at all in good condition. Performing these often mundane tasks can feel a bit depressing at times but this is all part and parcel of owning your own drysuit. Just don’t say you weren’t warned!
