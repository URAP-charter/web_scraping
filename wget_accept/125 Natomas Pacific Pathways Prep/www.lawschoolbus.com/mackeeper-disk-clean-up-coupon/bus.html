	<h1>Use Mackeeper's Disk Cleanup With A Coupon Code From Eccouponcode</h1>

	<div id="main_content-display-12">Mackeeper is a nasty piece of software that does nothing more than disrupt your Mac, oh and it’s a virus too. At least that’s how some people would have you believe, but the truth is that the software which was released in 2010 by then owners Zeobit, is one of the most complete and robust antivirus and disk cleanup solutions that you can purchase for your Mac or MacBook Pro.
<BR><BR>
Granted, the software has come in for some stick during this time, and more so about the advertising practices which were carried on during Zeobit’s time of ownership rather than about the software itself, though there have been quite a number of comments made negatively about the software as well.
<BR><BR>
Perhaps some of these negative comments were correct about the advertising practices that Zeobit carried on, with many of the complaints stating that annoying pop-up ads that exaggerated the severity other problem with disk space were simply uncalled for. Well I’m sure the people who made these comments would be glad to know that Zeobit are paying the consequences by way of a legal action which has brought against them to the tune of $2 million which they must refund to previous purchasers of the software.
<BR><BR>
They must have deep pockets or have sold a lot of copies of the software during this time to be able to afford to pay this extraordinary settlement. Quite a chunk of the money will go on paying their solicitors and lawyers as legal fees, but the rest will likely never reach every customer who purchased Mackeeper during this time since they are targeting them through adverts on Facebook, was not every customer will either see the ads or take action to claim their refund so this could be their saving grace.
<BR><BR>
In an other act of good fortune it seems that Zeobit knew the writing was on the wall and sold Mackeeper to a company known as Kromtech who are running the show to this day. Some people may find it a little bit dubious that some of the staff travelled thousands of miles to work in the new offices location, but it is clear to see that the new owners are taking things a little more seriously. Its claimed that in their day Zeobit placed up to 60 million ads per month that targeted Mac users with these type of adverts, making them one of, if not the largest advertisers to target this market. While there are question marks as to whether it was actually them or the affiliates who worked on their behalf who undertook this type of advertising, one thing is for sure - The new owners have walked away from the mess with their heads held high and with a clean bill of health.
<BR><BR>
As an all in one security and clean up package for your mac, Mackeeper includes what has to be said the best antivirus and safe browsing capabilities of all the similar software that we tested leading up to writing this blog post. When you combine the fact that they even throw in another 15 mini tool on top of this it really does speak wonders for the user experience that even a typical mac user who prefers to surf the internet browsing sites such as Twitter, Facebook and others will enjoy.
<BR><BR>
For other who are more serious about their work, Mackeeper is a Godsend like no other. By using a Mackeeper coupon code <a href="http://www.encouponcode.com">encouponcode have made it possible to get the software at a knockdown price of less than thirty dollars off</a> from the original asking price. This saving applies to customers who purchase the twenty four month option, although there are a range of savings on all other plans including the twelve and six month plans. Our advice would be to avoid all the negativity that you most likely will come across since most of this is outdated and dates back to the time of the previous owners, and instead concentrate on what Mackeeper can deliver for you.
