				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer Workbooks are the perfect answers for helping your child retain what was learned this school year. Each workbook offers a thorough review of the grade just completed and is designed to prepare students for their next grade.  By taking about ten to twenty minutes and doing approximately two pages a day, you can help build your child’s confidence while keeping him/her actively engaged in learning all summer long!  The Monument Academy curriculum-based activity book includes a variety of subjects such as: Cursive, Phonics, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Writing, Math, Social Studies, Science and a suggested summertime reading list.</p>
<p>At the end of the summer, we’ll celebrate with a party for all students who have completed their workbooks. Watch for more details prior to the end of May.</p>
<p>To order, go to<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://spiritwear.monumentacademy.net/collections/summerworkbooks">http://spiritwear.monumentacademy.net/collections/summerworkbooks</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>January 10, 2017 Update</h4>
<p>On January 9th, the Board voted to proceed with applications to seek authorization for a Monument Academy High School.</p>
<p>The decision to move forward was based on several factors (while these were not all of the factors considered, they were significant):</p>
<ul>
<li>Several individual members of the Board and Administration have met with representatives of District 38, District 49 and Douglas County.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Board received input from MA’s legal counsel and bond counsel concerning structure and financing this effort.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Parent comments as well as the number of Letters of Intent to enroll in a MA High School were shared with the Board.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Board has reviewed MA’s draft application.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MA Board, in its decision to expand, sought the best situations and solutions that fit MA’s current philosophy, the high school’s proposed academic intent and parent wishes.   As such, the Board approved applying simultaneously to District 38, District 49 and Douglas County.  The application windows for all three districts would mean MA filing in the late summer early fall.</p>
<p>It was also determined that all three districts did not see an easy path to open in 2017.  Thus, the applications will reflect an opening date of no sooner than the 2018-2019 school year.</p>
<p>A High School Information Meeting has been scheduled for <strong>Thursday, February 16<sup>th</sup> at 6:00p.m.</strong> at which time additional information will be given and afford you an opportunity to ask questions.</p>
<p>The Board remains excited and confident that the future of Monument Academy K-8 will continue its pursuit of excellence and the real possibility of a Monument Academy High School will provide yet another choice for parents and students of the Tri-Lakes area.</p>
<h4>December 6, 2016 Update</h4>
<p>For two decades Monument Academy (MA) has met the lofty goals it has set for itself, and currently provides a top quality education to its students. MA consistently ranks high on student achievement metrics, and maintains a lengthy waitlist due to community demand. It is the collective belief of MA that a defined, traditional, culturally-literate and classically based curriculum, taught effectively and engagingly, with an overarching emphasis on character, prepares students to become active, responsible citizens.</p>
<p>After many years of providing a high quality education to students in grades K through 8, the leadership and community believe that now is the time to expand and provide a high school option for students that focuses on academic achievement, character development, and leadership. It will be the vision of Monument Academy High School (“MAHS”) to <em>Build Leaders for Today for our Future Tomorrow</em>.</p>
<p>While many of the characteristics that have made MA great will remain at the core of an expansion to MAHS, it is within the vision to expand upon the solid foundation laid for students by providing a unique educational program, tailored toward high school age students. MAHS will provide a unique leadership program, with an emphasis on the servant-leadership model, to all of its students. Students will build a leadership portfolio with culminating projects/performances in their graduation year. MAHS will provide a classical approach to high school education that emphasizes use of original or primary source texts, using the Socratic Method, and awakening the inquisitive minds of students to gain knowledge. As part of its leadership program students will enroll in a Leadership Academy, being offered in partnership with renowned Strata Leadership, in grades 9 and 10 that will cover topics like teamwork, trust, communication and listening skills, time and stress management, and setting and reaching goals. In grades 11 and 12 students will have opportunities to apply what they’ve learned and get real life training, skills and experience through an internship program that will place students with one of MAHS’s community partners.</p>
<p>MAHS’s students will be provided with opportunities to earn college credit through a concurrent enrollment program, partnering with respected providers like U.C.C.S. and Grand Canyon University. These offerings will be balanced with a full performing arts program as a potential career path as students enter their 11th and 12th grade years. Rather than students being faced with the prospect of dropping out of school to pursue artistic endeavors, MAHS will actively seek students who are oriented toward an arts education and provide them with the leadership skills, like time management and goal setting, coupled with robust opportunities to pursue arts as a vocation through an internship with a community partner. MAHS will round out its vision by offering diverse extra-curricular opportunities for athletics, writing, technology, business leadership, and many other programs desired by its student population.</p>
<p>After careful and thoughtful planning, we have developed an initial five year plan that anticipates the opening of a high school that will serve not only students who attend MA during their K-8 schooling, but also to provide a unique opportunity to all high school age students in the area. It is the collective belief of MA that a defined traditional, culturally-literate and classically based curriculum, taught effectively and engagingly, with an overarching emphasis on character, prepares students to become active, responsible citizens.</p>
<p>MAHS anticipates starting in 2017-18 with only 9th grade students, and expanding by one grade level each year, with approximately 100 students per grade, until the school serves students at all levels of high school. Our plan projects the following enrollment numbers:</p>
<p>Year 1: Approximately 100 students ninth grade<br />
Year 2: Approximately 200 students in ninth and tenth grade<br />
Year 3: Approximately 300 students in ninth, tenth, and eleventh grade<br />
Year 4: Approximately 400 students in ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade<br />
Year 5: Approximately 400 students in ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade</p>
<p>The mission and tenets that have served MA so well in realizing its vision to develop free-thinking, well-rounded citizens of character will remain the same as we expand into a high school. MA receives numerous requests each year from students and families desirous of a high school option that continues to build upon the foundation that has been laid during their time at MA. We are now responding to this demand by seeking to expand and open MAHS.</p>

<p>It is the philosophy of Monument Academy that all students benefit from a challenging, content- rich, educational program that builds academic potential and personal character. The school provides an environment that fosters academic excellence through the habits of thoroughness, the willingness to work, and the perseverance to complete difficult tasks. Through a defined traditional, culturally-literate and classically-based curriculum students are prepared to become active, responsible citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Seven Tenets of Success:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Traditional</strong> &#8211; We stand by the traditional approach of educating students. We resist the constant pendulum that swings in the halls of universities and education laboratories unless over the test of time it has made effective research-based gains that is best for our students. We honor mastery in pure form, reading, writing, mathematics, science, and history.</p>
<p><strong>Classical</strong> &#8211; We practice a classical approach integrated in every angle of our instruction. This is a genuine appreciation for the rich past, forefathers of the past and their understanding of principle, lessons of the past, literature of the past, and the culture of the past. This includes all subject content. Guiding students to draw from the past to build greater understanding and to believe their ideas are equally valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Character is Valued</strong> &#8211; We hold our teachers and parents in special esteem. Teachers are professionals and they are valued to help lay the foundational knowledge that pushes students beyond. Our teachers are passionate and committed lifelong learners. Parents are the ultimate authority of their children and educators are the extension of aid to assist in the process of character training. Character training is an essential element in partnering together to develop our young people into our future citizens and leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Caretakers of the Language</strong> &#8211; We honor the English language and the origins from which it came. Students must gain an appreciation of one&#8217;s own language and that of others. Language study is opening doors to new worlds of knowledge and culture. Caring for the language integrally involves great books. Classic literature read thoroughly and with purpose guides students in appreciation of culture and language of others.</p>
<p><strong>American and Patriotic</strong> &#8211; We are unapologetically grateful citizens of this great nation. Our students will understand from where we came and the responsibility of citizens and exactly what the founding fathers intended for our Republic. We will honor our veterans and the tremendous price paid for our freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Caretakers of the Mind</strong> &#8211; We value the ability for students to think on their own. Socratic dialogue, rich engaging discussion, inquiry learning and much more is primary to students thinking on their own. We desire for MA students to grow into powerful thinkers who do not ever fall into the trap of allowing others to think for them.</p>

<p><strong>School for the Arts</strong> &#8211; We understand education without the arts is not complete or balanced. The primary means by which human beings cultivate the beautiful is through the arts. At MA , the arts are taught through music and “art”: painting and drawing, but also the appreciation of sculpture and, to a lesser extent, architecture. In keeping with the way of liberal education, the school teaches music and art largely though the works of the best masters: Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Monet. At the same time, the arts require an intensive study of technique, both to appreciate the great works and to try to make or perform art on one’s own.</p>
