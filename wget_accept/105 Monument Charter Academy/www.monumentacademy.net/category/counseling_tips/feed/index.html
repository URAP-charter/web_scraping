				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holidays are a wonderful time of year to spend with friends and family.  It can also be a tremendous source of stress on us—much of which can unwittingly be passed on to our children.  Reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unrealistic expectations of the holidays—it’s rarely the idea presented on Hallmark cards</li>
<li>Perceptions of not being or having enough</li>
<li>Loss of control—trying to be all things to all people, over-commitments that create feelings of resentment rather than gratitude</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine this this on top of other sources of stress and it’s a perfect storm.  Americans report the following are significant sources of stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money (64 percent)</li>
<li>Work (60 percent)</li>
<li>The economy (49 percent)</li>
<li>Family responsibilities (47 percent)</li>
<li>Personal health concerns (46 percent)</li>
</ul>
<p>The effects are real.  Most reported symptoms of stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Irritable or angry (37 percent)</li>
<li>Feeling nervous or anxious (35 percent)</li>
<li>Having a lack of interest or motivation (34 percent)</li>
<li>Fatigue (32 percent)</li>
<li>Feeling overwhelmed (32 percent)</li>
<li>Depressed or sad (32 percent)</li>
</ul>
<p>Effects of stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 out of 4 doctor’s visits are for stress-related ailments</li>
<li>Stress increases the risk of:
<ul>
<li>Heart disease by 40%</li>
<li>Heart attack by 25%</li>
<li>Stroke by 50%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>40% of stressed people overeat or eat unhealthy foods</li>
<li>44% lose sleep every night</li>
<li>26% of parents and 25% of millennials say they do not have emotional support</li>
<li>42% of adults say they are not doing enough or are not sure whether they are doing enough to manage their stress</li>
<li>20% percent say they are not engaging in an activity to help relieve or manage their stress</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the holidays offer the perfect opportunity to experience lots of stress. We can take care of ourselves by creating our own realistic image of what the holidays should be and staying focused on that. Finally, below is a simple formula for the holidays and all year long:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Daily</strong>: Do one thing that feeds your soul</li>
<li><strong>Weekly</strong>: Do one thing you delight in</li>
<li><strong>Always</strong>: Have something on your calendar you are looking forward to.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have a blessed holiday.</p>

However, we often think of homework as an entity in and of itself.  It may be more helpful to think of it as an extension of a relationship. Nothing happens in a vacuum.  Below are some thoughts to help ease the stress of getting homework done from a relational perspective.  In the next Counselor’s Corner, I’ll offer some practical solutions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>  Try less control: </strong>Parents often feel it’s their <em>job</em>to get their kids to do well in school. Homework often becomes the focus of concerns and fears about being a good parent and, kids succeeding in life. According to <em>Empowering Parents </em>author<em> </em>Debbie Pincus, “When parents feel it’s their responsibility to get their kids to achieve, they now <em>need </em>something from their children—they need them to do their homework and be a success. I believe this need puts you in a powerless position as a parent because your child doesn’t have to give you what you want. The battle about homework actually becomes a battle over control. Your child starts fighting to have more control over the choices in his life, while you feel that your job as a parent is to be in control of things. So you both fight harder, and it turns into a war in your home.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>   Don’t work harder than your child: </strong>Ultimately you can’t want it more for them than they want it for themselves. Caring and motivation often come from ownership. You can help your child be motivated by allowing them to own it. That is, let them own their disappointment over grades. Don’t feel it more than they do. Let them choose what they will or will not do about their homework and allow them to face the consequences. Now they will begin to feel ownership, which may lead to caring. Let them figure out what motivates them…it shouldn’t be fear of you. Help guide but don’t prevent them from feeling real life consequences. Think of it this way: It’s better for your child to learn from the consequences of failing at the age of ten versus learning at 25 by losing his job.</li>
<li><strong>Take the emotion out of the equation: </strong>One way to stop fighting with your kids is to simply stop. Disengage from the dance. If you feel yourself getting reactive or frustrated, take a break. Take five or ten minutes to calm down, and let your child do the same. When emotions kick in, it’s a no-win situation.</li>
<li><strong>  Help, but don’t take ownership.  </strong>Your child needs guidance from you, but understand that guidance does not mean doing homework for them. When you take on your child’s work, you put their responsibilities on your shoulders. Guide them through editing a book report, help review before a test, or use James Lehman’s “Hurdle Help” to start them on homework. If your child asks for help, coach them. Suggest talking to a teacher on how to be a good student and teach good communication skills. In other words, show them how to help themselves.</li>
<li><strong>   Don’t focus on the battle and lose the war.</strong>Keep homework in perspective. Don’t sacrifice the relationship just to get homework done. Frankly, it’s not worth it  Ask yourself, what will matter most in 5 years?<strong> </strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Homework is a topic that causes anxiety for parents and students, leading to arguments, hurt feelings or worse.  It’s also a complicated issue. When we say, “I want to help,” children often hear, “You can’t do it.”  Below are more ideas that may help reduce the emotions and anxiety surrounding homework.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Observe.</strong> First, start by slowing down and simply observing the typical family dance to see what role you and/or your spouse contribute to your child’s refusal, struggle and apathy. If you carry more of the worry, fear, disappointments, and concern than your child does about his work, ask yourself “What’s wrong with this picture and how did this happen?” Remember, as long as you carry their concerns, they don’t have to. Adjusting your level of concern may be the first and best step.</li>
<li><strong>Put a structure in place. </strong>Put limits in place and enforce them without emotion. Set the expectations, but don’t get into a debate.  If the expectations are not met, then enact consequences. I like the Love and Logic approach and just say, “If you don’t do what we ask, then we’ll have to do something.” Below are some examples of limits:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8211; Homework is done at the same time each night.<br />
&#8211; Homework is done in a public area of your house.<br />
&#8211; If grades are failing or falling, take away screen time so your child can focus and have more time to concentrate on his work.     Apps like <em>OurPact </em>are free and work well to limit electronics.<br />
&#8211; The weekend doesn’t start until homework is completed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Use natural consequences: </strong>Within the parameters you set around schoolwork, your child is free to make choices. This space allows your child to learn responsibility. If you take too much control over the situation, it will backfire by turning it into a power struggle.I’ve seen kids purposely do poorly just to show their parents “who’s in charge.” I’ve also seen children who complied to ease their parents’ anxiety, but these same kids never learned to think and make choices for themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>They choose to do homework or not, as well as the level of effort. The logical consequences will come from these choices. You can always ask questions that aren’t loaded, like,</p>
<p>“Are you satisfied with how things are going?&#8221;</p>
<p>“If not, what do you want to do about it?”</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Ask yourself what worked in the past: </strong>Think about a time when your child has gotten homework done well and with no hassles. What was different? What made it work that time? Ask your child about it and believe what they say. See what works and motivates <em>them</em>instead of what motivates <em>you</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Intrinsic vs Extrinsic motivators:</strong> Extrinsic motivators are rewards we get <em>after</em> we do something.  Intrinsic motivators are rewards we get <em>while</em> we do something.  Intrinsic is the goal.  External rewards work best when given intermittently.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent</strong>.  Whatever you try, remember to be consistent.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are changing rules and patterns to affect behavior, remember people resist change, especially if it is someone else’s idea.  With change things will likely get worse before they get better, but stick with it for at least a month before giving up.  Like changing any habit, it takes time, patience and consistency.</p>

Below are some tips to help create some space to facilitate communication.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Don’t try to fix it</strong>—listen and ask questions that lead the student to solving the problem themselves.</li>
<li><strong> Be careful with advice</strong>—many children want you to fix their problem or tell them what to do. DON’T! It deprives them of the learning opportunity to wrestle with a dilemma. Plus, if your suggestion doesn’t work, they&#8217;ll have you to blame.</li>
<li><strong> Don’t judge</strong>. If a student has decided to share something personal with you, gratefully accept it (unless there is a safety issue). Telling them what they should feel or think will reduce the chance they’ll continue to confide in you. They more they feel they can share with you; a bigger part of the lives you can be.</li>
<li><strong> Ask if you’re unsure.</strong> &#8220;Do you want help fixing this or just need someone to listen?&#8221; You’d be surprised how many times they just want an ear—not a fix.</li>
<li><strong> Monitor yourself.</strong> Did your reaction show your disapproval of what they just said?  Did it tell them how uncomfortable you are? A surprised look, grimace or inappropriate smile can shut down a conversation as quick as anything. You can never go wrong with a neutral, but interested expression.</li>
<li><strong> Don’t give tissues to a crying child.</strong> This may sound cold, but pushing tissues on them says, “I’m not comfortable with this and I’d like you to stop.” Have tissues available on your desk easily available for the taking. More on the benefits of crying later.</li>
<li><strong> Talk less and listen more</strong>—Be very comfortable with silence and waiting.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>&#8220;It seems only the old are able to sit next to one another and not say anything and still feel content. The young, brash and impatient, must always break the silence. It is a waste, for silence is pure. Silence is holy. It draws people together because only those who are comfortable with each other can sit without speaking. This is the great paradox.” ― Nicholas Sparks, The Notebook</em></p>
<p>Remember, you may be the only person they feel like they can approach to share their most personal fears and hopes. What a privilege and honor!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are traumatic events that can have negative, lasting effects on health and well-being. These experiences range from physical, emotional, or sexual abuse to parental divorce or the incarceration of a parent or guardian. </p>
<p>Across the U.S. for children, up to age 17:<br />
• Just under half (46 percent) of children in the U.S. have experienced at least one ACE. In 16 states, a slight majority of children have experienced at least one ACE.<br />
• Abuse of alcohol or drugs, exposure to neighborhood violence, and the occurrence of mental illness are among the most commonly-reported adverse childhood experiences in every state.<br />
• In Colorado, an estimated 33% have experienced 1 to 2 ACEs and 10% have experienced 3 or more.<br />
• That means that in one of our classes of 25  students, about 10 students have experienced some trauma, and about 4 students have had 3 or more traumatic events.<br />
 The consequences are real. Students with an ACE score (i.e. at least 1 traumatic event): • Are 2 ½ times more likely to fail a grade • Score lower on standardized tests • Have language difficulties • Are suspended or expelled more • Are designated to special education more frequently • Have poorer health</p>
<p>The higher the score the greater the risks:<br />
• A male child with an ACE score of 6 has a 4,600% increase in the likelihood that he will become an IV drug user later in life<br />
• Childhood and adolescent suicide attempts increased 5,100% with an ACE score of 7 or more.<br />
• There is a graded relationship between ACE scores Absenteeism, Serious Financial Problems and Job Problems later in life</p>
<p>While we can’t change these facts, they help us understand our students and realize more than we’d care to believe are struggling with significant issues.</p>

Some data may surprise you. In fact, based on the data, our staff is at a far greater risk of suicide than our students. Below are the most current stats:</p>
<p>Men die by suicide 3.5x more often than women.<br />
On average, there are 117 suicides per day.<br />
White males accounted for 7 of 10 suicides in 2014.<br />
Firearms account for almost 50% of all suicides.<br />
The rate of suicide is highest in middle age — white men in particular.<br />
Males are 4x more likely than females to die by suicide<br />
Females attempt suicide 3x as often as males.<br />
The ratio of suicide attempts to suicide death in youth is estimated to be about 25:1, compared to about 4:1 in the elderly.</p>
<p>Suicide rates by age:<br />
&#8211; In 2014, the highest suicide rate (19.3) was among people 85 years or older.<br />
&#8211; The second highest rate (19.2) occurred in those between 45 and 64 years of age.<br />
