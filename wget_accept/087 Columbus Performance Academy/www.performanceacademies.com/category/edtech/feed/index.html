				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It isn&#8217;t a coincidence that several negative articles about charter schools and school choice have come out this week. Thousands of public school teachers <a title="Union Rally Today for Public Education" href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/1213/morningeducation12434.html">rallied yesterday</a> from New York to San Francisco to “reclaim the promise of public education.” Unions draw over $2 billion in dues from educators annually. Though membership is falling in some teacher unions,(e.g. NEA), they undoubtedly represent a powerful political presence in this country.</p>
<p>But the endless arguing between public school supporters and charter school advocates in this country isn&#8217;t helping our students achieve anything. The latest PISA results demonstrate that. Students in the US were ranked in the middle of the pack compared to other countries on this global test of achievement.</p>
<p>Slamming charter school teachers and school choice isn&#8217;t the answer. Slamming public school teachers and public schools isn&#8217;t the answer. While everyone continues the blame game, no one has agreed how to get there. We all agree on the dependent variable, which is education&#8217;s Holy Grail:<strong> raising academic achievement</strong>. But no one agrees on the independent variable(s): &#8220;<strong>how</strong>&#8220;. Raising standards alone isn&#8217;t enough. Standards are one thing. Good teaching is another.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s attack these three, straightforward, independent variables in education first, before we can actually expect to see meaningful increases in academic outcomes on a global scale:</p>
<p>1) We have to better engage students.<br />
2) We have to deliver high quality instruction.<br />
3) We have to better engage parents so they want to be involved in their child&#8217;s school.</p>
<p>Beating each other up, shaming people into working harder, and beating teachers over the head isn&#8217;t going to get the job done. Teachers and principals of all stripes should take charge of engaging kids, deliver high quality instruction, and build lasting and meaningful relationships with parents to help them want to be engaged in their child&#8217;s school. These three practices must be embraced by public and charter school educators alike.</p>
