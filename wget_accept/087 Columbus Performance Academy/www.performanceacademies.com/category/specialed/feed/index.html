				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is fitting that <em>National Charter Schools Week a</em>nd <em>Teacher Appreciation Week</em> fall during the same week this year. President Obama declared this week <strong>National Charter Schools Week, May 4-10, 2014</strong>.  Parents, students, and community members owe a great deal to successful charter schools, charter school pioneers, and charter school teachers. Arguably, the most important reason to celebrate charter schools is they offer educational choice to families otherwise restricted to a failing school because of their zip code.  Fortunately, because of early charter school pioneers and supporters, there are now over 2.5 million students enrolled in more than 6,000 charter schools nationally (<em>Source: National Association of Public Charter Schools, www.public charters.org</em>). One in twenty students now attends a public charter school. More reasons to support and celebrate charter schools this week and always are below:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Charter schools empower parents and students.</strong> Children should not be limited to a failing school because of their zip code.  Where a child lives should not determine whether a child receives a quality education.  Charters offer parents educational choice and educational mobility. Charters empower families.</p>
<p>2) <strong>One size does not fit all; different kids <span style="text-decoration: underline;">need</span> different schools.</strong>  Many traditional public schools do a decent job of educating most of their kids.  But many schools don&#8217;t, and even in high performing school districts, there are children who suffer academically, socially, emotionally, through bullying, or for other reasons. Charter schools provide a unique programmatic opportunity for students who were otherwise not always successful in their previous school and for parents who were dissatisfied in their child&#8217;s previous school. After all, if parents were satisfied with their previous school, they wouldn&#8217;t enroll their child in a charter school.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Achievement outcomes are higher in many charter schools.</strong> School choice improves student achievement. Countries like Finland, Belgium, and Australia, where parents actively choose their schools have better schools. (See &#8220;Education Myths&#8221;, Jay P. Greene).</p>
<p>4) <strong>Charter schools often provide smaller class sizes, and equally important, smaller school sizes.  </strong>Parents care about strong academics, but they care about other important factors as well.  These include safety, opportunities to be involved in their child&#8217;s education, frequent communication between home and school, and more. What smaller class sizes and smaller school sizes mean to parents are often more opportunities for parent involvement, better home and school communication, and more opportunities to focus on other facets arguably as important as academic achievement. Such factors may include character education, anti-bullying programs, school safety, niche programs (such as music, art, fitness, or technology), greater access to teachers and administrators, and stronger school/family relationships.  Moreover, parents report real and tangible benefits related to the fact that nearly everyone in the building may know their particular child, including the school administrators, support staff, and classroom teachers.</p>
<p>5) <strong>Charter schools are a bargain to the American taxpayer; charter schools do much more with less money</strong>.  Charter schools efficiently deliver quality education to students with fewer resources. In 2011, charters received $3059 less per student than traditional public schools (in urban districts, that figure is much higher), and that disparity has grown by 55% since 2007.  All states, except for Tennessee, gave more money to traditional public schools than charter schools (See: University of Arkansas Dep. of Ed Reform study). Charter schools are more economical to the taxpayer, and they are more efficient.  Most charters are unable to access local tax levy revenue like the local districts, and most receive significantly fewer dollars per pupil to educate students. Most importantly, children were never meant to receive an education through the churning of huge district wheels designed to crank out thousands of kids.  The necessary and associated burdens of huge administrative overhead costs take away from classrooms. Children are not widgets. The layers and layers of bureaucracy, policies, and systems designed to meet the needs of thousands of kids in a district or a building for a thousand students make no sense.</p>
<p>6) <strong>Charter schools are bound by the ultimate accountability consequence&#8211;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">closure</span> for poor academic outcomes tied to a limited period of time.</strong> Many behemoth, failing, traditional public school districts continue to produce high drop out rates, students who can&#8217;t read by the third grade, and poor overall academic results for kids.  Many of these schools are not safe from bullying or threats. How long should that be permitted to continue?  Should traditional districts be given two years to get it together before they close like many charters schools? Should they be given 5 years, 10 years?  What is our tolerance for public schools with no consequence for academic failure? Many have had poor outcomes for decades with no real consequence that sticks.  Charter schools are held to the highest level of accountability for poor academic outcomes. They actually have their funding taken away, and they actually close for poor performance.  More importantly, we are seeing &#8220;loft&#8221; in the charter community over time as quality charter schools continue to rise and provide more quality options for parents and students.</p>
<p>National Charter Schools Week 2014 is indeed a great time to recognize the power and opportunities inherent in charter schools for parents and students. With one million students on charter school waiting lists nationwide, it is clear parents desire educational choice.  <strong>Celebrate your charter school and your charter school teachers today!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ohio educators, charter and traditional alike, are in the throes of overseeing high stakes testing on the state mandated Ohio Achievement Assessments (OAA) this week.  Meanwhile, many are already looking ahead to next year and considering the requirements, implications, and proper implementation of the new Third Grade Reading Guarantee.</p>
<p>The new Third Grade Reading Guarantee incorporates many researched based instructional practices of which Ohio educators can be proud.  The spirit of this sweeping legislation is good and right for kids<b>.  Every child should be able to read by the time he or she completes third grade.  </b>There is ample literature and evidence to support that a child who cannot read by the end of third grade is at risk for poor achievement in other subjects, as well as dropping out of school later on (See Annie Casey Foundation study, 2013).  <a title="Early Warning Confirmed: A Research Update on Third Grade Reading" href="http:/Early Warning Confirmed: A Research Update on Third-Grade Reading http://www.aecf.org/knowledgecenter/publications.aspx?pubguid=%7B58440238-1626-476f-afda-155d2185fb3a%7D#.U1q6Bop5eJM.twitter">http://www.aecf.org/knowledgecenter/publications.aspx?pubguid=%7B58440238-1626-476f-afda-155d2185fb3a%7D#.U1q6Bop5eJM.twitter<i> Warning Confirmed—A Research Update on Third-Grade Reading by the Annie Casey Foundation, 2013</i>)</a>.</p>
<p>The parts of this new mandate that emphasize early identification, early intervention and literacy represent important shifts in the way Ohio educators think about improving reading achievement in grades K-3. Creating a safety net early and delivering quality reading interventions to the students who need it the most are critical. Too many children in Ohio can&#8217;t read by the time they finish third grade. That is unacceptable.</p>
<p>However, practical challenges loom for educators in implementing portions of the Third Grade Reading Guarantee as it currently stands.  More importantly, the implications and long term ramifications of potentially retaining hundreds or even thousands of Ohio’s third graders next year must be thoughtfully considered.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical Implementation Challenges for Schools</span></b></p>
<p>1) <b>A significant number of kindergarten students who have not attended preschool or Headstart may qualify for a reading intervention plan (known as a RIMP) once assessed on the new Kindergarten Readiness test in the fall.</b>  The early identification of language and literacy deficits in kindergarteners on this new kindergarten test represents a move in the right direction (see, Deeper Assessment for Ohio’s Kindergarteners—Columbus Dispatch, April, 2014)<br />
<a title="Deeper Assessment for Ohio's Kindergarteners" href="http:/ http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/04/25/deeper-assessment-for-kindergartners.html">http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/04/25/deeper-assessment-for-kindergartners.html</a></p>
<p>However, the need for intensive interventions for large numbers of kindergarteners under the new provisions of 3GRG may be great for some districts and charters. This means more qualified reading teachers, more qualified interventionists and support staff must be hired quickly to delivery the required interventions in the fall.  Schools will have to amp up their rosters over the summer to be prepared. This may be particularly financially burdensome for small traditional school districts or charter schools with small budgets or small numbers of staff where there is a high need for intervention.</p>
<p>2) <b>Summer enrollment efforts and building class rosters over the summer may present significant challenges for schools who accept transfer students from other districts.</b> There is no “virtual record” for students in Ohio, so when a student transfers to another district or to another charter, the new school may be unaware if the child passed the OAA in third grade or not until the sending district submits those scores in response to a records request from the new school.  Therefore, a child could potentially be placed in a 4<sup>th</sup> grade classroom, when in fact under the new 3GRG, he/she should have been retained in the 3<sup>rd</sup> grade with intensive reading interventions.  Test results for the OAA reading test that 3<sup>rd</sup> graders are taking now will not be available until mid to late June.  Grade cards alone will not have information about student passage or failure on the reading OAA.</p>
<p>3) <b>Charters in particular may face difficulties related to proper placement of students in the appropriate grade in the summertime when students transfer in from traditional districts</b>.  Many charters receive heavy enrollment over the summer. For some, summer enrollees represent about 1/3 or more of their enrollment, particularly if they are in growth mode.  Often, traditional districts do not respond to records requests from charters in July, and charters may not receive student records until fall or well after school starts.  This is particularly true for charters with early start dates. It is not unusual for a charter school office manager or principal to physically go to a district office to request records in person following multiple requests for records in the summer.  This is not a slam against traditional districts.  It is simply plainly observed experience for many Ohio charters in many districts. (This also presents significant challenges for proper implementation of IEPs for students in special education, but that is a piece for another day.)</p>
<p>4) <b>The challenges related to receiving timely records and test results may also impact a school’s ability to solidify a staff roster and to allocate appropriate classroom space</b>.  This will be particularly tricky for charters and small traditional districts to sort out before the first day of school. For example, if a charter school is full in 3rd grade and erroneously enrolls a student in 4th grade due to lack of a virtual record for a student who actually failed the 3rd grade reading OAA, it may prove challenging to pivot and move a student down to a 3rd grade class that is full after school starts.</p>
<p>5) <b>Building a calendar with a reasonable and effective number of instructional days for 2014-2015 may be challenging for traditional public and charter public schools alike</b>.  For example, our academic calendar this year reflected 28 allotted testing days for students.  Next year’s calendar has <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">78 days of testing allotted to meet the new requirements of 3GRG and the new PARCC assessments associated with the Common Core.</span></i></b>  While every child won&#8217;t necessarily test every single day, significant amounts of testing will be occurring each of those days in all of our buildings. Significantly more human and capital resources will be spent on testing. Enough said.</p>
<p>6) <b>Building a calendar with a reasonable number of PLC days may be challenging for some schools for the same reason as above.  </b>PLC days are “professional learning community days”. Effective schools use PLC meetings as a means for teachers to review student data. The purpose is to improve and inform ongoing quality instruction based on the data reviewed in the PLC.  Chipping into precious time for teachers who ought to be laser focused on their students’ academic data may be problematic for some schools.</p>
<p>7) <b>Students will be required to be held back in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade even if they are on track in math, science, and social studies for 4<sup>th</sup> grade. </b>This may be an especially “sticky wicket” for teachers, EMIS Coordinators, parents, and students on many practical levels.  The devil will be in the details of implementation, providing proper differentiated instruction across grade levels, etc.<b>  </b>Presently, there is confusing guidance about mid-year promotion policies for students.  Parents should also be considered in such a monumental decision for their child.  Presently, it appears they will not have a voice.</p>
<p><b></b><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">8) </span><b style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The big kahuna:</span></b><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">  </span><b style="line-height: 1.5em;">Not all students with disabilities will be exempt from the retention requirement of the 3GRG.</b><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">  Presently,  it appears only students with severe cognitive delays or severe disabilities will be exempt from the retention component of the 3GRG.  In practice, IEP teams are being actively discouraged from exempting students with other disabilities from the retention requirement. <strong>That means students with mild to moderate disabilities, such as dyslexia or specific learning disability (SLD) or mild forms of autism, such as Asperger’s, or students with ADHD will not be exempt from being retained if they fail the third grade Reading OAA and subsequent diagnostic tests. </strong> (Third graders will still take the old pencil and paper OAA next year for reading, but not for math.  For math, third graders will take the new PARCC assessment on the computer.)</span></p>
<p><i>Whether one thinks it is appropriate to “flunk” a student with a disability (based on the “almost old” OAA Reading test) I suppose is a personal decision.  But from my point of view as a special educator and parent of a student with a disability, the potential harm over good here is strongly tipped toward harm.</i></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical, Moral, and Research-Based Instructional Implications for Potentially Retaining  Large Numbers of Ohio Third Graders Next Year</span></b></p>
<p><b>There is no evidence that retention as an intervention improves reading achievement over time. Let me say that again.  There is no evidence that retention improves reading achievement over time.</b> As someone trained 20 years ago in the field of school psychology, it was hammered into my brain that nearly a century of research strongly indicates student retention as an intervention for reading achievement was literally 0 for retention to hundreds against.  Meta analyses of student retention studies (empirical studies of hundreds of studies over decades on one variable&#8211;retention) tell us retention doesn’t improve reading achievement.  <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In fact, the unintended consequences of retention are real and troubling, including the very thing we seek to avoid—higher drop out rates</span></b>, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not to mention poor social adjustment, poorer attendance, and more behavior problems </span></b>(see also, Annie Casey study, 2013, above). We therefore must carefully consider the long term impact of potentially retaining hundreds, perhaps thousands of third graders next year.  They may indeed become the high school dropouts of the future.</p>
<p>Today, more than 20 years later after I was in graduate school studying school psychology, special education, and school policy, it is still the position of the National Association for School Psychologists (NASP) that educators should use methods other than grade retention (and social promotion) to ensure that all students succeed (see NASP retention policy)<br />
<a title="NASP Retention Policy" href="http:/ http://www.nasponline.org/about_nasp/positionpapers/GradeRetentionandSocialPromotion.pdf ">http://www.nasponline.org/about_nasp/positionpapers/GradeRetentionandSocialPromotion.pdf .</a></p>
<p><b>Suggested alternatives to retention and social promotion from NASP include:</b></p>
<p><b>-Intensive, evidence based instruction and intervention to meet the needs of all students</b></p>
<p><b></b><b>-Equitable opportunities to learn for students from diverse backgrounds</b></p>
<p><b>-Universal screening for academic, behavioral, and social-emotional difficulties</b></p>
<p><b>-Frequent progress monitoring and evaluation of interventions</b></p>
<p>These are good things.  These components are reflected in the current 3GRG language and should be kept and implemented faithfully.  We should be proud in our state to be emphasizing these components.</p>
<p>The whole premise from NASP is that “having students repeat the same grade with the same low quality instruction will yield no improvement for the student”.  So, why would we punish kids for prior poor instruction by retaining them?  <strong>The consequence (retention) is in the wrong place, </strong>as the 3GRG currently stands.  I am proud of the track record over more than a decade in our schools of “un-retaining” students who came to us from districts having been abhorrently retained not once, but in many cases twice, and in a few cases, three times, while getting them the special education and intensive intervention services they actually needed.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, we should keep the strong language in the 3GRG in Ohio requiring early identification and early reading intervention for students who need it.  We should remove the requirement for retention altogether.</strong>  There is no basis in research to support retention as an effective intervention.  At the very least, we should exempt the retention requirement for all students with disabilities or consider retention earlier (ie kindergarten) in extreme circumstances to ensure we aren’t creating far worse problems down the road. The focus moving forward should be on the early identification and delivery of high quality instruction to all students.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indeed,</span></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <b>every child should be able to read by third grade.</b></span>  However, long term, we need to think about a consequence for <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></b> schools for failure to teach kids to read. It should be a consequence that does not punish students for their failure to read by third grade and does not risk their future by retaining them.</p>
<p>I wonder, should all schools be held to the same standard of accountability for closure (as charters) if they continue to churn out kids who can’t read? Something to think about…</p>
