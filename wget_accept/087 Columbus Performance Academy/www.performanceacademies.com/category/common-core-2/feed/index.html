				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ohio educators, charter and traditional alike, are in the throes of overseeing high stakes testing on the state mandated Ohio Achievement Assessments (OAA) this week.  Meanwhile, many are already looking ahead to next year and considering the requirements, implications, and proper implementation of the new Third Grade Reading Guarantee.</p>
<p>The new Third Grade Reading Guarantee incorporates many researched based instructional practices of which Ohio educators can be proud.  The spirit of this sweeping legislation is good and right for kids<b>.  Every child should be able to read by the time he or she completes third grade.  </b>There is ample literature and evidence to support that a child who cannot read by the end of third grade is at risk for poor achievement in other subjects, as well as dropping out of school later on (See Annie Casey Foundation study, 2013).  <a title="Early Warning Confirmed: A Research Update on Third Grade Reading" href="http:/Early Warning Confirmed: A Research Update on Third-Grade Reading http://www.aecf.org/knowledgecenter/publications.aspx?pubguid=%7B58440238-1626-476f-afda-155d2185fb3a%7D#.U1q6Bop5eJM.twitter">http://www.aecf.org/knowledgecenter/publications.aspx?pubguid=%7B58440238-1626-476f-afda-155d2185fb3a%7D#.U1q6Bop5eJM.twitter<i> Warning Confirmed—A Research Update on Third-Grade Reading by the Annie Casey Foundation, 2013</i>)</a>.</p>
<p>The parts of this new mandate that emphasize early identification, early intervention and literacy represent important shifts in the way Ohio educators think about improving reading achievement in grades K-3. Creating a safety net early and delivering quality reading interventions to the students who need it the most are critical. Too many children in Ohio can&#8217;t read by the time they finish third grade. That is unacceptable.</p>
<p>However, practical challenges loom for educators in implementing portions of the Third Grade Reading Guarantee as it currently stands.  More importantly, the implications and long term ramifications of potentially retaining hundreds or even thousands of Ohio’s third graders next year must be thoughtfully considered.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical Implementation Challenges for Schools</span></b></p>
<p>1) <b>A significant number of kindergarten students who have not attended preschool or Headstart may qualify for a reading intervention plan (known as a RIMP) once assessed on the new Kindergarten Readiness test in the fall.</b>  The early identification of language and literacy deficits in kindergarteners on this new kindergarten test represents a move in the right direction (see, Deeper Assessment for Ohio’s Kindergarteners—Columbus Dispatch, April, 2014)<br />
<a title="Deeper Assessment for Ohio's Kindergarteners" href="http:/ http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/04/25/deeper-assessment-for-kindergartners.html">http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/04/25/deeper-assessment-for-kindergartners.html</a></p>
<p>However, the need for intensive interventions for large numbers of kindergarteners under the new provisions of 3GRG may be great for some districts and charters. This means more qualified reading teachers, more qualified interventionists and support staff must be hired quickly to delivery the required interventions in the fall.  Schools will have to amp up their rosters over the summer to be prepared. This may be particularly financially burdensome for small traditional school districts or charter schools with small budgets or small numbers of staff where there is a high need for intervention.</p>
<p>2) <b>Summer enrollment efforts and building class rosters over the summer may present significant challenges for schools who accept transfer students from other districts.</b> There is no “virtual record” for students in Ohio, so when a student transfers to another district or to another charter, the new school may be unaware if the child passed the OAA in third grade or not until the sending district submits those scores in response to a records request from the new school.  Therefore, a child could potentially be placed in a 4<sup>th</sup> grade classroom, when in fact under the new 3GRG, he/she should have been retained in the 3<sup>rd</sup> grade with intensive reading interventions.  Test results for the OAA reading test that 3<sup>rd</sup> graders are taking now will not be available until mid to late June.  Grade cards alone will not have information about student passage or failure on the reading OAA.</p>
<p>3) <b>Charters in particular may face difficulties related to proper placement of students in the appropriate grade in the summertime when students transfer in from traditional districts</b>.  Many charters receive heavy enrollment over the summer. For some, summer enrollees represent about 1/3 or more of their enrollment, particularly if they are in growth mode.  Often, traditional districts do not respond to records requests from charters in July, and charters may not receive student records until fall or well after school starts.  This is particularly true for charters with early start dates. It is not unusual for a charter school office manager or principal to physically go to a district office to request records in person following multiple requests for records in the summer.  This is not a slam against traditional districts.  It is simply plainly observed experience for many Ohio charters in many districts. (This also presents significant challenges for proper implementation of IEPs for students in special education, but that is a piece for another day.)</p>
<p>4) <b>The challenges related to receiving timely records and test results may also impact a school’s ability to solidify a staff roster and to allocate appropriate classroom space</b>.  This will be particularly tricky for charters and small traditional districts to sort out before the first day of school. For example, if a charter school is full in 3rd grade and erroneously enrolls a student in 4th grade due to lack of a virtual record for a student who actually failed the 3rd grade reading OAA, it may prove challenging to pivot and move a student down to a 3rd grade class that is full after school starts.</p>
<p>5) <b>Building a calendar with a reasonable and effective number of instructional days for 2014-2015 may be challenging for traditional public and charter public schools alike</b>.  For example, our academic calendar this year reflected 28 allotted testing days for students.  Next year’s calendar has <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">78 days of testing allotted to meet the new requirements of 3GRG and the new PARCC assessments associated with the Common Core.</span></i></b>  While every child won&#8217;t necessarily test every single day, significant amounts of testing will be occurring each of those days in all of our buildings. Significantly more human and capital resources will be spent on testing. Enough said.</p>
<p>6) <b>Building a calendar with a reasonable number of PLC days may be challenging for some schools for the same reason as above.  </b>PLC days are “professional learning community days”. Effective schools use PLC meetings as a means for teachers to review student data. The purpose is to improve and inform ongoing quality instruction based on the data reviewed in the PLC.  Chipping into precious time for teachers who ought to be laser focused on their students’ academic data may be problematic for some schools.</p>
<p>7) <b>Students will be required to be held back in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade even if they are on track in math, science, and social studies for 4<sup>th</sup> grade. </b>This may be an especially “sticky wicket” for teachers, EMIS Coordinators, parents, and students on many practical levels.  The devil will be in the details of implementation, providing proper differentiated instruction across grade levels, etc.<b>  </b>Presently, there is confusing guidance about mid-year promotion policies for students.  Parents should also be considered in such a monumental decision for their child.  Presently, it appears they will not have a voice.</p>
<p><b></b><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">8) </span><b style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The big kahuna:</span></b><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">  </span><b style="line-height: 1.5em;">Not all students with disabilities will be exempt from the retention requirement of the 3GRG.</b><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">  Presently,  it appears only students with severe cognitive delays or severe disabilities will be exempt from the retention component of the 3GRG.  In practice, IEP teams are being actively discouraged from exempting students with other disabilities from the retention requirement. <strong>That means students with mild to moderate disabilities, such as dyslexia or specific learning disability (SLD) or mild forms of autism, such as Asperger’s, or students with ADHD will not be exempt from being retained if they fail the third grade Reading OAA and subsequent diagnostic tests. </strong> (Third graders will still take the old pencil and paper OAA next year for reading, but not for math.  For math, third graders will take the new PARCC assessment on the computer.)</span></p>
<p><i>Whether one thinks it is appropriate to “flunk” a student with a disability (based on the “almost old” OAA Reading test) I suppose is a personal decision.  But from my point of view as a special educator and parent of a student with a disability, the potential harm over good here is strongly tipped toward harm.</i></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical, Moral, and Research-Based Instructional Implications for Potentially Retaining  Large Numbers of Ohio Third Graders Next Year</span></b></p>
<p><b>There is no evidence that retention as an intervention improves reading achievement over time. Let me say that again.  There is no evidence that retention improves reading achievement over time.</b> As someone trained 20 years ago in the field of school psychology, it was hammered into my brain that nearly a century of research strongly indicates student retention as an intervention for reading achievement was literally 0 for retention to hundreds against.  Meta analyses of student retention studies (empirical studies of hundreds of studies over decades on one variable&#8211;retention) tell us retention doesn’t improve reading achievement.  <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In fact, the unintended consequences of retention are real and troubling, including the very thing we seek to avoid—higher drop out rates</span></b>, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not to mention poor social adjustment, poorer attendance, and more behavior problems </span></b>(see also, Annie Casey study, 2013, above). We therefore must carefully consider the long term impact of potentially retaining hundreds, perhaps thousands of third graders next year.  They may indeed become the high school dropouts of the future.</p>
<p>Today, more than 20 years later after I was in graduate school studying school psychology, special education, and school policy, it is still the position of the National Association for School Psychologists (NASP) that educators should use methods other than grade retention (and social promotion) to ensure that all students succeed (see NASP retention policy)<br />
<a title="NASP Retention Policy" href="http:/ http://www.nasponline.org/about_nasp/positionpapers/GradeRetentionandSocialPromotion.pdf ">http://www.nasponline.org/about_nasp/positionpapers/GradeRetentionandSocialPromotion.pdf .</a></p>
<p><b>Suggested alternatives to retention and social promotion from NASP include:</b></p>
<p><b>-Intensive, evidence based instruction and intervention to meet the needs of all students</b></p>
<p><b></b><b>-Equitable opportunities to learn for students from diverse backgrounds</b></p>
<p><b>-Universal screening for academic, behavioral, and social-emotional difficulties</b></p>
<p><b>-Frequent progress monitoring and evaluation of interventions</b></p>
<p>These are good things.  These components are reflected in the current 3GRG language and should be kept and implemented faithfully.  We should be proud in our state to be emphasizing these components.</p>
<p>The whole premise from NASP is that “having students repeat the same grade with the same low quality instruction will yield no improvement for the student”.  So, why would we punish kids for prior poor instruction by retaining them?  <strong>The consequence (retention) is in the wrong place, </strong>as the 3GRG currently stands.  I am proud of the track record over more than a decade in our schools of “un-retaining” students who came to us from districts having been abhorrently retained not once, but in many cases twice, and in a few cases, three times, while getting them the special education and intensive intervention services they actually needed.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, we should keep the strong language in the 3GRG in Ohio requiring early identification and early reading intervention for students who need it.  We should remove the requirement for retention altogether.</strong>  There is no basis in research to support retention as an effective intervention.  At the very least, we should exempt the retention requirement for all students with disabilities or consider retention earlier (ie kindergarten) in extreme circumstances to ensure we aren’t creating far worse problems down the road. The focus moving forward should be on the early identification and delivery of high quality instruction to all students.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indeed,</span></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <b>every child should be able to read by third grade.</b></span>  However, long term, we need to think about a consequence for <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></b> schools for failure to teach kids to read. It should be a consequence that does not punish students for their failure to read by third grade and does not risk their future by retaining them.</p>
<p>I wonder, should all schools be held to the same standard of accountability for closure (as charters) if they continue to churn out kids who can’t read? Something to think about…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It isn&#8217;t a coincidence that several negative articles about charter schools and school choice have come out this week. Thousands of public school teachers <a title="Union Rally Today for Public Education" href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/1213/morningeducation12434.html">rallied yesterday</a> from New York to San Francisco to “reclaim the promise of public education.” Unions draw over $2 billion in dues from educators annually. Though membership is falling in some teacher unions,(e.g. NEA), they undoubtedly represent a powerful political presence in this country.</p>
<p>But the endless arguing between public school supporters and charter school advocates in this country isn&#8217;t helping our students achieve anything. The latest PISA results demonstrate that. Students in the US were ranked in the middle of the pack compared to other countries on this global test of achievement.</p>
<p>Slamming charter school teachers and school choice isn&#8217;t the answer. Slamming public school teachers and public schools isn&#8217;t the answer. While everyone continues the blame game, no one has agreed how to get there. We all agree on the dependent variable, which is education&#8217;s Holy Grail:<strong> raising academic achievement</strong>. But no one agrees on the independent variable(s): &#8220;<strong>how</strong>&#8220;. Raising standards alone isn&#8217;t enough. Standards are one thing. Good teaching is another.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s attack these three, straightforward, independent variables in education first, before we can actually expect to see meaningful increases in academic outcomes on a global scale:</p>
<p>1) We have to better engage students.<br />
2) We have to deliver high quality instruction.<br />
3) We have to better engage parents so they want to be involved in their child&#8217;s school.</p>
<p>Beating each other up, shaming people into working harder, and beating teachers over the head isn&#8217;t going to get the job done. Teachers and principals of all stripes should take charge of engaging kids, deliver high quality instruction, and build lasting and meaningful relationships with parents to help them want to be engaged in their child&#8217;s school. These three practices must be embraced by public and charter school educators alike.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the battle rages to close the &#8220;learning gap&#8221; for many students, it&#8217;s not enough to be smart.  I&#8217;ve said it before, there are plenty of smart, mean people in the world, and not enough smart, nice people. It&#8217;s time to have a sense of urgency about<em><strong> &#8220;closing the character gap&#8221;. </strong> </em></p>
<p>Here are five things you can do now to teach character and prosocial behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MAKE A COMMITMENT; HAVE A PLAN</strong></li>
<li><strong>HAVE STUDENTS START A WEEKLY CHARACTER JOURNAL</strong></li>
<li><strong>USE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO SEEK IDEAS</strong></li>
<li><strong>MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH YOUR STUDENTS</strong></li>
<li><strong>REWARD, CELEBRATE, AND REINFORCE STUDENTS&#8217; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I. MAKE A COMMITMENT; HAVE A PLAN</p>
<p>In order to teach character effectively, you just need to start! Make the commitment to start each day with a character lesson.  Start with just one character trait you want to teach.  Include it in your lesson plan.  Allocate a block of time each morning.  If it&#8217;s not in writing, it might not happen.</p>
<p>II. HAVE STUDENTS START A WEEKLY CHARACTER JOURNAL</p>
<p>Start each week with a weekly character quote by a famous person of high character.  Have your students expand on that by writing each day in their journal what the quote means to them.  Assign activities related to the quote.</p>
<p>III. USE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO FIND IDEAS</p>
<p>Start every morning with developmentally appropriate (and fun!) character education activities.  Search Pinterest, Teachers Helping Teachers, and other sites for grade level character lessons aligned to the Common Core.</p>
<p>IV. MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH YOUR STUDENTS</p>
<p>Share something about yourself.  Talk to them about your experiences.  Meet them at their level, and by revealing something personal about yourself (appropriately), you show them you are human and you care. Sharing how you overcame a personal obstacle makes you &#8220;real&#8221;.</p>
<p>V. REWARD, CELEBRATE, AND REINFORCE STUDENTS&#8217; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS</p>
<p>When your kids overcome a learning block, when you observe them sharing, when you see them solve a problem or show respect, PRAISE them!  Have character bulletin boards, celebrate &#8220;citizen of the month&#8221;, and character walls on display in your school building.  Create a<em><strong> &#8220;culture of character&#8221;</strong></em> in your school.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Even though schools are laser focused on amping up for the Common Core, are we forgetting something?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The Common Core debates are heating up.  The push for more and better professional development on the Common Core State Standards for teachers and administrators forges full speed ahead.  Charters and traditional public school districts alike are bearing down on teachers to learn everything they can about the CCSS as schools attempt to align their curricula, adjust their instructional strategies, and become poised to successfully compete on brand new high stakes tests that have yet to been seen.</p>
<p>All that, and charters and districts will soon line up to be ranked by new state report cards in many states which will sort them A-F on a variety of standards based in large part on the outcomes of these largely unseen high stakes tests.  (Charters will bear the ultimate accountability responsibility-risk of closure for failing to measure up).  Meantime, policy analysts and educators are debating about whether American students lag behind in academics as much as some purport, and if those achievement gaps stem from poverty or in fact from poor teaching  (see <a title="Finn &amp; Petrilli: 6 Reasons Why Conservatives Should Back Common Core" href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130922/OPINION05/309220104" target="_blank">Petrilli</a> and <a title="Why I Oppose Common Core Standards" href="http://m.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/02/26/why-i-oppose-common-core-standards-ravitch/" target="_blank">Ravitch</a> and <a title="Common Core is not What Its Supporters Claim it Is" href="http://www.unionleader.com/article/20130725/OPINION02/130729573/1009/OPINION01" target="_blank">McCluskey</a>).  Big thinkers are wondering whether we&#8217;ve even identified the correct dependent and independent variables in myriad of research (achievement as a dependent variable and poverty, for example and a host of others, as independent variables-see <a title="A Chance for a New Fordham" href="http://jaypgreene.com/2013/11/04/a-chance-for-a-new-fordham" target="_blank">Jay Greene</a>).  Meantime still, parents of the very children we all seek to serve, as well as the teachers in the trenches, are trying to make sense of it all. Oh, and yes, technology&#8211;remember, in the midst of this education revolution (which is what it is, don&#8217;t think otherwise), you ought to be flipping your classroom!  While the latter may be an exaggeration, it&#8217;s not entirely a stretch.  There is an overall expectation that districts should be offering students at least some meaningful blended learning experiences along the spectrum of instructional tools aligned with the Common Core, and most &#8220;good districts&#8221; and &#8220;good charters&#8221; are complying.</p>
<p>The Common Core arguably has many commendable things in it, though the devil is always in the details of implementation.  The quest to increase academic achievement is a noble pursuit.  As part of the school choice and reform movement for 15 years, there are many aspects of reform I embrace.   Yet no one I know is excited about how CCSS was rolled out and how schools were asked to support it without empirical data.  Many complain there wasn&#8217;t full disclosure of where it came from.  Regardless, no one can definitively say whether or not the implementation of these standards (the independent variable) will have a positive effect on education&#8217;s Holy Grail&#8211;the dependent variable, which is increasing academic achievement. (Of course, neither did NCLB).  Obviously, in my organization, we&#8217;ve committed over a million dollars to Common Core aligned curriculum and teacher training in the grandest of hopes that it will.  Yet the fact remains, the standards themselves are untested.</p>
<p>But I want to refocus the conversation on something we as educators have known for centuries.  <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>While the war on closing the achievement gap rages, what about Character Education?</strong></span></em>  While it ought to be a requisite goal for schools to turn out smart kids,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong> it’s not enough to be smart</strong></em></span>. There are arguably plenty of smart, mean people in the world, and not enough smart, nice people.  Moreover, there is plenty of empirical research that demonstrates success in college and success in the workplace are largely dependent on social skills, compassion, character, the ability to get along with people, not to mention overall &#8220;grit&#8221;.</p>
<p>It struck me during a talk by a leading expert on school violence last year in Boston that <em><strong>we need to spend way more time on character development</strong></em>.  These are indeed skills that can be and must be taught. We know that bullying is pervasive in schools, and we know that school violence is only on the rise. We also know that perpetrators of school violence were more frequently bullied in school than their peers.  We know that future perpetrators of school violence may be victims of repetitive bullying right now.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t we owe it to our children and to their future to teach them empathy, kindness, forgiveness, courage and respect?  Can&#8217;t we meet them at their humanity and bridge cultural and socioeconomic differences and create communities based on our commonalities as human beings?  What could be more important than molding and shaping future citizens of tomorrow?  I submit that at this time and in this place, nothing is more urgent.</p>
