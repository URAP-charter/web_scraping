				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="dropcap dropcap3">D</span>etermination is the core character trait for the month of March. Whether it be graduating or accomplishing some other goal, determination is what enables students to hold fast and live out the other virtues. </span></p>
<p><b>What is Determination?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposing to accomplish the right goal at the right time regardless of the opposition.</span></p>
<p><b>Where does the word come from?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Word etymology:  Determination originates from the Latin </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">de</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; meaning, “to limit or fix completely” and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">terminare</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meaning “to finish or bring to completion.” Determination is recognizing or pursuing the goal that will bring a project to completion. </span></p>
<p><b>Determination in Action: Elizabeth Blackwell</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2149" src="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Elizabeth_Blackwell_NLM_02-232x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="257" srcset="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Elizabeth_Blackwell_NLM_02-232x300.jpg 232w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Elizabeth_Blackwell_NLM_02-768x994.jpg 768w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Elizabeth_Blackwell_NLM_02-792x1024.jpg 792w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Elizabeth_Blackwell_NLM_02-696x900.jpg 696w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Elizabeth_Blackwell_NLM_02-1068x1382.jpg 1068w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Elizabeth_Blackwell_NLM_02-325x420.jpg 325w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" />In 1847, a time before women could vote, it took immense determination for Elizabeth Blackwell to become the first woman to receive her medical degree in the United States. While other women had practiced medicine in the past, none had ever completed formal training and received a medical degree. Elizabeth’s determination was not driven by a desire to prove a point, but by the realization that she could help a lot of people as a doctor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While still a 24-year-old schoolteacher, she visited a friend dying of cancer. Her friend confided in Elizabeth that her suffering would have been made easier if she had had a female doctor who might have lived with some of the issues she was facing. She asked Elizabeth to consider devoting her talent to serving women like her. After struggling with the idea for some time, Elizabeth made up her mind. She was going to dedicate herself to improving medical treatment for women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her first obstacle to completing medical school was money. Even then, medical school was<br />
expensive.  To raise the funds she needed, Elizabeth continued to teach. When she was not teaching, she studied medical books with the help of sympathetic physicians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After raising the funds, Elizabeth faced a new challenge. No medical school would accept a woman. She received 29 rejection letters before she finally was accepted to Geneva Medical <img class="size-medium wp-image-2151 alignright" src="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Geneva_medical_college-300x207.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="207" srcset="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Geneva_medical_college-300x207.jpg 300w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Geneva_medical_college-100x70.jpg 100w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Geneva_medical_college-218x150.jpg 218w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Geneva_medical_college.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />College in western New York. The dean of the school had put her acceptance up to a vote by the all-male student body. Thinking it was a joke, they voted yes unanimously.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth started medical school in the fall of 1847. Gradually gaining the respect of her classmates, 28-year-old Elizabeth graduated with her medical degree in 1849 at the top of her class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had made history and received her medical license, but she was unable to find a hospital that would allow her to work as a physician. Still determined, Elizabeth sailed to Europe to find work. Rejected from hospitals in England, the country of her birth, she finally found work at La Maternite, a hospital in Paris. While she was only allowed to work as a student midwife, Elizabeth was resolved to not let it keep her from pursuing her goal to be recognized as the physician she was trained to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1851, she finally returned home to New York City, and worked to open her own practice. She opened a clinic in the slums of New York City with the help of her sister Emily, who, inspired by Elizabeth, earned her medical degree in 1853. Eventually the two raised enough support to open The New York Infirmary for Women and Children, which still operates today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2150" src="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Elizabeth_blackwell_stamp-266x300.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="165" />Gaining recognition in the areas of gynecology and pediatrics, Elizabeth spent a year lecturing in the United Kingdom and became the first woman to have her name on the British medical register. Recognizing the growing interest of women to pursue medical careers, Elizabeth dreamed of starting a women’s medical college, which she launched after the Civil War ended through her New York Infirmary for Women and Children. It was one of the first medical schools in the U.S to require four years of study. While she faced considerable opposition throughout her career, Elizabeth gained great respect for her work. Beyond opening the medical field for women, Elizabeth also made significant contributions to preventative medicine and sanitation. When she died in 1910, more than 7,000 licensed women physicians were practicing in the United States. </span></p>
<p><b>Quotes From Elizabeth Blackwell</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is not easy to be a pioneer but oh, it is fascinating! I would not trade one moment, even the worst moment, for all the riches in the world.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Elizabeth Blackwell</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea of winning a doctor&#8217;s degree gradually assumed the aspect of a great moral struggle, and the moral fight possessed immense attraction for me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Elizabeth Blackwell</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of us can know what we are capable of until we are tested.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Elizabeth Blackwell</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noble work! Welcome struggle, suffering, torture even, if our path lie through them; struggle will be bliss, suffering will be angels&#8217; food, if only so we may accomplish our destiny, and fulfill a Divine use.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”       &#8211; Elizabeth Blackwell</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My mind is fully made up. I have not the slightest hesitation on the subject; the thorough study of medicine, I am quite resolved to go through with. The horrors and disgusts I have no doubt of vanquishing. I have overcome stronger distastes than any that now remain, and feel fully equal to the contest.” &#8211; Elizabeth Blackwell</span></p>
<p><b>Discussion Questions</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Blackwell faced great opposition. How was she able to accomplish her goals?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some of the positive effects of Elizabeth Blackwell’s determination? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determination is proposing to accomplish the right goal at the right time regardless of the opposition. What does right goals mean? What does right time mean? Can some goals be wrong goals? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some of your goals? How can you practice determination to help you accomplish those goals? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some challenges you face in meeting your goals? What are some things you can do to overcome those challenges?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are people you know who have demonstrated determination? How can you imitate them?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the benefits of determination? </span></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="dropcap dropcap3">Y</span>arely Gomez wants to go to nursing school after she graduates from high school. However, this senior at Premier High School of Edinburg Career and Technology Education Center is getting a head start by completing a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) program at her high school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By completing the CNA program at her high school free of cost and taking the state certification test, Yarely will be able to work in the nursing field and gain helpful experience before she starts a registered nursing (RN) program. Since Premier High School of Edinburg CTE Center incorporated the CNA program into its Health Science CTE program fall of 2016, eight students have already received their CNA certification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlos Cavazos, the school’s project planner, first brought the program to the school due to the increase demand for CNAs. He hopes by providing them with exposure to the medical field at no financial cost to them, students will be able to decide if they want to pursue a career in medicine before they commit to the cost of higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The program at Premier is unique because we are a small school so we can offer this opportunity to a higher percentage of interested students. We have had students come to our school because they wanted to be part of a CNA program, but they were overlooked for the opportunity at their other school,” said Mr. Cavazos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The class consists of 100 hours of classes for four weeks taught by a teacher from </span><a href="http://mcallencareersinstitute.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAllen Careers Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and two weeks of clinicals at a nearby nursing home. Once they complete the program they take a state test and receive their certification. Two students from the most recent graduating class are not only working as nursing assistants at a nursing home, but they are also in a RN program at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yarely likes the CNA program at Premier because it is increasing her understanding of nursing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The classes are very helpful and easy to follow. In addition to learning a lot of medical terminology, I really like how we are building the skills of how to handle a patient. We covered how we should speak to patients. It can be different particularly when they are from different cultures. It is really helpful when you are actually working,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="http://www.allnursingschools.com/certified-nursing-assistant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNA job</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> covers a wide range of hands-on activities, from dressing wounds and taking blood pressure to  feeding patients and assisting with medical procedures. The practical experience a CNA receives not only helps students applying for nursing school but also provides them with background knowledge that will help them do well in nursing school. Financially it can also benefit nursing students by providing them with job opportunities while they are in school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Yarely completes her RN degree, she wants to work at a </span><a href="http://southtexasbehavioralhealthcenter.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">behavioral center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is a way I can give back and help people for the better. There are many people out there who need help. It is enjoyable to know you are working to help fill that need,” Yarely said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to providing students with opportunities in health science, Premier High School of Edinburg CTE Center offers CTE opportunities in Law, Public Safety, Corrections and Security; Arts, Audiovisual Technology and Communications; and Business, Management and Finance.  Mr. Cavazos is looking to add additional certifications in the different CTE opportunities the school provides. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="dropcap dropcap3">D</span>eveloping lifelong learners is one of ResponsiveEd’s goals. Strong teachers play a vital role in meeting this goal. This year ResponsiveEd’s content directors launched the Master Teacher Program as a way to support teachers in the classroom and make sure students are receiving the instruction they need to be successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ResponsiveEd’s History director John Heitzenrater believes the program will help students by providing teachers with the support they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we were hired as content directors, our first consideration was how to support teachers to make sure the curriculum is being utilized to develop students. We looked for teachers who love their craft and their students, which results in strong student performance,” said Mr. Heitzenrater. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The content directors from the four core subject areas of English Language Arts &amp; Reading (ELAR), History, Math and Science, all looked for exemplary teachers in their subject area and grade level. They grouped the grade levels into Kindergarten through second grade, third through fifth grade, sixth through eighth grade and high school. Every grade group should have a master teacher for each subject area in ResponsiveEd’s Houston and Dallas hubs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master teacher Chrenda Dotsy, a K-2 history teacher at Clay Classical Academy, says the program is particularly helpful for new teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a teacher, I see this program as really helpful. I have been teaching at Clay Classical Academy for seven years, and in the process I have had a chance to hear many of the challenges teachers face. I really like being able to help because everything I have learned personally didn’t come from a book, but from other teachers. Receiving answers from someone who is in the classroom as well really helps and encourages questions,” said Ms. Dotsy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joy Morris, ResponsiveEd’s director of K-12 English Language Arts &amp; Reading, believes the program not only makes sure teachers are receiving the support they need, but also ensures teacher quality in all of ResponsiveEd’s schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Master Teacher Program is just a way for us as a district to identify teachers who are doing things the way we intend all teachers to do them. Each student is different, and a good teacher has to meet each of their individual needs. That is not easy. From our perspective, we are taking these teachers and allowing them to help us grow other teachers. In education, we are about growing students on a campus level so I would like to view this as an opportunity for us to grow our teachers and help them be the best teachers they can be,” said Ms. Morris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Morris says her teachers have extensive classroom experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I looked for individuals who are success driven and have results in their classrooms. They are following the research best practices, there is high engagement in their classroom, they are utilizing the the curriculum we give them and they are facilitating learning on all levels in their classroom,” said Ms. Morris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers with questions about anything from classroom management or grading to content or scope and sequence can contact a Master Teacher. They also can sit in on a master teacher’s classroom or have a master teacher visit to give them pointers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have some pretty serious curriculum. Good instruction is vital to student performance. We have a lot of great teachers and we hope this program will provide them with the support they need to continue growing,” said Heitzenrater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of master teachers, the content directors also hold regular video conferencing meetings to offer support on anything from model lessons to classroom management. Always the goal is to provide the support and resources teachers need to grow successful adults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately all support for teachers really benefits students in a classroom. If teachers aren’t clear on how or what to teach or they leave some key content out, then later down the road that missing information can cause gaps in a student’s education,” said Ms. Dotsy.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="dropcap dropcap3">C</span>an equality pose a threat to liberty? It is a big question, but one Kerighan Wheeler, a senior at Founders Classical Academy of Lewisville found intriguing and decided to address in her senior thesis. Drawing from Alexis de Tocqueville’s “The Old Regime and the Revolution” and parts of “Democracy in America,” she concluded equality that is only partial can pose a real threat to liberty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Kerighan, all seniors at ResponsiveEd’s Founders Classical Academies write and present a senior thesis, which allows them to assess what they have learned and direct the skills they have developed to a particular idea and book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant Headmaster Alex Misko said the senior thesis is the culmination of students’ work as it pushes them to become independent learners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would describe senior thesis as a capstone to the curriculum over all. It provides the opportunity for a student to use the skills they have developed on a question of great importance to themselves, but also to man in general. As a teacher it is enjoyable to see a student develop a love for their topic during the project,” said Mr. Misko.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the summer before their senior year, students pick a classical text addressing a question of fundamental human importance in the western tradition to study in depth. From philosophy and science to ethics and literature, students are free to choose any subject area to explore. During the fall semester after reading, outlining and summarizing the work, students pick a question of great traditional importance as a theme. Applying the theme to the text, students either use the text to explore the question or use the question to unlock the meaning of the text.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After formulating their idea in an abstract, students begin the work on writing a 12-15 page thesis. During the second semester of their senior year, they give a 15 minute oral presentation before a panel, which is open to the public. The panel, consisting of the thesis teacher, a thesis advisor and an additional teacher, asks the student questions for 10 minutes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the process, students have the guidance of both Chris Kirk, who teaches the senior thesis class, and a mentor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mentors are always there to get them back on track if they stray a little. To some extent they serve as secondary sources. The goal, by the time they graduate, is to have students who can tackle a big work or idea on their own. You never know what a student is capable of until you give them a little latitude,” said Mr. Kirk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Topics can take on a wide range of issues. Last year a student wrote on bricolage explanation of evolutionary change through epigenetics. This year one student explored the effect of music on emotions. In addition to allowing students to pursue their particular interests, the wide range of topics also allow the mentors an opportunity to sharpen their own understanding of topics as they work closely with students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of our students pick books they have read before in a class that they may have lingering questions about or one that they particularly enjoyed. Many of our teachers can also be found after school talking with our students discussing class texts. I know that many of our senior thesis projects have been born out of those after class discussions,” said Mr. Kirk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year senior Holly Tidman explored the challenges Darwin’s theory of evolution poses to William Paley’s natural theology in her thesis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought it would make a good senior thesis topic because I knew I wanted to do something with science, but I don’t think it should be limited to a lab. I wanted to work on something that was interdisciplinary so I combined science with theology,” said Holly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Brogden, Founders’ high school science teacher, served as her senior thesis mentor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am a chaperone of ideas. I proofread and check grammar, but I also give them challenging ideas, texts and articles that push their brains. I was really proud of Holly. She was provocative, clear and direct, not vague or general. She had really worked through the ideas and arrived at a conclusion,” said Mr. Brogden. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond creating a bonding experience for all the seniors, the opportunity to work closely with a particular teacher, working within a less rigid structure, and taking full responsibility for a work prepares students for the transition from high school to college. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students really remember their senior thesis. I had alumni come back last year to talk to our current senior thesis class. I kept hearing the same thing: after senior thesis, college is easy. I wouldn’t say college is easy, but I would say that what they receive here puts them in a good position to be able to handle college level work,” said Mr. Kirk.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="dropcap dropcap3">F</span>rom STEM to classical and early college programs, ResponsiveEd values providing all families with real school choices for their students, while focusing on providing a virtue-based education with a content-rich curriculum. Reading quality literature is an important element of a content-rich curriculum.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joy Morris, ResponsiveEd’s Director of K-12 English Language Arts and Reading (ELAR), says  an ELAR program can be judged as content-rich based on the works students are studying.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What genres are the students studying? Does it include novels, poetry, nonfiction and short stories? What authors? Even more important are the lessons students are learning once they have read those authors and genres. What can they take away from them? How does it contribute to their development as human beings?” said Ms. Morris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While ResponsiveEd’s different school programs may have differences in ELAR content, each school seeks to build a literacy in literature and engage students in timeless ideas. Founders Classical Academy of Lewisville Headmaster Jason Caros believes the content students read is essential as they transition from learning to read to reading to learn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At Founders, we intentionally nourish our children on rich literature that includes classic fairy tales, nursery rhymes, novels and poems. Titles range from ‘Cinderella’ and ‘Little House in the Big Woods’ to the ‘Iliad’ and ‘Crime and Punishment.’ These stories are considered classics because they are written in noble language that help to stir the moral imagination, they teach readers important lessons about what it means to be human, and they pass the test of time. By engaging in classics, our students experience the best of what has been written, they can engage in what has been called ‘the great conversation,’ and they develop high standards by which to judge other books of literature,&#8221; said Mr. Caros.</span></p>
<h5><b>English Language Arts and Reading Incorporates Character Education</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a text-driven curriculum, character education has a natural place in a content-rich program. A broad range of reading naturally allows for extensive character analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ask teachers to think about how they can bring virtue into the conversation. Just talking about the characters in each day’s reading provides lots of material. Were the characters trustworthy? Were they kind? Were they honest? It is simply a natural part of the program,” said Ms. Morris.</span></p>
<h5><b>Helping Your Students Develop into Lifelong Readers</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison Leonard, a third grade ELAR teacher at Corinth Classical Academy, has experience teaching at a traditional public school as well as home schooling, and she believes a content-rich approach helps keep students engaged in the classroom</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our program builds in vocabulary, recitations, penmanship, poetry, literature and grammar all together and I think it really helps keep students engaged and excited. They work independently, but they also come together to share their writing and ideas with the class, which results in lots of positive peer encouragement. One thing they have really been excited about this year is realizing what they study in ELAR connects to things on their other classes such as history or science,” said Ms. Leonard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading and writing are essential communication skills students will use throughout their lives. Making sure each student is reaching their reading and writing potential is each teacher’s goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our teachers are very cognizant of the fact that we are creating lifelong learners because reading and writing skills will take them through their whole life. It is all about making sure your classes are fun and engaging the students interests, but also making sure your lesson are designed so that your students get the most of them,” said Ms. Morris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond engaging classrooms, a content rich curriculum and dedicated teachers, parent involvement is an essential element to a child&#8217;s reading success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parental involvement brings a delight to children’s homework. Students enjoy spending time with their parent. When you read with them, encourage them to read, or show you enjoy reading, it is easy for your child to fall in love with reading,” said Ms. Leonard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond reading outside of class, Ms. Morris recommends asking questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ask your children daily what they read about in class. What did they learn about those characters? What did they learn in the reading selection? What has it motivated them to do?” said Ms. Morris. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="dropcap dropcap3">E</span>very year since he was six, Micah Pinson, a seventh grader at Corinth Classical Academy, has collected and donated toys to the </span><a href="http://www.tsrhc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In recognition of his volunteer work, he has been selected to receive the 2017 Prudential Spirit of Community Award on March 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I was six my dad and I had a talk about how the hospital is a non-profit. They did so much for me and thousands of other families so we decided to give back somehow,” said Micah. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Micah was born, he was missing three fingers on his left hand. His parents were advised to take him to the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children as they specialize in orthopedics. Through the hospital Micah received two hand surgeries for free and also participated in three hand camps where he heard from former patients who had hand differences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micah’s mother, Angela Pinson, says the support they received from the hospital helped them navigate through the challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As parents we were shocked and scared. He was six or eight weeks when we first brought him to the hospital. We were still very much in shock. They were great for us as parents in helping us and encouraging us through support groups because you really don’t know what to expect. We are fortunate with Micah that we don’t need those support groups anymore, but as a young parent that was wonderful,” said Mrs. Pinson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grateful for all the support they had received from the hospital free of cost, Micah’s father Richard Pinson wanted to find a way for Micah to give back. They found their answer in a toy drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anytime you ever go to the hospital for a doctor’s visit, you receive a toy.  In 2001 the toys shelves were almost completely bare,” said Mr. Pinson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the donations of boxes from Lowe&#8217;s, wrapping paper from Costco, and the time of local high school students to wrap the boxes, Micah started </span><a href="http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2011/12/16/caring-2nd-grader-collecting-toys-sick-kids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his toy drive.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went to businesses all around, apartments, communities, Costco and Starbucks. I went up and asked if we could put a box there where customers could see the box and drop a toy in. A lot of them said, sure, that would be great. So we would put a box there the Monday after Thanksgiving and a week before Christmas we would start picking them up,” said Micah. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2118" src="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016-300x225.jpg" width="240" height="180" srcset="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016-300x225.jpg 300w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016-768x576.jpg 768w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016-80x60.jpg 80w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016-265x198.jpg 265w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016-696x522.jpg 696w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016-560x420.jpg 560w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a>Over the years their toy drive has grown. This year they filled an 18-wheeler with 10,000 toys. Since they started, they have collected 25,000 toys. Collecting toys in an area that ranges from Denton to DeSoto, Micah’s toy drive is the largest single toy donation the hospital receives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People have been very generous. Often they are more willing to say yes to a kid and say no to me,” said Mr. Pinson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant director Christina Wallace at Corinth Classical Academy knew that Micah dedicated many hours of his year to the toy drive so she recommended he apply for the </span><a href="https://spirit.prudential.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prudential Spirit of Community Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is United States’ largest youth recognition program based on volunteer community service only. Micah applied, but didn’t think much of it until he was told in February that he had been selected by the program as Texas top middle school volunteer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A high school student and a middle school student are selected from each state to receive the award, which includes $1,000, an engraved silver medallion and an all-expenses-paid trip to Washington D.C for the national recognition events in May. From the 102 state honorees, five middle school student and five high school students will be named America’s top youth volunteers for 2017. With over 129,000 applications, Micah was surprised he received the award, but he is also excited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am really excited to go to Washington D.C. I have been once before, but I want to go see everything we missed. There will be a famous person speaking at the banquet in D.C, and I am really hoping it is either Ezekiel Elliott or Dak Prescott. I’m a really big sports fan and that would be incredible,” said Micah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recognition he has been receiving recently, Micah’s focus remains bringing joy to the kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Each year they will allow me to present a kid with a toy I picked out. I just love seeing their<img class="alignright wp-image-2117 size-medium" src="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2015-A-e1488229813924-300x267.jpg" width="300" height="267" srcset="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2015-A-e1488229813924-300x267.jpg 300w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2015-A-e1488229813924-768x683.jpg 768w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2015-A-e1488229813924-1024x911.jpg 1024w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2015-A-e1488229813924-696x619.jpg 696w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2015-A-e1488229813924-1068x950.jpg 1068w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2015-A-e1488229813924-472x420.jpg 472w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2015-A-e1488229813924.jpg 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> faces because there is such joy and happiness. It is incredible that we are in a hospital and people are happy. They may be sick, but they don’t feel like they are nothing. I like giving the toys and showing them that they are something. It is an incredible experience,” said Micah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he has gotten older, Micah has presented to the board of director’s wives breakfasts at the George Bush Library, CEOs and city officials. Through the process he has become more comfortable with public speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I learned to talk to a lot of people at one time. I love sharing my story. I love talking about the hospital and telling other people what they have done for me. The hospital does tours and I like to tell people to just go one time to see what they do.,” said Micah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to his volunteer work, Micah plays sports for Corinth Classical Academy and serves as the vice-president of student council. Campus director, Amie Giacumakis says one of the school’s key goals is to teach students character so that they can be responsible citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Micah displays the virtues of philanthropy and that is something we seek to instill in all of our scholars. He is a leader on campus and obviously in our community and we are thrilled that he is being recognized for all of his hard work,” said Ms. Giacumakis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micah plans to continue his toy drive. He also looks forward to sharing his story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am so fortunate, some kids have lost arms and legs. I have a thumb and a finger, which is really more than I need. It is very helpful. All the kids at Scottish Rite are so amazing. I have learned that you can always give back,” said Micah.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="dropcap dropcap3">A</span>t the end of every semester students and faculty from <a href="https://responsiveed.com/foundersleander/" target="_blank">Founders Classical Academy of Leander </a>gather for two days to compete in and cheer on their classmates in the Archer Games. Created in May of 2015 as a culminating part of the school’s house system, the games are now an anticipated part of the school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headmaster Kathleen O’Toole believes the games help encourage a positive school spirit across the grades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is really about building relationships between students in the houses. During the games, their house’s reputation is on the line. They have to step up to compete or cheer their housemates on as they represent the school,” said Dr. O’Toole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Archer Games first evolved from the school’s </span><a href="https://responsiveed.com/blog/responsiveed-schools-implement-house-system-to-encourage-camaraderie-and-friendly-competition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">house system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a way to create school community, the school sorts students at the end of sixth grade into one of the<a href="https://responsiveed.com/foundersleander/house-system/" target="_blank"> six houses</a>: Herodotus, Shakespeare, Beethoven, da Vinci, Newton and Euclid. Supported by a teacher mentor and a head boy and girl, students stay in their assigned house until they graduate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While only the seventh through twelfth grade students compete, the lower school students also come to cheer on their favorite house. Since siblings are all sorted into the same house, some of the younger students know which house to cheer on. Sixth grader Sofia Williams doesn’t have any older siblings, but she still enjoys cheering on all of the houses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like watching them compete because it is really cool to see everyone from the oldest to the youngest competing. You get to think about what you might possibly do when it is your turn. It is really exciting. I think it also helps you bond together from all grades, and you get to meet new people,” said Sofia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The academic portion of the competition is set up as an arena-style quiz bowl.<a href="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/103154.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-2113 size-medium" src="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/103154-300x169.jpg" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/103154-300x169.jpg 300w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/103154-768x432.jpg 768w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/103154-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/103154-696x392.jpg 696w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/103154-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/103154-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> Teachers submit questions based on what the students have studied over the semester. From art and Latin to math and literature, all of the subjects are represented. Students have 30 seconds to submit their answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With questions specific to each grade, house mentor of Herodotus, Stephanie McIntyre says there is a real strategy to the games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The questions are often grade-level specific. So it is important to have an ‘expert’ from each grade level. However, you also want students who are strong in the different subjects. I try to balance all that with making sure all of my students have a chance to compete because in the end it is about fun and coming together as a team,” said Dr. McIntyre. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Natasha De Virgilio from the house of Euclid says the academic games are her area of strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really like the competition because you get to see the strengths of other students. During the school year you get caught up in your own classes, but the games give you the chance to see there are a lot of other kids here who are also learning a lot of cool things,” said Natasha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year the athletics segment of the games changes. From basketball to ultimate frisbee and dodgeball, they look for games that can include most of the students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In recent years we have tended away from traditional sports. Since it is really about that camaraderie, sports that level the playing field across the grades are great. In this year’s dodgeball competition it wasn’t the athletes who lasted until the end. It was a little seventh grader against a senior who had never played sports for the school. It was wonderful to see everyone on their feet cheering those two on,” said Dr. O’Toole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year was math teacher Cameron Starc’s first experience with the games. New to the school, he has not yet been assigned to a house, but he appreciates the spirit of the games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a healthy competition is really good. To have an academic and athletic component is important. As a high-level math teacher there are certain things you can&#8217;t really spend a lot of time on during the school year. So when you have a competition that allows students to approach a challenging question without background knowledge, it motivates them to learn more,” said Mr. Starc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond encouraging students to learn, the Archer Games have helped the school build a strong community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it is worth taking two days to build the camaraderie. School is not just about academics. It is good for kids to learn at an young age to be part of something bigger than themselves and to work with other people. I see in our school such a positive culture and I think it is because of the games. No one group or event can unite the kids as well as the Archer Games do,” said Dr. McIntyre. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="dropcap dropcap3">T</span>his year was Corinth Classical Academy’s first time competing in </span><a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/about-fll"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIRST LEGO League</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but that didn’t stop one of their teams, The Crash, from taking home the trophy at their first competition. Beyond their robotics skills, the students were judged on their research and presentation skills as well as the character they displayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Cook, wife of ResponsiveEd CEO Chuck Cook, introduced FIRST LEGO to Corinth Classical Academy after seeing her own son’s success in the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“FIRST LEGO League is not just any robotics program. It stands out as relevant to a classical school because there are three components. The most obvious is the robotics aspect, but it also has a research and a </span><a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/flljr/core-values"><span style="font-weight: 400;">core values</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> component that are equally as important. As part of the research, the students have to present it to the local community, which fits really well with classical education because it goes beyond the school to impacting the world around you,” said Mrs. Cook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the character and research components, campus director Amie Giacumakis believes the program adds a positive Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) component to the school’s curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a classical school, but we also want to offer students a chance to explore STEM. The FIRST LEGO League program is great because it provides that STEM opportunity in a way compatible with classical values because it goes beyond just programming and building a robot,” said Ms. Giacumakis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ronica Millerborg and Katie Happ took on the challenge of teaching three teams of six students in the robotics class. While the program is a class, the work has to be completely student driven. In order to help students take responsibility, each of the six members of each team took on a different role. Members of The Crash team, Cole Happ was particularly interested in robotics so his role was chief  builder, while Colin Parks, who was more interested in the technicalities of the game, took on the role of lawyer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the robotics aspect, the students had to build and program a robot able to complete different missions to score points. Whether it be moving an object on a board or retrieving an object, the robot had to be programmed with very specific instructions because the students couldn’t touch it until it returned to the base.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2104" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170118_095336.jpg"><img class=" td-scroll-e-image-zoom-in wp-image-2104 size-medium" src="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170118_095336-300x281.jpg" width="300" height="281" srcset="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170118_095336-300x281.jpg 300w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170118_095336-768x719.jpg 768w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170118_095336-1024x959.jpg 1024w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170118_095336-696x652.jpg 696w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170118_095336-1068x1000.jpg 1068w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170118_095336-448x420.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Robot Mission Board</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had to build a robot that could do a lot of things, but we also had to be very exact in the directions we programmed into it. We took the base design, but then added these prongs and modified the wheels and how it drives. We tested to see how the basic robot worked on the course and then we modified it to do better the missions. The programming is really important because if you mess up in the first part, it will throw the rest off and you might not complete the mission,” said Cole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students are given three tries to score as many points as possible in two and a half minutes. Their highest scoring mission is added to the robotics portion of the overall score.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research aspect of the competition challenged students to identify a problem in relations between humans and animals, and the to propose a way to solve it. The Crash chose to tackle rhino poaching.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2105" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2105 size-medium" src="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-80x60.jpg 80w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-265x198.jpg 265w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-696x522.jpg 696w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://responsiveed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Crash&#8217;s proposal on how to improve monitoring of rhino poaching.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We thought their topic might be too challenging, but because it was their choice they were interested and invested. They actually did some great research on a complicated issue and had some good solutions. They suggested improving the use of drones. A challenge is the battery life of the drones, so they suggested placing charging ports along the drones’ routes,” said Ms. Happ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each member of the team had a specific role from builder to researcher, but all of the students memorized the core values and presented different parts of their research for the judges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the students performed well on the research and and robot aspects of the competition, their real strength was the core values and character component. Throughout the event, unknown judges walked around noting the behavior of each team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the character piece was really the reason why our students won the competition. Because we are a seven habits school, we really incorporate the core values well. During the breaks a lot of the other teams were on their phones, but our students were talking together and playing cards completely of their own volition,” said Ms. Millerborg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point during the day, one team sabotaged another team. The Crash volunteered to help the struggling team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can use Bluetooth on the robots. Someone connected to this team’s robot and deleted all their programming. We heard what had happened so we went over to ask if they wanted our help and needed any parts,” said Colin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their win, The Crash was able to bypass the qualifying rounds and head straight to the North Texas regional competition. The school’s other two robotics teams did well in their own qualifying rounds, but they didn’t make it to the regional competition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the February 4th regional competition against 391 other teams, The Crash received the </span><a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/flljr/awards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gracious Professionalism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> award for their overall respect and kindness as a team.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="dropcap dropcap3">P</span>remier High School Alumnae <a href="https://responsiveed.com/blog/student-utilizes-the-premier-model-to-achieve-her-dream/" target="_blank">Calvere Robinson</a> has a busy schedule, but between her classes as a double major at <a href="https://www.arkansasbaptist.edu/" target="_blank">Arkansas South Baptist College</a> and working with disabled children, she still finds time every day to volunteer at Premier High School of Little Rock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mostly help out as needed. I’ll help coach students who are struggling. I tell them about college, and I think it helps them realize anything is possible for them,” said Calvere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving back is important to her because she is thankful for the opportunities she received at Premier. Moving from Chicago college-prep school, Calvere was looking for a challenge. When she heard the program would allow her to accelerate her academic program, Calvere chose Premier High School. With the encouragement she received at her new school, she completed her course work early and started college when she was 16.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calvere is part of a new effort launched by campus director Dennis Felton to connect alumni with the current students. Through the Premier High School Alumni Association, former students come back to volunteer and encourage current students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in a unique position because we are a small school with a family-oriented culture, and we are located on the Arkansas South Baptist College campus. I had a lot of alumni interested in volunteering and supporting the school,” said Mr. Felton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to supporting current students, alumni have found maintaining a relationship with their high school has helped them. Wade Williams, who graduated in 2016 and is attending Arkansas Southern Baptist College, still finds his high school teachers helpful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I volunteer almost every day at Premier. I like seeing my old teachers and having the community. Sometimes when I am struggling in my college classwork, they will coach me. The school is a great support group. When I need someone to talk to, they are always there,” said Wade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From cleaning tables and making copies to planning events and mentoring current students, alumni are proving to be asset to the school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a pretty tight-knit school. Our teachers really care about their students even after they graduate, and our alumni really feel a connection. Currently alumni help out in as many ways as we need around the campus, from different tasks to being an encouraging influence on our current students. As our school gets older I hope to grow the alumni association so we can help students network to find jobs after college,” said Mr. Felton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond providing students with the academic support they need to graduate, Mr. Felton believes developing relationships with each student helps them meet their potential.
