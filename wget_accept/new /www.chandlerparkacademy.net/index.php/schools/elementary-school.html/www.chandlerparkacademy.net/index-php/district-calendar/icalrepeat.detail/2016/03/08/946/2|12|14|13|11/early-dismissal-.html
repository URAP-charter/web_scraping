<h2><strong>Chandler Park Academy (CPA) School District has experienced some technical difficulties with its website and it is currently indicating outdated information about the school and scheduled events.</strong> </h2>
<p>CPA has been diligently working over the last week with the company who hosts and services our website to resolve the problem. As we&rsquo;ve been informed that the service company is experiencing internal issues on their end, CPA will request that the website be taken down as to not cause any further confusion for parents of our CPA students, staff, and site visitors.</p>
