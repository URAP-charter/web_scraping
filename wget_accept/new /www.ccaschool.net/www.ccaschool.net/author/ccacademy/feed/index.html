		</p><p>In May of 2014 a committee was formed to look closely at our safety and security at CCA. As a result of the work of this<br />
committee, a new PA system was installed and procedures for our lockdown and lockouts were improved, and outside door<br />
handles and locks were replaced. A large part of the committee’s work was to explore the possibility of our own employees<br />
carrying concealed guns with the purpose of acting as school security officers, in addition to their regular duties. Members of<br />
the committee researched the steps that other districts have taken, and we found their advice, as well as the input from our<br />
attorney and insurance company very useful.</p>
<p>Our next step was to elicit the input from our most important voices, our CCA families. We had a great turn-out at our CCA<br />
community discussion back in July, and since then we have been overwhelmed by the support of our families. THANK YOU!!</p>
<p>Some of our employees who were interested in acting as a Cardinal Security Personnel (CSP) began training in the late<br />
summer months. Each participant spent a minimum of 25 hours in classroom training and range time, and another 11 hours in<br />
an active shooter response training at CCA. In addition, all CSP passed the POST qualification, which is the same qualification<br />
that is required from our local law enforcement. Finally, at the December 3rd board meeting, the participants were approved.<br />
We are excited to finally be able to take this step to make CCA a safer place. Once all documentation is submitted to our<br />
insurance company, our CSP’s can begin carrying, which will likely occur after returning from Christmas break.</p>
