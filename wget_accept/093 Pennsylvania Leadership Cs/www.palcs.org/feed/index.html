				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently had the chance to speak to PALCS High School teacher, Mr. Michael Logue, who has been working at PALCS since 2011. Mr. Logue teaches 11th and 12th grade students Economics, Human Geography, and Street Law.</p>
<p>Mr. Logue grew up and continues to live in southeastern PA with his wife and three children. He enjoys traveling and has been to many different countries including, Panama, Dominican Republic, Canada, Germany, Austria, and Egypt. During his summer break he caddies at a local golf club. </p>
<p>Mr. Logue earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in History from West Chester University as well as his Social Studies Certification for grades 7-12. He began working at PALCS the year after he graduated from college. In high school, he was deeply influenced by his own educational leaders that he felt he had a calling to pursue that career path as well.</p>
<p>“I had a lot of teachers, mentors, and coaches who guided me through middle and high school. I had and continue to have a tremendous amount of respect for their commitment and passion to guide, mentor, and develop students,” reminisced Mr. Logue. “I believe my personality and teaching style fits well in a high school environment,” he explained.</p>
<p>Mr. Logue connects with his students through email, phone, live virtual classes, and school events. “Meeting my students in person for the first time is one of the highlights of my year. I try to attend as many PALCS events as I can, from school dances to graduation, because I look forward to meeting many of my students,” said he said. “My students know that if they need anything, they can contact me and I&#8217;ll get back to them very quickly,” he continued.</p>
<p>Mr. Logue attributes PA Leadership’s continuous growth and success to the knowledge, creativity, commitment, passion, and compassion of the PALCS faculty. “We&#8217;re a community that deeply and genuinely cares about the needs and desires of our students,” he said. When students enroll at PALCS, they have to develop time management skills and a routine that will work best for them. As Mr. Logue puts it, “you [as a PALCS student] now have the responsibility to create a schedule that works best for you and even more you have a responsibility to keep that schedule,” he explained.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Mr. Logue for taking the time to speak with us and share his story! PALCS has over 160 highly qualified, state certified teachers who are dedicated to our students’ success and well being. Here at PALCS, our students’ are our priority, with hands-on learning, individualized classes, and a flexible schedule PALCS students are given unique opportunities that one might not find in a typical brick-and-mortar school environment. We strive to help our students’ succeed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the 2016-2017 school year continues to progress, classes become more challenging, students workloads increase and some may get distracted during the winter months. That is why PALCS is so proud to announce that over 40% of our student population has earned an honor roll certificate for marking period two.</p>
<p>Taking place from November 9, 2016 to January 25, 2017, marking period two always proves to be one of the hardest. With holiday excitement and the distraction of break, students can lose focus. PALCS students have made us proud and kept their focus on succeeding in their studies, with 1,023 students receiving honors for their continued hard work and discipline. </p>
<p>At PALCS, the honor roll is separated into 3 groups: Distinguished, for students who received all A’s; Honors, for students who received all A’s and B’s; and Merit, for students who have received all A’s, B’s, and no more than one C.</p>
<p>Between elementary, middle and high school, there were a total of 402 students who earned a Distinguished Certificate, 437 students who earned an Honors Certificate and 184 students who earned a Merit Certificate.</p>
<p>The complete list of all students who have made honor roll is available to currently enrolled students and parents on the PALCSchool homepage. Certificates are being sent out this week.</p>
<p>On behalf of everyone here at PALCS, we would like to congratulate all of the students who have earned a certificate in marking period two. If you are struggling, it is not too late to turn this year around; we believe in each student’s success and are here to help you reach your goals both in academics and life!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On January 20, 2017, PALCS students, guests, and staff gathered together on both sides of the state to dance the night away at PA Leadership’s annual Snowball Dance. Two dances were held, one in the east in West Chester and one in the west in Pittsburgh. PALCS students in grades 9-12 were invited to attend along with their guests.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.palcs.org/western-regional-center/">Western Regional Center</a> in Pittsburgh welcomed 17 students and guests onsite to the office where the dance took place in the School of Professional Studies center. “We transformed our student space into a winter wonderland and hopefully set the stage for a night our students will never forget. It was fantastic,&#8221; said Student Network Coordinator Mrs. Carrie Longstreth, who is in charge of planning the dances on the west. “It&#8217;s always great to see our students start the night as strangers and end the night as friends.  Any chance we get to help them create high school memories is a win!” she continued.</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the state the Snowball Dance was held at the Meehan Center in West Chester, PA. PALCS teachers and staff welcomed 150 students and guests to the largest Snowball Dance in PALCS history. “As usual, our students were on their best behavior and danced the night away! Our students love to line dance &#8211; who knew!  I would say 98% of the kids were out on the dance floor when a line dance song was played,” explained special education teacher Mrs. Deb Kulp-Woodruff, who is on the dance committee. </p>
<p>Thanks to the idea of social studies teacher Mr. Michael Logue, the dance on the east also featured a hot chocolate bar for the students as they were leaving the dance and venturing home in the winter weather. “It was a huge hit,” said Mrs. Kulp-Woodruff.</p>
<p>We spoke with new PALCS parent Sheila and her son Ethan, who is in his first year at PALCS and participates in the Center for Performing and Fine Arts (<a href="http://www.palcs.org/cpfa/">CPFA</a>). Ethan attended the Snowball Dance in West Chester and was initially tentative. “We weren&#8217;t sure what a PALCS dance full of &#8216;strangers&#8217; would be like. Ethan simply hoped there would be opportunities to meet new people, hear good music and dance. The Snowball delivered on all these areas,” said Sheila. By attending the dance, Ethan had a chance to not only spend time with some CPFA students, but also branch out and get to know other PALCS students and teachers. “We traveled 35-40 minutes to West Chester. I truly appreciated the venue that the organizers chose because it was new, convenient and fairly easy to drop off &#038; pick up,” explained Sheila, “I think PALCS does a great job working to create a community, in spite of the challenges cyber school has in this regard,” she continued.</p>
<p>PALCS offers many opportunities for socialization and it is always so wonderful to get the chance to see PALCS students and families. Be on the lookout for upcoming events on the school calendar!  The East and West Senior Prom is being finalized as we speak and the details will be released soon. Currently enrolled students can check the PALCSchool calendar for details, and interested families can keep looking for blog posts of our activities here on palcs.org!</p>
<p>We would like to offer a huge thank you to all the staff and dance committee members who put their time and effort into making these dances such a success and an enjoyable evening for the students. We would especially like to thank Mrs. Longstreth and Mrs. Kulp-Woodruff for all their hard work on organizing these wonderful dances, as well as the students and their families for sharing the evening with us and taking advantage of the opportunities to socialize with one another. We realize that PALCS families come from all around the state and it is truly wonderful to be able to meet everyone and make genuine connections!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The PALCS high school Academic Team has just finished their regular season in the top half of all high schools in the highly competitive Chester County League.  Their season is over just yet; the team is now headed to the semi-finals in February. </p>
<p>At the recent Downingtown East Invitational National Academic Quiz Tournament (NAQT), PALCS won the consolation bracket, ending the day with an 8-2 record. The tournament was attended by nationally ranked squads from Pennsylvania, New York, and Maryland. </p>
<p>There are 13 PALCS students on the academic team, ranging in grades 9-12.  All the students on the team are also members of the University Scholars Program (USP).  The teams’ <a href="http://www.cciu.org/cms/lib4/PA01001436/Centricity/Domain/45/16.17%20Academic%20Comp%20Schedule.pdf" target="_blank">regular season</a> takes place from October to January. </p>
<p>“We’re having a rebuilding year, last year we were nationally ranked,” said the academic team’s coach and USP math teacher Bert Sommar.  “At our recent tournament, our top individual tied for the 5th highest individual score, which is pretty impressive,” he continued.</p>
<p>Additionally, PALCS student Alex Gustafson tied for 5th in individual standings. The full standings are available on the <a href="https://www.naqt.com/stats/tournament-individuals.jsp?tournament_id=7936&#038;playoffs=true" target="_blank">NAQT website</a>.</p>
<p>The semi-finals for the Varsity and Junior Varsity teams will take place at the Chester County Intermediate Unit building located in Downingtown, PA. Varsity is scheduled to take place February 6, 2017 and Junior Varsity is scheduled for February 13, 2017, both from 9 am &#8211; 4 pm.  Teams that advance from the semi-finals will then report to the Championship round which will take place at TCHS Brandywine on March 28, 2017 from 7 pm &#8211; 9 pm.  The victors from the championship round will then be invited to the Pennsylvania State Academic Competition in Harrisburg, which is tentatively scheduled for April 28, 2017.</p>
<p>On behalf of all of us here at PALCS, we would like to congratulate and wish good luck to all the members of the PALCS Academic Team in these next competitions! We are proud to have you represent our school and community!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>January 22nd through January 28th marks the 7th annual National School Choice Week (NSCW). This important week includes thousands of events across the country that highlight the demand for successful education options for students around the nation.</p>
<p>NSCW is held every January and has one important goal, according to <a href="http://schoolchoiceweek.com" target="_blank">schoolchoiceweek.com</a>: “to raise public awareness of all types of education options for children. These options include traditional public schools, public charter schools, magnet schools, online learning, private schools, and homeschooling.”</p>
<p>In order to meet this goal, the NSCW organization urges everyone nationwide, from schools to individuals, to hold supportive events commemorating school choice options. This week also allows organizations, schools and individuals the chance to demonstrate the need for more choices and better opportunities for children. </p>
<p>NSCW began in 2011 and has tremendously grown into the largest celebration of opportunity in education.  For the past 5 years, NSCW has choreographed dance routines to go along with the official song chosen for each year’s festivities. They then upload a <a href="https://schoolchoiceweek.com/dance" target="_blank">tutorial</a> on their website featuring the dance to the chosen song and encourage students, schools, and organizations to learn the dance moves and upload their own videos to YouTube using #schoolchoice in support of school choice week. </p>
<p>This year’s song is “Can’t Stop the Feeling by Justin Timberlake. 50 PALCS Center for Performing and Fine Arts (CPFA) students showed their support for NSCW by learning the dance and uploading their own video for the world to see that their school is one of choice, not chance. They can be seen enthusiastically dancing with their yellow NSCW scarves at the CPFA building in West Chester, PA.  </p>
