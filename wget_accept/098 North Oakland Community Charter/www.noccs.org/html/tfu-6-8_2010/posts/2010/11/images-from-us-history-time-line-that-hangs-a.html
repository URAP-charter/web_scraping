<div class='post_body'><p>These are snapshots from the class US History timeline that hangs from corner to corner in our classroom. Students watched a documentary of US History and created a list of the people, events, wars and struggles that were presented in the film. From those notes they chose one topic to represent on the timeline. The timeline is a living document that will evolve throughout the year. The next step is for students to choose one struggle from US History to research and collaborate in a small group to create a presentation of that struggle. For example, students might choose slavery, Japanese internment camps, Native American genocide, woman's suffrage, the Revolutionary War. This is where students go into more depth and build collaboration skills.</p>
