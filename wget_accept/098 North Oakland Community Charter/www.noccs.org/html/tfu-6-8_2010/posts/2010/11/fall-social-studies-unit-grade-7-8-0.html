<p> </p><p style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial;">In this unit students study and explore the Human Rights. Students learn key vocabulary terms used in the Document of Human Rights (DOHR), view digital media promoting the DOHR, study some of the key articles in the DOHR and learn about current and historical violations of Human Rights. As final products, students create a poster that defines Human Rights, identifies 5 specific Human Rights, 3 examples of violations of Human Rights and discusses why we as citizens should care about our rights and the rights of others.<span style="">  </span></span></p> <p style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p> <p style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial;">Students also learn about Human Rights within the context of American History. Students study history of the United States through written text, video/documentary and primary source documents. Stemming from that study, students choose to focus on the struggle of one group in the United States during the period of pre-colonization through the industrial age. As a culminating activity, students will draw conclusions about how the new nation was shaped by each of these struggles. <br /></span></p><p style=""><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial;"></span></p><p style=""> <span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial;">Stay tuned for documentation of student learning (students in action, student work, etc.) - making learning visible.<br /></span></p></div>
