<div class='post_body'>In week three of the unit on China/India, the students began doing weekly arts-integrated lessons to help them envision what they were learning and incorporate authentic studio art practice. The first lesson focused on the tradition of threshold art (rangoli) in ancient to modern day India, and the significance that such art has in terms of Indian cultural values. After a slideshow and discussion, the students began making their own rangoli designs on a template taken from the Asian Art Museum materials. Photos of their work in progress are included here, as well as documentation of the growing learning wall outside the classroom, which features the different ways students have visualized their learning throughout the unit. This wall is a living document which shows their growth, and gives them the daily opportunity to locate themselves within the arc of their learning process.<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
