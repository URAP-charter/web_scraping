<strong>Gold rush 1 (ships).3gp</strong>

<p>The following video shows a snippet of the kind of conversations which arise in class as the students grapple with new concepts and ways of understanding/processing those concepts. You will notice that the dialogue is very questions-based, as both student and teacher (Nate is presenting, in this case) discuss ways of interpreting what (and how!) we know. The question raised by the student (Eli) was stimulated by a side show discussion of historical images of San Francisco bay, which shows how generative it can be to analyze many types of information (visual image, audio, written, etc).</p></div>
