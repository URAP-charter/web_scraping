<div class='post_body'>Comics lessons 2& 3 <br />1) Nate first talked to the students about the importance of considering the flow of a story (what are you going to show? What's the best way to do this? How can you get the viewer more interested in what they are seeing?). Nate demonstrated a small story line in 4 frames and invited the students to suggest different outcomes for the events, as well as creative way to frame the action visually. What is the environment? How are you going to show different kinds of text/speech/thought? What is the perspective of the viewer? Of the characters? Lots of questions help to push the students to really think about what they are seeing, and develops their sense of ownership over the process. <p /> 2) The second lesson focused on character development, facial and body language and expression in particular. The class brainstormed what kind of expressions accompanied certain emotions, and Nate taught them how to create an 'expression sheet,' where an artist would explore the different facial expressions of their character (a kind of get-to-know-you exercise for their creations!). This lesson couples technical artistic skills with thinking and learning around what emotions look like and what it means to develop a character. <br />Check out these faces: <p /> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
