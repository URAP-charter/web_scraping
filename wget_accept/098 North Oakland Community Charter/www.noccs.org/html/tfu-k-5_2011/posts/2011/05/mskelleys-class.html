<div class='post_body'><p>This week in the Waterworks unit the 2/3 classes have been learning about the water cycle; how water moves and changes forms. Below you will see sample photos from the learning wall in the classroom, where students brainstormed how much they knew about water before the unit even began - honoring their prior knowledge and using it as the base on which to construct new learning. The last photo is from an activity called pollution soup, where students talked about all the muck that can end up in our lakes, streams, ocean, and eventually contaminate the water that we need to live. The students then recreated a "soup" of these pollutants in a large quart jar in the room; you can see Samira staring it down!</p>
