                                    and overbearing.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>1</span></span></sup> This is the Angry Black Woman (ABW) popularized in the cinema and on television.
                                    She is tart-tongued and emasculating, one hand on a hip and the other pointing and
                                    jabbing (or arms akimbo), violently and rhythmically rocking her head, mocking African
                                    American men for offenses ranging from being unemployed to sexually pursuing white
                                    women. She is a shrill nagger with irrational states of anger and indignation and
                                    is often mean-spirited and abusive. Although African American men are her primary
                                    targets, she has venom for anyone who insults or disrespects her. The Sapphire's desire
                                    to dominate and her hyper-sensitivity to injustices make her a perpetual complainer,
                                    but she does not criticize to improve things; rather, she criticizes because she is
                                    unendingly bitter and wishes that unhappiness on others. The Sapphire Caricature is
                                    a harsh portrayal of African American women, but it is more than that; it is a social
                                    control mechanism that is employed to punish black women who violate the societal
                                    norms that encourage them to be passive, servile, non-threatening, and unseen.<br /><br /></p>

                                      height="199" /> From the 1800s through the mid-1900s, black women were often portrayed in popular
                                 culture as "Sassy Mammies" who ran their own homes with iron fists, including berating
                                 black husbands and children. These women were allowed, at least symbolically, to defy
                                 some racial norms. During the Jim Crow period, when real blacks were often beaten,
                                 jailed, or killed for arguing with whites, fictional Mammies were allowed to pretend-chastise
                                 whites, including men. Their sassiness was supposed to indicate that they were accepted
                                 as members of the white family, and acceptance of that sassiness implied that slavery
                                 and segregation were not overly oppressive. A well-known example of a Sassy Mammy
                                 was Hattie McDaniel, a black actress who played feisty, quick-tempered mammies in
                                 many movies, including <em>Judge Priest</em> (Wurtzel &amp; Ford, 1934), <em>Music is Magic</em> (Stone &amp; Marshall, 1935), <em>The Little Colonel</em> (DeSylva &amp; Butler, 1935), <em>Alice Adams</em> (Berman &amp; Stevens, 1935), <em>Saratoga</em> (Hyman &amp; Conway, 1937), <em>The Mad Miss Manton</em> (Wolfson &amp; Jason, 1938), and <em>Gone With the Wind</em> (Selznick &amp; Fleming, 1939). In these roles she was sassy (borderline impertinent)
                                 but always loyal. She was not a threat to the existing social order.<br /><br /> It was not until the <em>Amos 'n' Andy</em> radio show that the characterization of African American women as domineering, aggressive,
                                 and emasculating shrews became popularly associated with the name Sapphire. The show
                                 was conceived by Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, two white actors who portrayed
                                 the characters Amos Jones and Andy Brown by mimicking and mocking black behavior and
                                 dialect. At its best, <em>Amos 'n' Andy</em> was a situational comedy; at its worse, it was an auditory minstrel show.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>2</span></span></sup> The show, with a mostly-white cast, aired on the radio from 1928 to 1960, with intermittent
                                 interruptions. The television version of the show, with network television's first
                                 all-black cast, aired on CBS from 1951-53, with syndicated reruns from 1954 to 1966.
                                 It was removed, in large part, through the efforts of the National Association for
                                 the Advancement of Colored People and the civil rights movement. Both as a radio show3
                                 and television show, <em>Amos 'n' Andy</em> was extremely popular, and this was unfortunate for African Americans because it
                                 popularized racial caricatures of blacks. Americans learned that blacks were comical,
                                 not as actors but as a race.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="float: left; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;"

                                 Sea, a black fraternal lodge. The lead characters were Amos Jones, a Harlem taxi driver
                                 and his gullible friend, Andy Brown. Starring in a nontitle lead role was the character
                                 George "Kingfish" Stevens, the leader of the lodge. Many of the stories revolved around
                                 Kingfish, a get-rich-quick schemer and a con artist who avoided work, and, when possible,
                                 took financial advantage of the ignorance and naivete of Andy and others (see, for
                                 example, this clip from the episode <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQOtTHmwgm8" target="_blank">Kingfish Sells a Lot</a>). Kingfish was the prototypical Coon, a lazy, easily confused, chronically unemployed,
                                 financially inept buffoon given to malapropisms. Kingfish was married to Sapphire
                                 Stevens who regularly berated him as a failure.<br /><br /> Kingfish represented the worst in racial stereotyping; there was little redemptive
                                 about the character. His ignorance was highlighted by his nonsensical misuse of words,
                                 for example, ""I deny the allegation, Your Honor, and I resents the alligator," or
                                 "I'se regusted." Kingfish was not a good thinker or speaker. Even worse, he was a
                                 crook without scruples. He was too lazy to work and not above exploiting his wife
                                 and friends.<br /><br /> In other words, he was a television embodiment of some of the unforgiving ideas that
                                 many Americans had about black men. Other characters, including Lightnin,' a Stepin
                                 Fetchit-like character on the show, had jobs and were honest, but Kingfish's worthlessness
                                 justified Sapphire's harsh critique of his life. It must be noted, that Sapphire Stevens
                                 directed her disgust at her husband; hers was not the generalized anger that is today
                                 associated with angry black women.<br /><br />

                                 Sue Jewell (1993), a sociologist, opined that the Sapphire image necessitates the
                                 presence of an African American man; "It is the African American male that represents
                                 the point of contention, in an ongoing verbal dual between Sapphire and the African
                                 American male ... (His) lack of integrity and use of cunning and trickery provides
                                 her with an opportunity to emasculate him through her use of verbal put downs" (p.
                                 45). In the all-black or mostly-black situational comedies that have appeared on television
                                 from the 1970s to the present, the Sapphire is a stock character. Like Sapphire Stevens,
                                 she demeans and belittles lazy, ignorant, or otherwise flawed black male characters.<br /><br /> Blacks on television have been overrepresented in situational comedies and underrepresented
                                 in dramatic series; one problem with this imbalance is that blacks in situational
                                 comedies are portrayed in racially stereotypical ways in order to get laughs. Canned
                                 laughter prompts the television audience to laugh as the angry black woman, the Sapphire,
                                 insults and mocks black males.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="float: right; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;"

                                      height="240" /> Aunt Esther (also called Aunt Anderson) was a Sapphire character on the television
                                 situational comedy <em>Sanford and Son</em>, which premiered on NBC in 1972, with a final episode in 1977, and is still running
                                 in syndication. She was the Bible-swinging, angry nemesis and sister-in-law of the
                                 main character, Fred. Theirs was a love-mostly hate relationship. Fred would call
                                 Aunt Esther ugly and she would call him a "fish-eyed fool," an "old sucka," or a "beady-eyed
                                 heathen." Then, they would threaten to hit each other. Aunt Esther dominated her husband
                                 Woodrow, a mild-mannered alcoholic. In this latter relationship, you have the idea
                                 of the aggressive black woman dominating a weak, morally defective black man.<br /><br /> The situational comedy <em>Good Times</em> aired between 1974 and 1979 on the CBS television network. The show followed the
                                 life of the Evans family in a Chicago housing project modeled on the infamous Cabrini-Green
                                 projects. This was one of the first times that a poor family had been highlighted
                                 in a weekly television series. Episodes of <em>Good Times</em> dealt with the Evans' attempts to survive despite living in suffocating poverty.
                                 There were several racial caricatures on the show, most notably the son, James Evans
                                 Jr. (also called J.J.), who devolved into a Coon-like minstrel. After the first season
                                 the episodes increasingly focused on J.J.'s stereotypically buffoonish behavior. Esther
                                 Rolle, the actress who played the role of Florida Evans, the mother, expressed her
                                 dislike for J.J.'s character in a 1975 interview with <em>Ebony</em> magazine:<span style="font-family: Courier New;"> "He's eighteen and he doesn't work. He can't read or write. He doesn't think. The
                                    show didn't start out to be that...Little by little-with the help of the artist, I
                                    suppose, because they couldn't do that to me -- they have made J.J. more stupid and
                                    enlarged the role. Negative images have been slipped in on us through the character
                                    of the oldest child."("Bad Times" 1975)</span>In black-themed situational comedies when there is a Coon character there is often
                                 a Sapphire character to mock him. In Good Times a character that bantered with and
                                 mocked J.J. was his sister, Thelma. A clearer example of a Sapphire, however, was
                                 the neighbor, Willona Woods, though she rarely targeted J.J. Instead, Willona belittled
                                 Nathan Bookman, the overweight superintendent, and she put down a series of worthless
                                 boyfriends, an ex-husband, politicians, and other men with questionable morals and
                                 work ethics.<br /><br /> In situational comedies with a primarily black cast, the black male does not have
                                 to be lazy, thick-witted, or financially unsuccessful for him to be taunted by a Sapphire
                                 character. <em>The Jeffersons</em>, which aired from 1975 to 1985, focused on an upper-middle class family that had
                                 climbed up from the working class -- in the show's theme song there is the line, "We
                                 finally got a piece of the pie." George and Louise Jefferson were making so much money
                                 from their dry-cleaning businesses that they hired a housekeeper, Florence Johnston.
                                 Her relationship with George was often antagonistic and the back-talking, wisecracking,
                                 housekeeper approximated a Sapphire. She often teased George about his short stature,
                                 balding head, and decisions.<br /><br /> Another example of a Sapphire was the character Pamela (Pam) James, who appeared
                                 on <em>Martin</em>, a situational comedy that aired from 1992 to 1997 on Fox. Pam was a badmouthed,
                                 wisecracking friend/foe of the lead character, Martin. Tichina Arnold, the actress
                                 who played Pam, plays Rochelle, a dominating, aggressive matriarch in the situational
                                 comedy, <em>Everybody Hates Chris</em>, which ran from 2005 to 2009, and is still aired on cable television. Arnold has
                                 mastered the role of the angry, black woman.<br /><br />

                                 one set of racial caricatures -- Mammy, Tom, Uncle, Picanninny -- for a new set of
                                 equally offensive racial caricatures -- Bucks (sex-crazed deviants) Brutes, (pimps,
                                 hit-men, and dope peddlers), and Nats (Whites-haters). One old caricature, the Jezebel,
                                 was revamped. The portrayal of African American women as hyper-sexual temptresses
                                 was as old as American slavery, but during the blaxploitation period the Jezebel caricature
                                 and the Sapphire caricature merged into a hybrid: angry "whores" fighting injustice.
                                 Black actresses such as Pam Grier built careers starring in blaxploitation movies.
                                 Their characters resembled those of the black male superheroes: they were physically
                                 attractive and aggressive rebels, willing and able to use their bodies, brains, and
                                 guns to gain revenge against corrupt officials, drug dealers, and violent criminals.
                                 Their anger was not focused solely, or primarily, at black men; rather, it was focused
                                 at injustice and the perpetuators of injustice.<br /><br /> In the film <em>Coffy</em> (Papazian &amp; Hill, 1973), Pam Grier (Coffy) plays a nurse by day and vigilante by
                                 night who conducts a brutal one-woman war on organized crime. In the movie, she pretends
                                 to be a "strung out whore" to get revenge on the drug dealers who got her little sister
                                 hooked on heroin. Coffy lures the culprits back to their room where she graphically
                                 shoots one in the head and gives the other a fatal dose of heroin. The remainder of
                                 the movie finds Coffy using guns and her body to punish King George, a flamboyant
                                 pimp, the sadistic mobster Arturo Vitroni, and every Mafioso and crooked cop who crosses
                                 her path.<br /><br />

                                 Today, the Sapphire is one of the dominant portrayals of black woman. This is evident
                                 by the words of Cal Thomas, a commentator for FOX Television:<span style="font-family: Courier New;"> "Look at the image of angry black women on television. Politically you have Maxine
                                    Waters of California, liberal Democrat. She's always angry every time she gets on
                                    television. Cynthia McKinney, another angry black woman. And who are the black women
                                    you see on the local news at night in cities all over the country. They're usually
                                    angry about something. They've had a son who has been shot in a drive-by shooting.
                                    They are angry at Bush. So you don't really have a profile of non-angry black women,
                                    of whom there are quite a few."("Transcript: Fox", 2008)</span>Thomas, admittedly an untrained sociologist, expressed what many Americans see and
                                 internalize, namely, images of Sapphires: angry at black men, white men, white women,
                                 the federal government, racism, maybe life itself. Thomas, shortly after making his
                                 statements about black women, agreed with a co-panelist that Oprah Winfrey is not
                                 angry.<br /><br /> The portrayal of black women as angry Sapphires permeates this culture. A Google
                                 search of <em>Angry Black Women</em> or <em>ABW</em> will demonstrate how pervasive this caricature has become. She lives in most movies
                                 with an all-black or predominantly black cast. For example, there is Terri, cussing
                                 and insulting the "manhood" of black men in <em>Barbershop</em> (Brown, Teitel, Tillman &amp; Story, 2002) and its sequel, <em>Barbershop 2</em> (Gartner, Teitel, Tillman &amp; Sullivan, 2004). There is the augmentative Angela in
                                 <em>Why Did I Get Married</em> (Cannon &amp; Perry, 2007). There is clip art of an angry black woman at <a href="http://www.clipartof.com/details/clipart/16467.html" target="_blank">www.clipartof.com/details/clipart/16467.html</a>. The clip art description reads, "Royalty-free people clipart picture image of an

There
                                 is even a pseudo-malady called, "Angry Black Woman Syndrome."<br /><br /> The tabloid talk shows that became popular in the 1990s: <em>The Jerry Springer Show, The Jenny Jones Show, The Maury Povich Show</em>, and <em>The Ricki Lake Show</em>, helped reinforce the racial stereotypes of African Americans, including the stereotype
                                 of black women as angry, castrating shrews. By the early 2000s, the "Trash Talk" shows
                                 had receded in popularity, in part because of the emergence of so-called "Reality
                                 Shows." Again, these shows served as vehicles for African American women to be portrayed
                                 as Sapphires. Vanessa E. Jones, from the <em>Boston Globe</em>, wrote of the Sapphire:<span style="font-family: Courier New;">"You see elements of her in Alicia Calaway of "Survivor: All-Stars," who indulged
                                    in a temperamental bout of finger wagging during an argument in 2001's "Survivor:
                                    The Australian Outback." Coral Smith, who rules with an iron tongue on MTV's "Real
                                    World/Road Rules Challenge: The Inferno," browbeat one female cast mate so badly a
                                    week ago that she challenged Smith to a fight. Then there's Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth
                                    of "The Apprentice," who rode the angry-black-woman stereotype to the covers of <em>People</em> and <em>TV Guide</em> magazines even as she made fellow African-American businesswomen wince."(Jones, 2004)</span>Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth gained a great deal of national disdain and celebrity
                                 as a contestant on <em>The Apprentice</em>, Donald Trump's reality show. Manigault-Stallworth, who is almost always referred
                                 to by the single name Omarosa, was portrayed (and intentionally acted) as a cross
                                 between a Jezebel -- a hypersexual flirt and seductress -- and a bitter, aggressive
                                 Sapphire. Lorien Olive (2008), a political blogger, theorized on how white people
                                 saw Omarosa:<span style="font-family: Courier New;">"At least among white people, she was interpreted in various ways as conniving, lazy,
                                    selfish, a sham, overly-ambitious, uppity, ungrateful, and paranoid. I guess I was
                                    always less interested in whether Omarosa <em>was</em> actually any of those things or whether it was simply an effect of the distortion
                                    of the editing of reality television. I was more interested in the fact that Omarosa
                                    seemed to stand for something bigger in the eyes of many white people. Her constant
                                    accusations of racism directed toward her fellow contestants and the fact that she
                                    wore her alienation and distrust of her team-mates on her sleeve opened up a whole
                                    world of racial speculation and ridicule. I would say debate, but in all of my internet
                                    travels, I haven't found much of anyone who wanted to go out on a limb for Omarosa.
                                    The fact that so many white people felt justified in their hatred for Omarosa (a hatred
                                    that could be passed of as a benign over-investment in a guilty pleasure: a reality
                                    TV series) is telling. She became the symbol of everything that went wrong in the
                                    post-Civil Rights Era: paranoid "reverse racism"; the ungrateful and undeserving product
                                    of affirmative action; the "uppity" Black person who puts on airs; the beautiful,
                                    hyper-sexualized Black woman who pulled the wool over the powerful white man's eyes."</span>Olive next makes a connection that many others are making on Internet sites, namely,
                                 that First Lady Michelle Obama is the new Omarosa: a bitter, selfish, uppity, ungrateful,
                                 overly-ambitious Sapphire. One of the derisive nicknames for Michelle Obama is "Omarosa
                                 Obama." This demonstrates how the Sapphire caricature has <em>broadened</em> from an emasculating hater of black men to a bitter woman who hates anyone who displeases
                                 her.<br /><br />

                                 members, but criticize a minority group for demonstrating that behavior. To use sociological
                                 jargon, this is an example of an in-group virtue becoming an out-group vice. According
                                 to the blogger abagond (2008), "Where white women are said to be 'independent,' black
                                 women are said to be 'emasculating,' robbing their men of their sense of manhood.
                                 Where white women are said to be standing up for themselves, black women are seen
                                 as wanting a fight. And so on. The same actions are read differently." Being an articulate
                                 foe of injustice may be seen as a praise-worthy trait among whites; however, black
                                 women with similar traits may be seen as bitter, selfish complainers.<br /><br /> Michelle Obama challenges the scripts that many Americans have for African American
                                 women. She is the antithesis of the Mammy caricature. The traditional portrayal of
                                 Mammy looked something like this: an obedient, loyal domestic servant, who cared more
                                 for the family members of her employer than she did for her own family; overweight
                                 and desexualized; and, most important to the portrait: not a threat to the social
                                 order. Michelle Obama is a Harvard-trained attorney, a conscientious mother, physically
                                 attractive, and she critiques and challenges the culture. She also does not fit the
                                 Jezebel image or its modern variant: the butt-shaking <em>Hoogie Mama</em> -- though FOX News tried to imply this when they referred to her in text as Senator
                                 Obama's "Baby Mama." Michelle Obama is not a Tragic Mulatto; she is a dark-skinned
                                 woman actively involved in civil rights and community activism. The so-called Tragic
                                 Mulatto was ashamed of her African heritage; Michelle Obama embraces her African American
                                 heritage and expresses her dissatisfaction with racial injustice.<br /><br /> So, if she does not fit one of the three dominant historical caricatures of African
                                 American women, what imagery is left? Ideally, she would be judged on her individual
                                 traits and not as a one-dimensional stereotype; however, there is little ideal about
                                 patterns of race relations in this country. Racial stereotyping, too often, is a convenient
                                 way to pigeonhole others into categories that make sense to us. Instead of allowing
                                 Michelle Obama to be central to a new cultural narrative of black women (and the black
                                 family) there is a growing tendency to view Michelle Obama's words and behaviors as
                                 examples of the black woman as Sapphire. When she said, while speaking at a Milwaukee,
                                 Wisconsin political rally, "for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country
                                 because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback," she was accused of being
                                 an unpatriotic, ungrateful, and angry radical. In this portrait, she is more Pam Grier
                                 (sans the gun and the hypersexuality) than Sapphire Stevens; her supposed bitterness
                                 and hatred are directed toward her country -- and implicitly its white citizens --
                                 and not toward black men. Finally, there was a label to stick to her. According to
                                 Erin Aubry Kaplan (2008), a journalist and blogger:<span style="font-family: Courier New;"> "It's worth noting how Michelle was admired as long as she filled the prescription
                                    of a successful black woman on paper -- college grad, married to an equally successful
                                    black man, a working but attentive mother, financially secure, immaculately turned
                                    out. But as soon as she began revealing herself as a person and airing her views a
                                    bit, she began shape-shifting in the public eye into another kind of black woman altogether:
                                    angry, obstinate, mouthy -- a stereotypical harpy lurking in all black women that
                                    a friend of mine calls 'Serpentina.' The consternation about Michelle suggested an
                                    old racist sentiment that you can take the girl out of the ghetto, but you can never
                                    take the ghetto out of the girl."</span>Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham and other conservative
                                 talkshow hosts rushed to paint her as the ultimate angry black woman, and they wondered
                                 aloud what she had to be angry about. Not all the lambasting came from white Americans.
                                 Mychal Massie (2008), chairman of the National Leadership Network of Black Conservatives-Project
                                 21 -- a conservative black think tank, said:<span style="font-family: Courier New;"> "I find it reprehensible that those like herself and her husband, being devoid of
                                    credible positions, are able only to blame America and castigate its citizens. And
                                    that is exactly what Michelle Obama did -- with one sentence, she attacked every American,
                                    regardless of party affiliation when she uttered those profane words...Many Americans
                                    contribute to the Obamas' extravagant lifestyle. From those who clean their floors
                                    to those who sweep their sidewalks. Her comments reveal ingratitude and were an insult
                                    to millions of hardworking Americans and legal immigrants who appreciate the freedom
                                    and opportunity America offers. This country has made it possible for Michelle Obama
                                    to enjoy every privilege she and her family enjoy. Compared to the eloquent grace
                                    of Jackie Kennedy, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and yes, even Rosalind Carter, she portrays
                                    herself as just another angry black harridan who spits in the face of the nation that
                                    made her rich, famous and prestigious."</span>Central to these "critiques" of Michelle Obama is the couched argument that a person
                                 who is a successful attorney and administrator living in a nice home has forfeited
                                 the right to talk about injustice and inequality. This argument is short-sighted and
                                 flawed. It implies that only poor people have the right to express concerns about
                                 poverty, only the sick and diseased have a right to complain about inadequate health
                                 care, only a victim of crime has the right to complain about high crime rates, and
                                 so forth. The day that the privileged in this country -- and that includes Sean Hannity,
                                 Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham, Mychal Massie, and Michelle Obama --
                                 are as disgusted with injustice and equality as is the poor black or brown or white
                                 single mother in Detroit, Michigan, is the day this country takes a living step toward
                                 realizing its potential as the "city on the top of the hill." Critiquing America is
                                 not the same as hating America.<br /><br /> How does her saying, "for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country
                                 because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback," validate Massie's claim
                                 that Michelle Obama is "another black harridan?" A <em>harridan</em> is a "scolding (even vicious) old woman" ("Harridan", n.d.). Calling someone a harridan
                                 for expressing an opinion is an ad hominem argument that tries to dismiss the substance
                                 of their opinion. Members of society who express unpopular opinions are often dismissed
                                 with personal attacks.<br /><br />

                                 Newt Gingrich and the Republican Party rode the anger of white men into political
                                 dominance in 1994. What were they angry about? Affirmative action? Multiculturalism?
                                 Liberalism? Few people, especially members of the dominant group, questioned whether
                                 white men had the <em>right</em> to be angry. After Senator Hillary Clinton lost her bid for the 2008 Democratic Presidential
                                 nomination, a great deal of media attention was given to <em>Angry White Women</em>, so angry they threatened to vote for the Republican candidate. Some of their anger
                                 was fueled by disappointment; that happens in every political campaign. Others were
                                 angry because Senator Clinton's campaign symbolized, for them, the struggles and promise
                                 of being women in this culture. Some were angry about the sexist slurs, both thinly-veiled
                                 and obvious and gross, that were directed against Senator Clinton. These angry white
                                 women had many reasons to be angry, but the point here is that their right to be angry
                                 was rarely questioned. However, when a strong-minded, high profile black woman expresses
                                 even a hint of displeasure at injustice in this culture she is treated like a non-patriotic,
                                 ungrateful Sapphire. The black woman who expresses anything short of a patriotism
                                 that borders on chauvinism is condemned.<br /><br /> With people of color, in this case black women, there is a tendency for labels to
                                 become enduring stereotypes. The Sapphire portrayal has been around for as long as
                                 black women have dared to critique their lives and treatment. Sojourner Truth was
                                 seen and treated as a Sapphire, as were Ida Bell Wells-Barnett, Fannie Lou Hamer,
                                 Ella Josephine Baker, Shirley Chisholm, Anita Hill, Alice Walker, Rita Dove, and bell
                                 hooks. But the Sapphire label has not been restricted to abolitionists, anti-lynching
                                 crusaders, civil rights activists, politicians, and black feminists/womanists. Black
                                 women executives who voice disapproval at company policies run the risk of being seen
                                 as Sapphires, especially when the policies involve race and race relations. Young
                                 African American women who show displeasure at being treated as potential thieves
                                 when they shop are treated as Sapphires. The black woman who expresses bitterness
                                 or rage about her mistreatment in intimate relationships is often seen as a Sapphire;
                                 indeed, black women who express any dissatisfaction and displeasure, especially if
                                 they express the discontentment with passion, are seen and treated as Sapphires. The
                                 Sapphire name is slur, insult, and a label designed to silence dissent and critique.
