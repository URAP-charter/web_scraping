                                      height="238" /> Lydia Maria Child introduced the literary character that we call the tragic mulatto<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>1</span></span></sup> in two short stories: "The Quadroons" (1842) and "Slavery's Pleasant Homes" (1843).
                                 She portrayed this light skinned woman as the offspring of a white slaveholder and
                                 his black female slave. This mulatto's life was indeed tragic. She was ignorant of
                                 both her mother's race and her own. She believed herself to be white and free. Her
                                 heart was pure, her manners impeccable, her language polished, and her face beautiful.
                                 Her father died; her "negro blood" discovered, she was remanded to slavery, deserted
                                 by her white lover, and died a victim of slavery and white male violence. A similar
                                 portrayal of the near-white mulatto appeared in <em>Clotel</em> (1853), a novel written by black abolitionist William Wells Brown.
                                 
                                 <p><img class="imgl" style="float: right; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;"
                                         src="http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/mulatto/untamed.jpg"
                                         alt="My Baby is Black movie poster"
                                         width="134"
                                         height="211" /> A century later literary and cinematic portrayals of the tragic mulatto emphasized
                                    her personal pathologies: self-hatred, depression, alcoholism, sexual perversion,
                                    and suicide attempts being the most common. If light enough to "pass" as white, she
                                    did, but passing led to deeper self-loathing. She pitied or despised blacks and the
                                    "blackness" in herself; she hated or feared whites yet desperately sought their approval.
                                    In a race-based society, the tragic mulatto found peace only in death. She evoked
                                    pity or scorn, not sympathy. Sterling Brown summarized the treatment of the tragic
                                    mulatto by white writers:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> White writers insist upon the mulatto's unhappiness for other reasons. To them he
                                    is the anguished victim of divided inheritance. Mathematically they work it out that
                                    his intellectual strivings and self-control come from his white blood, and his emotional
                                    urgings, indolence and potential savagery come from his Negro blood. Their favorite
                                    character, the octoroon, wretched because of the "single drop of midnight in her veins,"
                                    desires a white lover above all else, and must therefore go down to a tragic end.(Brown,
                                    1969, p. 145)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>Vara Caspary's novel <em>The White Girl</em> (1929) told the story of Solaria, a beautiful mulatto who passes for white. Her secret
                                    is revealed by the appearance of her brown-skinned brother. Depressed, and believing
                                    that her skin is becoming darker, Solaria drinks poison. A more realistic but equally
                                    depressing mulatto character is found in Geoffrey Barnes' novel <em>Dark Lustre</em> (1932). Alpine, the light-skinned "heroine," dies in childbirth, but her white baby
                                    lives to continue "a cycle of pain." Both Solaria and Alpine are repulsed by blacks,

                                 <p>Most tragic mulattoes were women, although the self-loathing Sergeant Waters in <em>A Soldier's Story</em> (Jewison, 1984) clearly fits the tragic mulatto stereotype. The troubled mulatto
                                    is portrayed as a selfish woman who will give up all, including her black family,
                                    in order to live as a white person. These words are illustrative:

                                 <p>These words were spoken by Peola, a tortured, self-hating black girl in the movie
                                    <em>Imitation of Life</em> (Laemmle &amp; Stahl, 1934). Peola, played adeptly by Fredi Washington, had skin that
                                    looked white. But she was not socially white. She was a mulatto. Peola was tired of
                                    being treated as a second-class citizen; tired, that is, of being treated like a 1930s
                                    black American. She passed for white and begged her mother to understand.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p><em>Imitation of Life</em>, based on Fannie Hurst's best selling novel, traces the lives of two widows, one
                                    white and the employer, the other black and the servant. Each woman has one daughter.
                                    The white woman, Beatrice Pullman (played by Claudette Colbert), hires the black woman,
                                    Delilah, (played by Louise Beavers) as a live-in cook and housekeeper. It is the depression,
                                    and the two women and their daughters live in poverty -- even a financially struggling
                                    white woman can afford a mammy. Their economic salvation comes when Delilah shares
                                    a secret pancake recipe with her boss. Beatrice opens a restaurant, markets the recipe,
                                    and soon becomes wealthy. She offers Delilah, the restaurant's cook, a twenty percent
                                    share of the profits. Regarding the recipe, Delilah, a true cinematic mammy, delivers
                                    two of the most pathetic lines ever from a black character: "I gives it to you, honey.
                                    I makes you a present of it." While Delilah is keeping her mistress's family intact,
                                    her relationship with Peola, her daughter, disintegrates.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Peola is the antithesis of the mammy caricature. Delilah knows her place in the Jim
                                    Crow hierarchy: the bottom rung. Hers is an accommodating resignation, bordering on
                                    contentment. Peola hates her life, wants more, wants to live as a white person, to
                                    have the opportunities that whites enjoy. Delilah hopes that her daughter will accept
                                    her racial heritage. "He [God] made you black, honey. Don't be telling Him his business.
                                    Accept it, honey." Peola wants to be loved by a white man, to marry a white man. She
                                    is beautiful, sensual, a potential wife to any white man who does not know her secret.
                                    Peola wants to live without the stigma of being black -- and in the 1930s that stigma
                                    was real and measurable. Ultimately and inevitably, Peola rejects her mother, runs
                                    away, and passes for white. Delilah dies of a broken heart. A repentant and tearful
                                    Peola returns to her mother's funeral.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Audiences, black and white (and they were separate), hated what Peola did to her mother
                                    -- and they hated Peola. She is often portrayed as the epitome of selfishness. In
                                    many academic discussions about tragic mulattoes the name Peola is included. From
                                    the mid-1930s through the late 1970s, Peola was an epithet used by blacks against
                                    light-skinned black women who identified with mainstream white society. A Peola looked
                                    white and wanted to be white. During the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Power
                                    Movement, the name Peola was an insult comparable to Uncle Tom, albeit a light-skinned
                                    female version.

                                    white. Rumor has it that in later movies makeup was used to "blacken" her skin so
                                    white audiences would know her race. She had sharply defined features; long, dark,
                                    and straight hair, and green eyes; this limited the roles she was offered. She could
                                    not play mammy roles, and though she looked white, no acknowledged black was allowed
                                    to play a white person from the 1930's through the 1950's.

                                 <p><em>Imitation of Life</em> was remade in 1959 (Hunter &amp; Sirk). The plot is essentially the same; however, Peola
                                    is called Sara Jane, and she is played by Susan Kohner, a white actress. Delilah is
                                    now Annie Johnson. The pancake storyline is gone. Instead, the white mistress is a
                                    struggling actress. The crux of the story remains the light-skinned girl's attempts
                                    to pass for white. She runs away and becomes a chorus girl in a sleazy nightclub.
                                    Her dark skinned mother (played by Juanita Moore) follows her. She begs her mother
                                    to leave her alone. Sara Jane does not want to marry a "colored chauffeur"; she wants
                                    a white boyfriend. She gets a white boyfriend, but, when he discovers her secret,
                                    he savagely beats her and leaves her in a gutter. As in the original, Sara Jane's
                                    mother dies from a broken heart, and the repentant child tearfully returns to the
                                    funeral.

                                 <p>Peola and Sara Jane were cinematic tragic mulattoes. They were big screen testaments
                                    to the commonly held belief that "mixed blood" brought sorrow. If only they did not
                                    have a "drop of Negro blood." Many audience members nodded agreement when Annie Johnson
                                    asked rhetorically, "How do you explain to your daughter that she was born to hurt?"
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Were real mulattoes born to hurt? All racial minorities in the United States have
                                    been victimized by the dominant group, although the expressions of that oppression
                                    vary. Mulattoes were considered black; therefore, they were slaves along with their
                                    darker kinsmen. All slaves were "born to hurt," but some writers have argued that
                                    mulattoes were privileged, relative to dark-skinned blacks. E.B. Reuter (1919), a
                                    historian, wrote:
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <ul>In slavery days, they were most frequently the trained servants and had the advantages
                                    of daily contact with cultured men and women. Many of them were free and so enjoyed
                                    whatever advantages went with that superior status. They were considered by the white
                                    people to be superior in intelligence to the black Negroes, and came to take great
                                    pride in the fact of their white blood....When possible, they formed a sort of mixed-blood
                                    caste and held themselves aloof from the black Negroes and the slaves of lower status.

                                    "pure blacks" must be examined closely. American slavery lasted for more than two
                                    centuries; therefore, it is difficult to generalize about the institution. The interactions
                                    between slaveholder and slaves varied across decades--and from plantation to plantation.
                                    Nevertheless, there are clues regarding the status of mulattoes. In a variety of public
                                    statements and laws, the offspring of white-black sexual relations were referred to
                                    as "mongrels" or "spurious" (Nash, 1974, p. 287). Also, these interracial children
                                    were always legally defined as pure blacks, which was different from how they were
                                    handled in other New World countries. A slaveholder claimed that there was "not an
                                    old plantation in which the grandchildren of the owner [therefore mulattos] are not
                                    whipped in the field by his overseer" (Furnas, 1956, p. 142). Further, it seems that
                                    mulatto women were sometimes targeted for sexual abuse.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>According to the historian J. C. Furnas (1956), in some slave markets, mulattoes and
                                    quadroons brought higher prices, because of their use as sexual objects (p. 149).
                                    Some slavers found dark skin vulgar and repulsive. The mulatto approximated the white
                                    ideal of female attractiveness. All slave women (and men and children) were vulnerable
                                    to being raped, but the mulatto afforded the slave owner the opportunity to rape,
                                    with impunity, a woman who was physically white (or near-white) but legally black.
                                    A greater likelihood of being raped is certainly not an indication of favored status.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The mulatto woman was depicted as a seductress whose beauty drove white men to rape
                                    her. This is an obvious and flawed attempt to reconcile the prohibitions against miscegenation
                                    (interracial sexual relations) with the reality that whites routinely used blacks
                                    as sexual objects. One slaver noted, "There is not a likely looking girl in this State
                                    that is not the concubine of a White man..." (Furnas, 1956, p. 142). Every mulatto
                                    was proof that the color line had been crossed. In this regard, mulattoes were symbols
                                    of rape and concubinage. Gary B. Nash (1974) summarized the slavery-era relationship
                                    between the rape of black women, the handling of mulattoes, and white dominance:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> Though skin color came to assume importance through generations of association with
                                    slavery, white colonists developed few qualms about intimate contact with black women.
                                    But raising the social status of those who labored at the bottom of society and who
                                    were defined as abysmally inferior was a matter of serious concern. It was resolved
                                    by insuring that the mulatto would not occupy a position midway between white and
                                    black. Any black blood classified a person as black; and to be black was to be a slave....
                                    By prohibiting racial intermarriage, winking at interracial sex, and defining all
                                    mixed offspring as black, white society found the ideal answer to its labor needs,
                                    its extracurricular and inadmissible sexual desires, its compulsion to maintain its
                                    culture purebred, and the problem of maintaining, at least in theory, absolute social
                                    control. (pp. 289-290)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>George M. Fredrickson (1971), author of <em>The Black Image in the White Mind</em>, claimed that many white Americans believed that mulattoes were a degenerate race
                                    because they had "White blood" which made them ambitious and power hungry combined
                                    with "Black blood" which made them animalistic and savage. The attributing of personality
                                    and morality traits to "blood" seems foolish today, but it was taken seriously in
                                    the past. Charles Carroll, author of <em>The Negro a Beast</em> (1900), described blacks as apelike. Regarding mulattoes, the offspring of "unnatural
                                    relationships," they did not have "the right to live," because, Carroll said, they
                                    were the majority of rapists and killers (Fredrickson, 1971, p. 277). His claim was
                                    untrue but widely believed. In 1899 a southern white woman, L. H. Harris, wrote to
                                    the editor of the <em>Independent</em> that the "negro brute" who rapes white women was "nearly always a mulatto," with
                                    "enough white blood in him to replace native humility and cowardice with Caucasian
                                    audacity" (Fredrickson, 1971, p. 277). Mulatto women were depicted as emotionally
                                    troubled seducers and mulatto men as power hungry criminals. Nowhere are these depictions
                                    more evident than in D. W. Griffith's film <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> (1915).

                                 <p><em>The Birth of a Nation</em> is arguably the most racist mainstream movie produced in the United States. This
                                    melodrama of the Civil War and Reconstruction justified and glorified the Ku Klux
                                    Klan. Indeed, the Klan of the 1920s owes its existence to William Joseph Simmons,
                                    an itinerant Methodist preacher who watched the film a dozen times, then felt divinely
                                    inspired to resurrect the Klan which had been dormant since 1871. D. W. Griffith based
                                    the film on Thomas Dixon's anti-black novel <em>The Clansman</em> (1905) (also the original title of the movie). Griffith, following Dixon's lead,
                                    depicted his black characters as either "loyal darkies" or brutes and beasts lusting
                                    for power and, worse yet, lusting for white women.

                                 <p><em>The Birth of a Nation</em> tells the story of two families, the Stonemans of Pennsylvania, and the Camerons
                                    of South Carolina. The Stonemans, headed by politician Austin Stoneman, and the Camerons,
                                    headed by slaveholder "Little Colonel" Ben Cameron, have their longtime friendship
                                    divided by the Civil War. The Civil War exacts a terrible toll on both families: both
                                    have sons die in the war. The Camerons, like many slaveholders, suffer "ruin, devastation,
                                    rapine, and pillage." <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> depicts Radical Reconstruction as a time when blacks dominate and oppress whites.
                                    The film shows blacks pushing whites off sidewalks, snatching the possessions of whites,
                                    attempting to rape a white teenager, and killing blacks who are loyal to whites (Leab,
                                    1976, p. 28). Stoneman, a carpetbagger, moves his family to the South. He falls under
                                    the influence of Lydia, his mulatto housekeeper and mistress.

                                 <p>Austin Stoneman is portrayed as a naive politician who betrays his people: whites.
                                    Lydia, his lover, is described in a subtitle as the "weakness that is to blight a
                                    nation." Stoneman sends another mulatto, Silas Lynch, to "aid the carpetbaggers in
                                    organizing and wielding the power of the vote." Lynch, owing to his "white blood,"
                                    becomes ambitious. He and his agents rile the local blacks. They attack whites and
                                    pillage. Lynch becomes lieutenant governor, and his black co-conspirators are voted
                                    into statewide political offices. <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> shows black legislators debating a bill to legalize interracial marriage -- their
                                    legs propped on tables, eating chicken, and drinking whiskey.

                                 <p>Silas Lynch proposes marriage to Stoneman's daughter, Elsie. He says, "I will build
                                    a black empire and you as my queen shall rule by my side." When she refuses, he binds
                                    her and decides on a "forced marriage." Lynch informs Stoneman that he wants to marry
                                    a white woman. Stoneman approves until he discovers that the white woman is his daughter.
                                    While this drama unfolds, blacks attack whites. It looks hopeless until the newly
                                    formed Ku Klux Klan arrives to reestablish white rule.

                                 <p><em>The Birth of a Nation</em> set the standard for cinematic technical innovation -- the imaginative use of cross-cutting,
                                    lighting, editing, and close-ups. It also set the standard for cinematic anti-black
                                    images. All of the major black caricatures are in the movie, including, mammies, sambos,
                                    toms, picaninnies, coons, beasts, and tragic mulattoes. The depictions of Lydia --
                                    a cold-hearted, hateful seductress -- and Silas Lynch -- a power hungry, sex-obsessed
                                    criminal -- were early examples of the pathologies supposedly inherent in the tragic
                                    mulatto stereotype.

                                 <p>Mulattoes did not fare better in other books and movies, especially those who passed
                                    for white. In Nella Larsen's novel <em>Passing</em> (1929), Clare, a mulatto passing for white, frequently is drawn to blacks in Harlem.
                                    Her bigoted white husband finds her there. Her problems are solved when she falls
                                    to her death from a sixth story window. In the movie <em>Show Boat</em> (Laemmle &amp; Whale, 1936), a beautiful young entertainer, Julie, discovers that she
                                    has "Negro blood." Existing laws held that "one drop of Negro blood makes you a Negro."
                                    Her husband (and the movie's writers and producer) take this "one drop rule" literally.
                                    The husband cuts her hand with a knife and sucks her blood. This supposedly makes
                                    him a Negro. Afterward Julie and her newly-mulattoed husband walk hand-in-hand. Nevertheless,
                                    she is a screen mulatto, so the movie ends with this one-time cheerful "white" woman,
                                    now a Negro alcoholic.

                                 <p><em>Lost Boundaries</em> is a book by William L. White (1948), made into a movie in 1949 (de Rochemont &amp; Werker).
                                    It tells the story of a troubled mulatto couple, the Johnsons. The husband is a physician,
                                    but he cannot get a job in a southern black hospital because he "looks white," and
                                    no southern white hospital will hire him. The Johnsons move to New England and pass
                                    for white. They become pillars of their local community -- all the while terrified
                                    of being discredited. Years later, when their secret is discovered, the townspeople
                                    turn against them. The town's white minister delivers a sermon on racial tolerance
                                    which leads the locals, shamefaced and guilt-ridden, to befriend again the mulatto
                                    couple. <em>Lost Boundaries</em>, despite the white minister's sermon, blames the mulatto couple, not a racist culture,
                                    for the discrimination and personal conflicts faced by the Johnsons.

                                    involved with two American soldiers on leave from World War II. They are both infatuated
                                    with her until they discover that her father is black. Both men desert her. She attempts

                                    an arm, returns to the mulatto woman. They are comparable, both damaged, and it is

                                    white audiences would feel sympathy for a tortured white woman, even if she was portraying
                                    a mulatto character. The audience knew she was <em>really</em> white. In <em>Pinky</em> (Zanuck &amp; Kazan, 1949), Jeanne Crain, a well-known actress, played the role of the
                                    troubled mulatto. Her dark-skinned grandmother was played by Ethel Waters. When audiences
                                    saw Ethel Waters doing menial labor, it was consistent with their understanding of
                                    a mammy's life, but when Jeanne Crain was shown washing other people's clothes audiences
                                    cried.

                                 <p>Even black filmmakers like Oscar Micheaux made movies with tragic mulattoes. <em>Within Our Gates</em> (Micheaux, 1920) tells the story of a mulatto woman who is hit by a car, menaced
                                    by a con man, nearly raped by a white man, and witnesses the lynching of her entire
                                    family. <em>God's Step Children</em> (Micheaux, 1938) tells the story of Naomi, a mulatto who leaves her black husband
                                    and child and passes for white. Later, consumed by guilt, she commits suicide. Mulatto
                                    actresses played these roles.

                                 <p>Fredi Washington, the star of <em>Imitation of Life</em>, was one of the first cinematic tragic mulattoes. She was followed by women like
                                    Dorothy Dandridge and Nina Mae McKinney. Dandridge deserves special attention because
                                    she not only portrayed doomed, unfulfilled women, but she was the embodiment of the
                                    tragic mulatto in real life. Her role as the lead character in <em>Carmen Jones</em> (Preminger, 1954) helped make her a star. She was the first black featured on the
                                    cover of <em>Life</em> magazine. In <em>Island in the Sun</em> (Zanuck &amp; Rossen, 1957) she was the first black woman to be held -- lovingly -- in
                                    the arms of a white man in an American movie. She was a beautiful and talented actress,
                                    but Hollywood was not ready for a black leading lady; the only roles offered to her
                                    were variants of the tragic mulatto theme. Her personal life was filled with failed
                                    relationships. Disillusioned by roles that limited her to exotic, self-destructive
                                    mulatto types, she went to Europe, where she fared worse. She died in 1965, at the
                                    age of forty-two, from an overdose of anti-depressants.

                                    was made tragic in the minds of whites who reasoned that the greatest tragedy was
                                    to be near-white: so close, yet a racial gulf away. The near-white was to be pitied
                                    -- and shunned. There were undoubtedly light skinned blacks, male and female, who
                                    felt marginalized in this race conscious culture. This was true for many people of
                                    color, including dark skinned blacks. Self-hatred and intraracial hatred are not limited
                                    to light skinned blacks. There is evidence that all racial minorities in the United
                                    States have battled feelings of inferiority and in-group animosity; those are, unfortunately,
                                    the costs of being a minority.

                                    fitting into neither, accepted by neither. This is not true of real life mulattoes.
                                    Historically, mulattoes were not only accepted into the black community, but were
                                    often its leaders and spokespersons, both nationally and at neighborhood levels. Frederick
                                    Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, Booker T. Washington, Elizabeth Ross Hayes,<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>2</span></span></sup> Mary Church Terrell,<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>3</span></span></sup> Thurgood Marshall, Malcolm X, and Louis Farrakhan were all mulattoes. Walter White,
                                    the former head of the NAACP, and Adam Clayton Powell, an outspoken Congressman, were
                                    both light enough to pass for white. Other notable mulattoes include Langston Hughes,
                                    Billie Holiday, and Jean Toomer, author of <em>Cane</em> (1923), and the grandson of mulatto Reconstruction politician P.B.S. Pinchback.

                                 <p>There was tragedy in the lives of light skinned black women -- there was also tragedy
                                    in the lives of most dark skinned black women -- and men and children. The tragedy
                                    was not that they were black, or had a drop of "Negro blood," although whites saw
                                    that as a tragedy. Rather, the real tragedy was the way race was used to limit the
                                    chances of people of color. The 21st century finds an America increasingly more tolerant
