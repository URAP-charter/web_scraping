                                 The Nat caricature portrays African and African American males as angry, crazed, revengeful
                                 brutes with a bloodthirsty hatred for whites. Like many anti-black caricatures, the
                                 Nat portrayal was popularized during American slavery. John Wesley Blassingame, a
                                 prominent historian, reviewed slavery era literary stereotypes of black men and argued
                                 that three dominated: Sambo, a submissive, childlike buffoon; Jack, a sullen, rational
                                 pragmatist; and the hateful Nat. Blassingame (1972) contrasted the Sambo and Nat caricatures
                                 this way:
                                 
                                 <p><span style="font-family: Courier New;"> "Nat was the rebel who rivaled Sambo in the universality and continuity of his literary
                                       image. Revengeful, bloodthirsty, cunning, treacherous, and savage, Nat was the ravager
                                       of white women who defied all the rules of plantation society. Subdued and punished
                                       only when overcome by superior numbers of firepower, Nat retaliated when attacked
                                       by whites, led guerrilla activities of maroons against isolated plantations, killed
                                       overseers and planters, or burned plantation buildings when he was abused... Sambo,
                                       combining in his person Uncle Remus, Jim Crow, and Uncle Tom, was the most pervasive
                                       and long lasting of the three literary stereotypes. Indolent, faithful, humorous,
                                       loyal, dishonest, superstitious, improvident, and musical, Sambo was inevitably a
                                       clown and congenitally docile."</span></p>

                                         src="http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/nat/brute.jpg"

                                         height="231" /> Sambo was a devoted house servant; Nat, an angry field hand. Sambo's love for his
                                    "master" was all-consuming; Nat hated his enslaver. Sambo often gave his life to protect
                                    his master; Nat wanted to kill his enslaver.<br /><br /> Slavery was an institution brutal beyond words. How can one describe a system where
                                    humans are treated like chattel -- thinking, feeling animals? Slaves were property,
                                    legally real estate, sold in living rooms, churches, workplaces, and at public auction
                                    houses. Slaves were insulted, spat on, slapped, punched, kicked, and beaten for sport
                                    and "correction." In 1705, Virginia law stated, "If any slave resist his master...correcting
                                    such slave, and shall happen to be killed in such correction...the master shall be
                                    free of all punishment...as if such accident never happened." Slaves had no legal
                                    rights. They worked without wages. They could not legally marry. They were bred, their
                                    children, like themselves, chattel property. Imagine a society where you did not own
                                    yourself. At the whim of their enslavers they could be sold, separated from loved
                                    ones. Living under compulsory ignorance laws, slaves were beaten for learning to spell,
                                    read, and write. They could not own property without the permission of their enslavers.
                                    If they fled they were hunted, and when found, their backs whipped or their limbs
                                    amputated. Obviously, they could not own guns.<br /><br /> Think of what it would be like for one race to have complete domination over another
                                    race: a society where the "subordinate" race is considered inferiors, subhumans, lesser
                                    children of God. Imagine this racial hierarchy being supported by all major societal
                                    institutions: government, education, economy, religion, and family. There you would
                                    have an entire society aligned against a race -- all significant norms, values, beliefs,
                                    and laws legitimizing the victimization of the "subordinated others." There would,
                                    of course, be some enslavers who are relatively kind, but with little or no social
                                    control to regulate interactions between the superordinates (enslavers) and the subordinates,
                                    the abuses of power and their expressions would be staggering. It is not surprising
                                    that slaves, lacking real political, social, and economic power were often the victims
                                    of their enslavers' desires to satisfy scatological and sadistic fantasies. It is
                                    also not surprising that some slaves would hate their enslavers and want to physically
                                    assault or kill them.<br /><br /> Pro-slavery advocates may have tried to convince themselves and others that slavery
                                    was a benevolent institution and plantations were filled with obedient, docile Sambos,
                                    but Nats, real and imagined, dominated the white consciousness. One wealthy Louisiana
                                    enslaver stated, "I have known times here, when there was not a single planter (enslaver)
                                    who had a calm night's rest; they then never lay down to sleep without a brace of
                                    loaded pistols at their sides" (Bremer, 1853, p. 190). Whites, including non-enslavers,
                                    fearing rebellion among the slaves, used many strategies to ensure that angry slaves
                                    did not rebel: slaves were routinely searched for weapons; rebellious slaves were
                                    punished, publicly and harshly -- including cropping ears, castrating, hanging, burning,
                                    and mutilating; the all-white army and militias were constantly on guard; and, anyone,
                                    black or white advocating rebellion among the slaves could be lynched. Despite these
                                    measures and others, slavers lived with the constant fear that slaves would rise up
                                    and kill whites. According to Herbert Aptheker (1983), a historian, there were over
                                    two hundred and fifty documented cases of organized slave rebellions in the United
                                    States.<br /><br /></p>

                                 <p>The characterization of Africans and their American descendants as surly, crazed,
                                    subhumans capable of unspeakable violence is an old one, and this portrayal certainly
                                    was in vogue during the 18th century. This characterization went by many names, among
                                    them, Black Beast and Black Brute. In the 19th century a new name emerged, Nat, and
                                    its popularity was due almost totally to the bloody insurrection led by Nat Turner,
                                    a slave born in Southampton County, Virginia on October 2, 1800.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="float: right; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;"

                                         height="196" /> A precocious child, Turner picked up the ability to read at a young age and believed
                                    himself to be "intended for some great purpose." He grew up deeply religious and was
                                    often seen fasting and praying. At a young age he began preaching, and was known among
                                    fellow slaves as "The Prophet." Turner had several visions prior to the slave revolt
                                    in 1831. His first vision occurred in 1821, after he had run away. He hid in woods
                                    for thirty days until prompted by the vision to return to his enslaver. In 1825, seeing
                                    lights in the sky, he prayed to interpret the sign. He believed that his prayers were
                                    answered when he saw ". . . drops of blood on the corn, as though it were dew from
                                    heaven." He believed that this was a sign that there would be a war between "white
                                    spirits and black spirits."<br /><br /> On May 12, 1828, he had his third vision, in which he learned of his messianic role:
                                    to "fight against the Serpent" in the approaching eschaton: the end of days. He believed
                                    that the Spirit spoke to him and told him to fight the "Serpent." The Serpent, for
                                    him, meant whites. According to his vision, a sign from heaven would reveal when the
                                    revolt should take place. On February 12, 1831, a solar eclipse occurred, and Turner
                                    believed that this was a sign to begin planning an uprising. He was convinced of his
                                    mission to lead slaves out of bondage and developed a plan to capture the armory at
                                    Jerusalem, Virginia. He told four other slaves, and they planned the attack for July
                                    4, 1831. However, Turner got sick so the rebellion was postponed.<br /><br /> On August 13, 1831, there was an atmospheric disturbance in which the sun appeared
                                    bluish-green. Nat took this as the final signal. On August 21, 1831, Turner and several
                                    slaves arrived at the home of his enslaver and killed the entire white family. For
                                    the next forty hours, Turner and a growing number of slaves went house-to-house, freeing
                                    slaves, and stabbing and hacking to death between fifty-five and sixty white people.
                                    The slaves were on their way to Jerusalem to capture weapons. Overpowered by close
                                    to one thousand Virginia and federal military troops on the afternoon of August 22,
                                    Turner's forces disbanded. After a final battle with whites on the next morning, Turner
                                    escaped, hid, and was finally captured on October 30. He was taken to the county jail;
                                    while there he dictated his confession to Thomas R. Gray. On November 11, 1831 he
                                    was hanged, skinned, decapitated -- and his body parts amputated for souvenirs. In
                                    the aftermath of the rebellion, a hysterical climate reigned in the South, leading
                                    to mob lynching of blacks amid false accusations of conspiracy: close to two hundred
                                    blacks, many of whom had nothing to do with the rebellion, were beaten, bludgeoned,
                                    tortured, disemboweled, burned, and shot by the angry white mobs.<br /><br /> Nat Turner was one of the most polarizing figures in the history of this country.
                                    His slaughter of white civilians during the revolt makes his legacy controversial.
                                    Thomas Gray, the white attorney and slave owner who wrote down Turner's "Confession"
                                    with his own interpretation of Turner's thoughts, words, and actions, portrays Turner
                                    as a demented religious fanatic (Gray, 1831). This portrayal resonates with Turner's
                                    many detractors who see him as a cowardly mass murderer with a messiah complex. Similar
                                    sentiments are expressed in William Styron's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, <em>The Confessions of Nat Turner</em> (1967); Styron's Nat is also a white-woman obsessing sexual deviant. <em>William Styron's Nat Turner: Ten Black Writers Respond</em> (Clarke, 1968) is an angry rebuttal. The authors argue that Styron's Nat Turner is
                                    not the historical Nat Turner. Styron ignored Turner's relationships within the black
                                    community, and especially ignored Turner's wife. Nat Turner was, for them, a valiant
                                    man who acted rationally. He was not a crazed killer. He was a freedom fighter. The
                                    Nat Turner of William Styron's creation, they wrote, was a figment of Styron's own
                                    psychological conflicts rather than an accurate representation of an important historic
                                    figure. Albert Stone's <em>The Return of Nat Turner</em> (1992), also lauds Turner as a symbol of uncompromising militancy in the pursuit
                                    of freedom. To his supporters, Turner is a prophet, hero, Black Nationalist, warrior,
                                    and martyr who struck a blow against slavery. They are proud that a black man, against
                                    overwhelming odds, organized and carried out the bloodiest and most celebrated slave
                                    rebellion in the history of the United States. The revolt did not lead to permanent
                                    emancipation for slaves, but it did send this message to slaveholders: for years you
                                    have degraded and killed us, now there is the real possibility that we will kill you.<br /><br /> Though he became known as Nat Turner after the insurrection, his birth name was simply
                                    "Nat."<br /><br /></p>
                                 
                                 <h1><em><strong><span style="color: #800000; font-family: georgia,palatino;">Nat Today</span></strong></em></h1>
                                 
                                 <p>The America that birthed, shaped, beheaded, and quartered Nat Turner bears little
                                    resemblance to the United States of the 21st century. In part, this explains why the
                                    horrors of slavery are for many present-day Americans intellectually and emotionally
                                    unreachable. So much has happened: Emancipation, a Civil War, Reconstruction, the
                                    attempt to re-enslave blacks with Jim Crow laws, a Welfare Rights Movement, a televised
                                    Civil Rights Movement, Civil Rights Acts, The Black Power Movement, various harsh
                                    critiques of America's racial past, desegregation of public schools and public accommodations,
                                    integration of professional and collegiate sports, affirmative action, numerous racial
                                    reconciliation projects, and, a development that was inconceivable a half-century
                                    ago: Black politicians as serious candidates for the Presidency -- and much more.
                                    But African Americans remain a social minority: disproportionately poor, uneducated,
                                    unemployed, underemployed, sick, and incarcerated. There is a great deal of frustration
                                    and anger in many African American communities and some of that anger is expressed
                                    with hatred toward white Americans.<br /><br /> To the extent that real-life Nats -- or black men who approximate the Nat caricature
                                    -- exist, they are surely rare. There are many African American men (and women) who
                                    are frustrated with white racism and angry at whites; however, the Nat caricature
                                    includes the belief that whites should die, at the hands of blacks. Nat is more than
                                    a bigot; he is a revolutionary, and, in his mind, bloodless revolutions are not possible.
                                    Nat's hatred of whites cannot be explained by saying he is angry or prejudiced or
                                    discriminates; no, Nat's hatred is the hatred of despair and he wants to act on it.

                                    After the Katrina disaster Howard University hosted a conference to critique media
                                    coverage of Katrina and its after effects, especially the way the victims who remained
                                    were depicted. Kambon, one of the panelists, said the following to the assembled audience
                                    and the C-SPAN television audience:
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p><span style="font-family: Courier New;"> "And then finally I want to say that we need one idea, and we're not thinking about
                                       a solution to the problem.... Now how do I know that the white people know that we
                                       are going to come up with a solution to the problem? I know it because they have retina
                                       scans, they have what they call racial profiling, DNA banks, and they're monitoring
                                       our people to try to prevent the one person from coming up with the one idea. And
                                       the one idea is, how we are going to exterminate white people because that in my estimation
                                       is the only conclusion I have come to. We have to exterminate white people off the
                                       face of the planet to solve this problem. Now I don't care whether you clap or not,

                                       kill us. And I will leave on that. So we just have to just set up our own system and
                                       stop playing and get very serious and not be diverted from coming up with a solution

                                 <p>Prior to his call for genocide against whites, Kambon told the panel that "we are
                                    at war." He said that whites had set up an "international plantation" for blacks,
                                    which made "every white person on earth a plantation master." He said that, "You're
                                    either supporting white people in their process of death, or you're for African liberation"
                                    (Kamau Kambon, 2005).<br /><br /> Kambon's hatred of whites parallels the hatred of blacks and other "mud people" by
                                    white supremacy groups. Their hatred does not represent different, polar points on
                                    a continuum; rather, they are at or near the same point on a circle. Black supremacists
                                    like Kambon and their white supremacist counterparts want to defeat, degrade, and
                                    destroy; they do not want separation, they want annihilation. They may do it, in the
                                    words of Tom Metzger, a notorious white supremacist, as "lone wolves,"<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>2</span></span></sup> but their preference is to be victors in a race war.<br /><br /> <img class="imgl" style="float: left; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;"

                                    begun. It had not. In 2002, Resistance Records, owned by the National Alliance, a
                                    neo-Nazi organization, begin distributing a CD-ROM based computer game called "Ethnic
                                    Cleansing." The object is to kill "sub-humans" -- i.e. blacks and Latinos -- and their
                                    "masters," the Jews, who are portrayed as the personification of evil. The game is
                                    a virtual race war. The call for a race war has also been advocated by Black Jews
                                    and some individuals associated with the Nation of Islam.<br /><br /> America is not a racial paradise and one's life chances -- the likelihood of getting
                                    the good things in life, power, prestige, property, and presumed worth -- are not
                                    equally distributed across racial lines. Indeed, race remains a "master status," meaning,
                                    that social status that trumps an individual's other statuses. Nevertheless, there
                                    has been a great deal of progress in this country since the time of Nat Turner. There
                                    is still a racial divide but the United States is more democratic than it was even
                                    forty years ago. The anger and hatred that once dominated American race relations
                                    has not disappeared but it no longer dominates, this means that Nat and his white
                                    Counterpart -- let us call him Joseph Paul, are marginalized; ironically, that marginalization
                                    fuels them.<br /><br /> ©David Pilgrim<br /> Curator, Jim Crow Museum <br /> July 2007<br /> Edited 2012

                                    people; but buy my record first; ha, ha, ha." <strong>"Kill d'White People"; Apache, <em>Apache Ain't Sh*t</em>, 1993, Tommy Boy Music, Time Warner, USA</strong>. "Lead to the head of you devils." <strong>"Lick Dem Mutha*****as--Remix"; Brand Nubian, <em>Everything Is Everything</em>, 1994, Elektra Entertainment, Warner Communications, Time Warner, USA</strong>. "Get them devil-made guns and leave them demons bleeding; give them back whips,

                                    a killing spree, putting devils out their misery; hearing screams, sounds of agony;

                                 <p><sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>2</span></span></sup> Think of Colin Ferguson, the mentally troubled black man, convicted of murdering
                                    six people and injuring nineteen others on the Long Island Rail Road in Garden City,
                                    New York on December 7, 1993. Ferguson's defense team had proposed the defense that
                                    he had been driven to temporary insanity by black rage, and that he was not criminally
                                    liable, even though he had committed the killings. Ferguson insisted that he had not
                                    committed the killings and chose to represent himself. Or think of Joseph Paul Franklin,
                                    equally deranged, born James Clayton Vaughn in Mobile, Alabama in 1950. Obsessed with
                                    Nazism while in high school, he started off firebombing synagogues and spraying mace
                                    on inter-racial couples, he soon graduated to murder. He committed over twenty murders
                                    in twelve states, mostly Jews and black men who dated or married whites. Franklin
                                    shot and paralyzed Larry Flynt, publisher of "Hustler," because the magazine dedicated
                                    an issue to interracial sex. In 1980, Franklin shot and wounded African American attorney
                                    Vernon Jordan, then president of the National Urban League, a civil rights organization,
                                    and later a close advisor to President Bill Clinton, because Jordan was jogging with
                                    a white woman. Franklin, who considered himself a serial assassin, said: "I was commanded
                                    by God to start a race war."
