                                      height="262" /> The coon caricature is one of the most insulting of all anti-black caricatures. The
                                 name itself, an abbreviation of raccoon, is dehumanizing. As with Sambo, the coon
                                 was portrayed as a lazy, easily frightened, chronically idle, inarticulate, buffoon.
                                 The coon differed from the Sambo in subtle but important ways. Sambo was depicted
                                 as a perpetual child, not capable of living as an independent adult. The coon acted
                                 childish, but he was an adult; albeit a good-for-little adult. Sambo was portrayed
                                 as a loyal and contented servant. Indeed, Sambo was offered as a defense for slavery
                                 and segregation. How bad could these institutions have been, asked the racialists,
                                 if blacks were contented, even happy, being servants? The coon, although he often
                                 worked as a servant, was not happy with his status. He was, simply, too lazy or too
                                 cynical to attempt to change his lowly position. Also, by the 1900s, Sambo was identified
                                 with older, docile blacks who accepted Jim Crow laws and etiquette; whereas coons
                                 were increasingly identified with young, urban blacks who disrespected whites. Stated
                                 differently, the coon was a Sambo gone bad.
                                 
                                 <p>The prototypical movie coon was Stepin Fetchit, the slow-talking, slow-walking, self-demeaning
                                    nitwit. It took his character almost a minute to say: "I'se be catchin' ma feets nah,
                                    Boss." Donald Bogle (1994), a cinema historian, lambasted the coon, as played by Stepin
                                    Fetchit and others:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> Before its death, the coon developed into the most blatantly degrading of all black
                                    stereotypes. The pure coons emerged as no-account niggers, those unreliable, crazy,
                                    lazy, subhuman creatures good for nothing more than eating watermelons, stealing chickens,
                                    shooting crap, or butchering the English language. (p. 8)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>The coon caricature was born during American slavery. Slave masters and overseers
                                    often described slaves as "slow," "lazy," "wants pushing," "an eye servant," and "trifling."<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>1</span></span></sup> The master and the slave operated with different motives: the master desired to obtain
                                    from the slave the greatest labor, by any means; the slave desired to do the least
                                    labor while avoiding punishment. The slave registered his protest against slavery
                                    by running away, and, when that was not possible, by slowing work, doing shoddy work,
                                    destroying work tools, and faking illness. Slave masters attributed the slaves' poor
                                    work performance to shiftlessness, stupidity, desire for freedom, and genetic deficiencies.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p><img class="imgl" style="float: right; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;"

                                    slave owners and their ability to extract labor. Typically, slaves worked from dawn
                                    to dusk. They were sometimes granted "leisure time" on Saturday or Sunday evenings;
                                    however, this time was spent planting or harvesting their own gardens, washing clothes,
                                    cooking, and cleaning. A slave owner wrote: "I always give them half of each Saturday,
                                    and often the whole day, at which time...the women do their household work; therefore
                                    they are never idle" (Stampp, 1956, pp. 79-80)

                                 <p>Slave owners complained about the laziness of their workers, but the records show
                                    that slaves were often worked hard -- and brutally so. Overseers were routinely paid
                                    commissions, which encouraged them to overwork the slaves. On a North Carolina plantation
                                    an overseer claimed that he was a "'hole hog man rain or shine," and boasted that
                                    the slaves had been worked "like horses." He added, "I'd ruther be dead than be a
                                    nigger on one of these big plantations" (Stampp, 1956, p. 85). After the closing of
                                    the African slave trade, the price of slaves went up, thereby causing some slave owners
                                    and their hired overseers to be more careful in their use of slaves. "The time had
                                    been," wrote one slave owner, "that the farmer could kill up and wear out one Negro
                                    to buy another; but it is not so now. Negroes are too high in proportion to the price
                                    of cotton, and it behooves those who own them to make them last as long as possible"
                                    (Stampp, 1956, p. 81).

                                 <p>Slaves are generally associated with the harvest of cotton; however, slaves worked
                                    in many industries. Almost every railroad in the ante-bellum South was built in part
                                    by slave labor. Slaves worked in sawmills, fisheries, gold mines and salt mines. They
                                    were used as deck hands on river boats. There were slave lumberjacks, construction
                                    workers, longshoremen, iron workers, even store clerks. Slaves monopolized the domestic
                                    services. Some slaves worked as skilled artisans, for example, shoemakers, blacksmiths,
                                    carpenters, mechanics, and barbers. These artisans were generally treated better than
                                    the slaves in the cotton and tobacco fields; therefore, it is not surprising that
                                    the artisans did better work. They included "many ingenious Mechanicks," claimed a
                                    white colonial Georgian, "and as far as they have had opportunity of being instructed,
                                    have discovered as good abilities, as are usually found among [white] people of our
                                    Colony" (Stampp, 1956, p. 63).
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The supporters of slavery claimed that blacks were a childlike people unequipped for
                                    freedom. Proslavers acknowledged that some slave masters were cruel, but they argued
                                    that most were benevolent, kind-hearted capitalists who civilized and improved their
                                    docile black wards. From Radical Reconstruction to World War I, there was a national
                                    nostalgia for the "good ol' darkies" who loved their masters, and, according to the
                                    proslavers, rejected or only reluctantly accepted emancipation. In this context, the
                                    conceptualization of the coon was revised. During slavery almost all blacks, especially
                                    men, were sometimes seen as coons, that is, lazy, shiftless, and virtually useless.
                                    However, after slavery, the coon caricature was increasingly applied to younger blacks,
                                    especially those who were urban, flamboyant, and contemptuous of whites. Thomas Nelson
                                    Page, a white writer wrote this in 1904:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> Universally, they [white Southerners] will tell you that while the old-time Negroes
                                    were industrious, saving, and when not misled, well-behaved, kindly, respectful, and
                                    self-respecting, and while the remnant of them who remain still retain generally these
                                    characteristics, the "new issue," for the most part, are lazy, thriftless, intemperate,
                                    insolent, dishonest, and without the most rudimentary elements of morality....Universally,

                                 <p>At the beginning of the 1900s many whites supported the implementation of Jim Crow
                                    laws and etiquette. They believed that blacks were genetically, therefore permanently,
                                    inferior to whites. Blacks were, they argued, hedonistic children, irresponsible,
                                    and left to their own plans, destined for idleness -- or worse. It was not uncommon
                                    for whites to distinguish between <em>Niggers</em> (Coons and Bucks) and <em>Negroes</em> (Toms, Sambos, and Mammies), and they preferred the latter.

                                    as coons continued throughout the 20th Century. The pioneer study of racial and ethnic
                                    stereotyping in the United States was conducted in 1933 by Daniel Katz and Kenneth
                                    Braley, two social scientists. They questioned 100 Princeton University undergraduates
                                    regarding the prevailing stereotypes of racial and ethnic groups. Their research concluded
                                    that blacks were consistently described as "superstitious," "happy-go-lucky," and
                                    "lazy." The respondents had these views even though they had little or no contact
                                    with blacks. This study was repeated in 1951, and the negative stereotyping of blacks
                                    persisted (Gilbert). The Civil Rights Movement improved whites' attitudes toward blacks,
                                    but a sizeable minority of whites still hold traditional, racist views of blacks.
                                    An early 1990s study conducted by the National Opinion Research Center found that
                                    the majority of the white, Hispanic, and other non-black respondents displayed negative
                                    attitudes towards blacks. For example, 78 percent said that blacks were more likely
                                    than whites to "prefer to live off welfare" and "less likely to prefer to be self-supporting."
                                    Further, 62 percent said blacks were more likely to be lazy; 56 percent said blacks
                                    were violence-prone; and 53 percent said that blacks were less intelligent than whites
                                    (Duke, 1991). Stated differently: the coon caricature is still being applied to blacks.
                                    Martin Gilens (1999), a Yale University political scientist, argued that many white
                                    Americans believe that blacks receive welfare benefits more often than do whites and
                                    that "the centuries old stereotype of blacks as lazy remains credible for a large
                                    number of white Americans." He claimed that opposition to welfare programs results
                                    from misinformation and racism, with whites assuming that their tax money is being
                                    used to support lazy blacks. Gilens blames, in part, the media. "Pictures of poor
                                    blacks are abundant when poverty coverage is most negative, while pictures of non-blacks
                                    dominate the more sympathetic coverage."
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The coon caricature was one of the stock characters among minstrel performers. Minstrel
                                    show audiences laughed at the slow-talking fool who avoided work and all adult responsibilities.
                                    This transformed the coon into a comic figure, a source of bitter and vulgar comic
                                    relief. He was sometimes renamed "Zip Coon" or "Urban Coon." If the minstrel skit
                                    had an ante-bellum setting, the coon was portrayed as a free black; if the skit's
                                    setting postdated slavery, he was portrayed as an urban black. He remained lazy and
                                    good-for-little, but the minstrel shows depicted him as a gaudy dressed "Dandy" who
                                    "put on airs." Unlike Mammy and Sambo, Coon did not know his place. He thought he
                                    was as smart as white people; however, his frequent malapropisms and distorted logic
                                    suggested that his attempt to compete intellectually with whites was pathetic. His
                                    use of bastardized English delighted white audiences and reaffirmed the then commonly
                                    held beliefs that blacks were inherently less intelligent. The minstrel coon's goal
                                    was leisure, and his leisure was spent strutting, styling, fighting, avoiding real
                                    work, eating watermelons, and making a fool of himself. If he was married, his wife
                                    dominated him. If he was single, he sought to please the flesh without entanglements.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Hollywood films extended the brutalization inherent in the coon image. The first cinematic
                                    coon appeared in <em>Wooing and Wedding of a Coon </em>(Selig, 1905), a stupendously racist portrayal of two dimwitted and stuttering buffoons.
                                    Several notable slapstick "coon shorts" were produced in 1910-1911, including <em>How Rastus Got His Turkey</em> (Wharton, 1910) (he stole it) and <em>Chicken Thief</em> (1911). In the blackface comedy <em>Coon Town Suffragettes</em> (Lubin, 1914), a group of domineering mammies organize a "movement" to keep their
                                    good-for-nothing husbands at home. These early coons laid the foundation for the "great"
                                    movie coons of the 1930s and 1940s.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>In the 1929 Fox film <em>Hearts in Dixie</em> (Sloane), Chloe is married to Gummy, a "languid, shiftless husband whose 'mysery'
                                    in his feet prevents him from being of any earthly good as far as work is concerned,
                                    although once away from his wife's eye he can shuffle with the tirelessness and lanky
                                    abandon of a jumping jack" (Leab, 1976, p. 86). Chloe dies of swamp fever, and Gummy
                                    remarries. The new wife is portrayed as a shrew because she tries to force Gummy to
                                    work. This movie was a comedy, and most of the humor centered around Gummy's attempts
                                    to avoid work and his coon dialogue, for example, "I ain't askin you is you ain't.
                                    I is askin you is you is." The actor who played Gummy was Stepin Fetchit, the "greatest"
                                    coon actor of all time.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Stepin Fetchit was born Lincoln Theodore Perry on May 30, 1892. A medicine show and
                                    vaudeville performer, he arrived in Hollywood in the 1920s. Perry claimed that he
                                    got the name Fetchit from a racehorse that won him money. However, he also told an
                                    interviewer that he came to Hollywood as a member of a comedy team know as "Step and
                                    Fetch It," and later adopted a variant of the name. His first featured movie role
                                    using the name Stepin Fetchit was in MGM's <em>In Old Kentucky</em> (Stahl, 1927). Whether as Gummy, Stepin Fetchit, or other names, he essentially performed
                                    the same role: the arch-coon. Daniel J. Leab (1976), a cinema historian, said this:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> Fetchit became identified in the popular imagination as a dialect-speaking, slump-shouldered,
                                    slack-jawed character who walked, talked, and apparently thought in slow motion. The
                                    Fetchit character overcame this lethargy only when he thought that a ghost or some
                                    nameless terror might be present; and then he moved very quickly indeed. (p. 89)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>Fetchit was the embodiment of the nitwit black man. As with the Zip Coon and Urban
                                    Coon, this old-fashioned coon character could never correctly pronounce a multisyllabic
                                    word. He was portrayed as a dunce. In <em>Stand Up and Cheer</em> (Sheehan &amp; MacFadden, 1934), he was tricked into thinking that a "talking" penguin
                                    was really Jimmy Durante. Fetchit, scratching his head, eyes bulging, portrayed the
                                    coon so realistically that whites thought they were seeing a real racial type. His
                                    coon portrayal was aided by his appearance. According to Donald Bogle (1994), a film
                                    historian:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> His appearance, too, added to the caricature. He was tall and skinny and always had
                                    his head shaved completely bald. He invariably wore clothes that were too large for
                                    him and that looked as if they had been passed down from his white master. His grin
                                    was always very wide, his teeth very white, his eyes very widened, his feet very large,
                                    his walk very slow, his dialect very broken. (P. 41)</span>

                                    abused by white characters. In <em>David Harum</em> (Cruze, 1934) he was traded to Will Rogers along with a horse. He was traded twice
                                    more in the movie. In <em>Judge Priest</em> (Wurtzel &amp; Ford, 1934), he was pushed, shoved, and verbally berated by Will Rogers;
                                    even worse, his character was barely intelligible, scratched his head in an apelike
                                    manner, and followed Rogers around like an adoring pet.

                                 <p>In black communities, Stepin Fetchit remains a synonym for a bowing and scraping black
                                    man. In 1970 he sued CBS unsuccessfully for $3 million, charging defamation of character
                                    for the way he was portrayed in the television documentary <em>Black History: Lost, Stolen, or Strayed</em> (Rooney, 1968). "It was Step," he claimed, "who elevated the Negro to the dignity
                                    of a Hollywood star. I made the Negro a first-class citizen all over the world...somebody
                                    it was all right to associate with. I opened all the theaters" (Bogle, 1994, p. 44).
                                    That statement is hyperbole; however, Stepin Fetchit was a talented actor who added
                                    depth -- albeit, slight -- to the movie coon's portrayal.

                                         height="315" /> What is his legacy? He was the first black actor to receive top billing in movies,
                                    and one of the first millionaire black actors. He spawned imitators, most notably,
                                    Willie Best (Sleep 'n Eat) and Mantan Moreland, the scared, wide-eyed manservant of
                                    Charlie Chan. In 1978 he was elected to the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame. But he
                                    will always be remembered as the lazy, barely literate, self-demeaning, white man's
                                    black. He attempted a comeback in the 1950s, but it was unsuccessful; his coon caricature
                                    then seemed merely embarrassing. In the late 1960s he converted to the Black Muslim
                                    faith.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>In 1999 Fetchit's name was again in the headlines. <em>Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace</em> (McCallum &amp; Lucas) included a character named Jar Jar Binks. Critics claimed that
                                    Jar Jar, a bumbling dimwitted amphibian-like character, spoke Caribbean-accented pidgin
                                    English, and had ears that suggested dreadlocks. Wearing bellbottom pants and vest,
                                    Jar Jar looked like the latest in black cinematic stereotypes. Newspaper editorials
                                    and internet chat room discussions repeatedly invoked Stepin Fetchit's name. For example,
                                    Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal described Jar Jar as a "Rastafarian Stepin
                                    Fetchit on platform hoofs, crossed annoyingly with Butterfly McQueen" (Fleeman, 1999).
                                    This incident suggests that Fetchit's legacy is to be remembered as a coon caricature:
