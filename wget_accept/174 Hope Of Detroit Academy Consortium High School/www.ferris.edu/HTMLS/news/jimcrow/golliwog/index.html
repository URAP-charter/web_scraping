                                 caricatures in the United States. Golliwogs are grotesque creatures,<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>1</span></span></sup> with very dark, often jet black skin, large white-rimmed eyes, red or white clown
                                 lips, and wild, frizzy hair.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>2</span></span></sup> Typically, it's a male dressed in a jacket, trousers, bow tie, and stand-up collar
                                 in a combination of red, white, blue, and occasionally yellow colors. The golliwog
                                 image, popular in England and other European countries, is found on a variety of items,
                                 including postcards, jam jars, paperweights, brooches, wallets, perfume bottles, wooden
                                 puzzles, sheet music, wall paper, pottery, jewelry, greeting cards, clocks, and dolls.
                                 For the past four decades Europeans have debated whether the Golliwog is a lovable
                                 icon or a racist symbol.
                                 
                                 <p>The Golliwog began life as a story book character created by Florence Kate Upton.
                                    Upton was born in 1873 in Flushing, New York, to English parents who had emigrated
                                    to the United States in 1870. She was the second of four children. When Upton was
                                    fourteen, her father died and, shortly thereafter, the family returned to England.
                                    For several years she honed her skills as an artist. Unable to afford art school,
                                    Upton illustrated her own children's book in the hope of raising tuition money.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>In 1895, her book, entitled <em>The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls</em>, was published in London. Upton drew the illustrations, and her mother, Bertha Upton,
                                    wrote the accompanying verse. The book's main characters were two Dutch dolls, Peg
                                    and Sarah Jane, and the Golliwogg. The story begins with Peg and Sara Jane, on the
                                    loose in a toy shop, encountering "a horrid sight, the blackest gnome." The little
                                    black "gnome" wore bright red trousers, a red bow tie on a high collared white shirt,
                                    and a blue swallow-tailed coat. He was a caricature of American black faced minstrels
                                    -- in effect, the caricature of a caricature. She named him Golliwogg.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The Golliwogg was based on a Black minstrel doll that Upton had played with as a small
                                    child in New York. The then-nameless "Negro minstrel doll" was treated roughly by
                                    the Upton children. Upton reminiscenced: "Seated upon a flowerpot in the garden, his
                                    kindly face was a target for rubber balls..., the game being to knock him over backwards.
                                    It pains me now to think of those little rag legs flying ignominiously over his head,
                                    yet that was a long time ago, and before he had become a personality.... We knew he
                                    was ugly!" (Johnson).
                                 </p>

                                    often drawn with paws instead of hands and feet. He had a coal black face, thick lips,
                                    wide eyes, and a mass of long unruly hair.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>3</span></span></sup> He was a cross between a dwarf-sized black minstrel and an animal. The appearance
                                    was distorted and frightening (MacGregor, p. 125).

                                 <p>Florence Upton's ugly little creation was embraced by the English public. <em>The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls</em> was immensely popular in England, and Golliwogg became a national star. The second
                                    printing of the book was retitled <em>The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg</em>. For the next fourteen years, Bertha and Florence Upton created twelve more books
                                    featuring the Golliwogg and his adventures, traveling to such "exotic" places as Africa
                                    and the North Pole, accompanied by his friends, the Dutch Dolls ("Golliwog History",
                                    n.d.). In those books the Uptons put the Golliwogg first in every title.

                                 <p>The Uptons did not copyright the Golliwogg, and the image entered into public domain.
                                    The Golliwogg name was changed to Golliwog, and he became a common toyland character
                                    in children's books. The Upton Golliwogg was adventurous and sometimes silly, but,
                                    in the main, gallant and "lovable," albeit, unsightly. Later Golliwogs were often
                                    unkind, mean-spirited, and even more visually hideous.

                                 <p>The earliest Golliwog dolls were rag dolls made by parents for their children. Many
                                    thousands were made. During the early twentieth century, many prominent doll manufacturers
                                    began producing Golliwog dolls. The major Golliwog producers were Steiff, Schuco,
                                    and Levin, all three Germany companies, and Merrythought and Deans, both from Great
                                    Britain. The Steiff Company is the most notable maker of Golliwog dolls. In 1908 Steiff
                                    became the first company to mass produce and distribute Golliwog dolls. Today, these
                                    early Steiff dolls sell for $10,000 to $15,000 each, making them the most expensive
                                    Golliwog collectibles. Some Steiff Golliwogs have been especially offensive, for example,
                                    in the 1970s they produced a Golliwog who looked like a wooly haired gorilla. In 1995,
                                    on the 100th anniversary of the Golliwog creation, Steiff produced two Golliwog dolls,
                                    including the company's first girl Golliwog.

                                 <p>James Robertson &amp; Sons, a British manufacturer of jams and preserves, began using
                                    the Golliwog as its trademark in the early 1900s. According to the company's promotional
                                    literature, it was in the United States, just before World War I, that John Robertson
                                    (the owner's son) first encountered the Golly doll. He saw rural children playing
                                    with little black rag dolls with white eyes. The children's mothers made the dolls
                                    from discarded black skirts and blouses. John Robertson claimed that the children
                                    called the dolls "Golly" as a mispronunciation of "Dolly." He returned to England
                                    with the Golly name and image.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>By 1910 the Golly appeared on Robertson's product labels, price lists, and advertising
                                    material. Its appeal led to an enormously popular mail-away campaign: in return for
                                    coupons from their marmalade, Robertson's sent brooches (also called pins or badges)
                                    of Gollies playing various sports. The first brooch was the Golly Golfer in 1928 ("Gollies
                                    Through History," n.d.). In 1932 a series of fruit badges (with Golly heads superimposed
                                    onto the berries) were distributed. In 1939 the popular brooch series was discontinued
                                    because the metal was needed for the war effort,<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>4</span></span></sup> but by 1946 the Golly returned. In 1999 a Robertson spokesperson said, "He's still
                                    very popular. Each year we get more than 340,000 requests for Golly badges. Since
                                    1910 we have sent out more than 20 million" (Clark). The Robertson Golly has also
                                    appeared on pencils, knitting patterns, playing cards, aprons, and children's silverware
                                    sets.

                                 <p>Robertson pendant chains were introduced in 1956, and, soon after, the design of all
                                    Robertson Gollies changed from the Old Golly with pop eyes to the present Golly with
                                    eyes looking to the left. The words "Golden Shred" were removed from his waistcoat,
                                    his eyes were straightened, and his smile was broadened ("And There's Even More: history",

                                    children's soft toy in Europe. Only the Teddy Bear exceeded the Golliwog in popularity.
                                    Small children slept with their black dolls. Many white Europeans still speak with
                                    nostalgic sentiment about their childhood gollies. Sir Kenneth Clark, the noted art
                                    historian, claimed that the Golliwogs of his childhood were, "examples of chivalry,
                                    far more persuasive than the unconvincing Knights of the Arthurian legend" (Johnson,
                                    n.d., p. 3). The French composer Claude Debussy was so enthralled by the Golliwogs
                                    in his daughter's books that one movement of his <em>Children's Corner</em> Suite is entitled "The Golliwog's Cakewalk" (Johnson, n.d., p. 3). The Golliwog was
                                    a mixture of bravery, adventurousness, and love -- for white children.

                                 <p>In the 1960s relations between blacks and whites in England were often characterized
                                    by conflict. This racial antagonism resulted from many factors, including: the arrival
                                    of increasing numbers of colored immigrants; minorities' unwillingness to accommodate
                                    themselves to old patterns of racial and ethnic subordination; and, the fear among
                                    many whites that England was losing its national character. British culture was also
                                    influenced by images -- often brutal -- of racial conflict occurring in the United
                                    States.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>In this climate the Golliwog doll and other Golliwog emblems were seen as symbols
                                    of racial insensitivity. Many books containing Golliwogs were withdrawn from public
                                    libraries, and the manufacturing of Golliwog dolls dwindled as the demand for Golliwogs
                                    decreased. Many items with Golliwog images were destroyed. Despite much criticism,
                                    James Robertson &amp; Sons did not discontinue its use of the Golliwog as a mascot. The
                                    Camden Committee for Community Relations led a petition drive for signatures to send
                                    to the Robertson Company. The National Committee on Racism in Children's Books also
                                    publicly criticized Robertson's use of the Golly in its advertising. Other organizations
                                    called for a boycott of Robertson's products; nevertheless, the company has continued
                                    to use the Golliwog as its trademark in many countries, including the United Kingdom,
                                    although it was removed from Robertson's packaging in the United States, Canada, and
                                    Hong Kong.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>In many ways the campaign to ban Golliwogs was similar to the American campaign against
                                    <em>Little Black Sambo</em>. In both cases racial minorities and sympathetic whites argued that these images
                                    demeaned blacks and hurt the psyches of minority children. Civil rights organizations
                                    led both campaigns, and white civic and political leaders eventually joined the effort
                                    to ban the offensive caricatures. In the anti-Golliwog campaign, numerous British
                                    parliamentarians publicly lambasted the Golliwog image as racist, including, Tony
                                    Benn, Shirley Williams, and David Owen (MacGregor, 1992, p. 29).

                                 <p>The claim that Golliwogs are racist is supported by literary depictions by writers
                                    such as Enid Blyton. Unlike Florence Upton's, Blyton's Golliwogs were often rude,
                                    mischievous, elfin villains. In Blyton's book, <em>Here Comes Noddy Again</em> (1951), a Golliwog asks the hero for help, then steals his car. Blyton, one of the
                                    most prolific European writers, included the Golliwogs in many stories, but she only
                                    wrote three books primarily about Golliwogs: <em>The Three Golliwogs</em> (1944), <em>The Proud Golliwog</em> (1951), and <em>The Golliwog Grumbled</em> (1955). Her depictions of Golliwogs are, by contemporary standards, racially insensitive.
                                    An excerpt from The Three Golliwogs is illustrative:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> Once the three bold golliwogs, Golly, Woggie, and Nigger, decided to go for a walk
                                    to Bumble-Bee Common. Golly wasn't quite ready so Woggie and Nigger said they would
                                    start off without him, and Golly would catch them up as soon as he could. So off went
                                    Woogie and Nigger, arm-in-arm, singing merrily their favourite song -- which, as you
                                    may guess, was <em>Ten Little Nigger Boys</em>.(p. 51)</span>

                                    of ten Black children, one-by-one. <em>The Three Golliwogs</em> was reprinted as recently as 1968, and it still contained the above passage. <em>Ten Little Niggers</em><sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>5</span></span></sup> was also the name of a 1939 Agatha Christie novel, whose cover showed a Golliwog
                                    lynched, hanging from a noose.

                                 <p>The Golliwog's reputation and popularity were also hurt by the association with the
                                    word <em>wog</em>. Apparently derived from the word Golliwog,<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>6</span></span></sup> wog is an English slur against dark-skinned people, especially Middle or Far East
                                    foreigners. During World War II the word <em>wog</em> was used by the British Army in North Africa, mainly as a slur against dark-skinned
                                    Arabs. In the 1960s the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, one of the most noted regiments
                                    in the British Army, wore a Robertson's golly brooch for each Arab they had killed
                                    ("And There's Even More: Golly", n.d.) After the war, wog became a more general slur
                                    against brown-skinned people. As a racial epithet, it is comparable to <em>nigger</em> or <em>spic</em>, though its usage extends beyond any single ethnic group. Dark-skinned people in
                                    England, Germany, and Australia are derisively called wogs.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>7</span></span></sup> In the year 2000, a British police officer was fired for referring to an Asian colleague
                                    as a wog ("British policeman", 2000). The association of wog with racial minorities
                                    is also seen with the word <em>wog-box</em>, which is slang for a large portable music box, the European counterpart of the <em>ghetto blaster</em>. The wog-box is also called a "Third World briefcase" (Green, 1984, p. 309).

                                 <p>Some Golliwog supporters tried to distance themselves from the wog slur by dropping
                                    it from the word <em>golliwog</em>. James Robertson &amp; Sons, for example, has always referred to its golliwog as "Golly."
                                    In the late 1980s, when the anti-Golliwog campaign reached its height, many small
                                    manufacturers of the golliwogs began using the names Golly or Golli, instead of Golliwog.
                                    Not surprisingly, the words Golliwog, Golly, and Golli are now all used as racially
                                    descriptive terms, although they are not as demeaning as <em>wog</em>.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p><em>Golliwog</em> is a racial slur in Germany, England, Ireland, Greece, and Australia. Interestingly,
                                    it is sometimes applied to dark-skinned whites, as well as brown-skinned persons.
                                    Golliwog is also a common name for black pets, especially dogs, in European countries
                                    -- much as <em>nigger</em> was once popular as a pet name. Golliwog was also the original name of the rock band
                                    Credence Clearwater Revival. They sometimes performed the song "Brown-Eyed Girl" (not
                                    the Van Morrison tune), dressed in white afros. This is not to suggest that they were
                                    racists, only to show that golliwogs were a part -- albeit, a small one -- in American
                                    culture ("Brief History", n.d.).

                                    which always had a loyal following, again boomed on the secondary market. This popularity
                                    continues today and is evidenced by numerous eBay and Yahoo internet auctions and
                                    the presence of several international Golliwog organizations. A pro-Golliwog viewpoint
                                    can be found at the International Golliwog Collectors Club's website: <a href="http://www.teddybears.com/golliwog/direct.html"> www.teddybears.com/golliwog/direct.html</a>. Many collectors, primarily though not exclusively whites, contend that the anti-Golliwog
                                    movement represents political correctness at its worst. They argue that the Golliwog
                                    is just a doll, and that the original Florence Upton creation was not racist, intentionally
                                    or unintentionally -- this is reminiscent of the claims about Helen Bannerman's <em>Little Black Sambo</em> (Read the <a href="../picaninny/index.html">Picaninny Caricature</a> essay on this website for a more in-depth discussion of <em>Little Black Sambo</em>).
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Critics of the Golliwog have launched a new attack. They are trying to get the image
                                    removed from all newly published children's books, and they are trying to force businesses
                                    to not use the Golliwog as a trademark. The black Trinidadian writer, Darcus Howe,
                                    said, "English [white] people never give up. Golliwogs have gone and should stay gone.
                                    They appeal to White English sentiment and will do so until the end of time." Gerry
                                    German, of the Working Group Against Racism in Children's Resources, was quoted in
                                    <em>The Voice</em>, a black newspaper, as saying: "I find it appalling that any organization in this
                                    day and age can produce anything which would commemorate the golliwog. It is an offensive
                                    caricature of Black people" (Clark, 1999).
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The Golliwog was created during a racist era. He was drawn as a caricature of a minstrel
                                    -- which itself represented a demeaning image of blacks. There is racial stereotyping
                                    of black people in Florence Upton's books, including <em>The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls</em> -- such as the black minstrel playing a banjo on page 45. It appears that the Golliwog
                                    was another expression of Upton's racial insensitivity. Certainly later Golliwogs
                                    often reflected negative beliefs about blacks -- thieves, miscreants, incompetents.
                                    There is little doubt that the words associated with Golliwog -- Golly, Golli, Wog,
                                    and Golliwog, itself -- are often used as racial slurs. Finally, the resurgence of
                                    interest in the Golliwog is not found primarily among children, but instead is found
                                    among adults, some nostalgic, others with financial interests.<br /><br /><br /> © <span style="font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span>Dr. David Pilgrim, Professor of Sociology<br /> Ferris State University<br /> Nov., 2000<br /> Edited 2012<br /></span></span></p>

                                    Oriental Gentleman, or Working On Government Service. The numerous variations and
                                    a lack of supporting evidence suggest that wog was not an acronym. See Wilton (2007).

                                    It is sometimes employed with a smug, patronizing tone of voice, rather than the snarl
                                    which usually accompanies the use of <em>nigger, spic</em>, and other racial ethnophaulisms. <em>Wog</em> is both an ethnic slur and a racial epithet.
