                                      height="207" /> There is a direct and strong link between the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> and anti-black caricatures. Although <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> has been used to refer to any person of known African ancestry.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>2</span></span></sup> it is usually directed against blacks who supposedly have certain negative characteristics.
                                 The Coon caricature, for example, portrays black men as lazy, ignorant, and obsessively
                                 self-indulgent; these are also traits historically represented by the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span>. The Brute caricature depicts black men as angry, physically strong, animalistic,
                                 and prone to wanton violence. This depiction is also implied in the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span>. The Tom and Mammy caricatures are often portrayed as kind, loving "friends" of whites.
                                 They are also presented as intellectually childlike, physically unattractive, and
                                 neglectful of their biological families. These latter traits have been associated
                                 with blacks, generally, and are implied in the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span>. The word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> was a shorthand way of saying that blacks possessed the moral, intellectual, social,
                                 and physical characteristics of the Coon, Brute, Tom, Mammy, and other racial caricatures.
                                 
                                 <p>The etymology of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> is often traced to the Latin <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niger,</span> meaning black. The Latin <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niger</span> became the noun <span style="text-decoration: underline;">negro</span> (black person) in English, and simply the color black in Spanish and Portuguese.
                                    In Early Modern French <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niger</span> became <span style="text-decoration: underline;">negre</span> and, later, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">negress</span> (black woman) was clearly a part of lexical history. One can compare to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">negre</span> the derogatory <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> – and earlier English variants such as <strong>negar, neegar, neger,</strong> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niggor</span> – which developed into a parallel lexico-semantic reality in English. It is likely
                                    that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> is a phonetic spelling of the white Southern mispronunciation of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Negro.</span> Whatever its origins, by the early 1800s it was firmly established as a denigrative
                                    epithet. Almost two centuries later, it remains a chief symbol of white racism.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Social scientists refer to words like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger, kike, spic,</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wetback</span> as ethnophaulisms. Such terms are the language of prejudice – verbal pictures of
                                    negative stereotypes. Howard J. Ehrlich, a social scientist, argued that ethnophaulisms
                                    are of three types: disparaging nicknames (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">chink, dago, nigger,</span> and so forth); explicit group devaluations ("Jew him down," or "niggering the land");
                                    and irrelevant ethnic names used as a mild disparagement ("jewbird" for cuckoos having
                                    prominent beaks or "Irish confetti" for bricks thrown in a fight)(Ehrlich, 1973, p.
                                    22; Schaefer, 2000, p. 44). All racial and ethnic groups have been victimized by racial
                                    slurs; however, no American group has suffered as many racial epithets as have blacks:
                                    coon, tom, savage, picanniny, mammy, buck, sambo, jigaboo, and buckwheat are typical.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>3</span></span></sup> Many of these slurs became fully developed pseudo-scientific, literary, cinematic,
                                    and everyday caricatures of African Americans. These caricatures, whether spoken,
                                    written, or reproduced in material objects, reflect the extent, the vast network,
                                    of anti-black prejudice.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> carries with it much of the hatred and repulsion directed toward Africans and African
                                    Americans. Historically, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> defined, limited, and mocked African Americans. It was a term of exclusion, a verbal
                                    justification for discrimination. Whether used as a noun, verb, or adjective, it reinforced
                                    the stereotype of the lazy, stupid, dirty, worthless parasite. No other American ethnophaulism
                                    carried so much purposeful venom, as the following representative list suggests:

                                 <p>Americans created a racial hierarchy with whites at the top and blacks at the bottom.
                                    The hierarchy was undergirded by an ideology which justified the use of deceit, manipulation,
                                    and coercion to keep blacks "in their place." Every major societal institution offered
                                    legitimacy to the racial hierarchy. Ministers preached that God had condemned blacks
                                    to be servants. Scientists measured black heads, brains, faces, and genitalia, seeking
                                    to prove that whites were genetically superior to blacks. White teachers, teaching
                                    only white students, taught that blacks were less evolved cognitively, psychologically,
                                    and socially. The entertainment media, from vaudeville to television, portrayed blacks
                                    as docile servants, happy-go-lucky idiots, and dangerous thugs. The criminal justice
                                    system sanctioned a double standard of justice, including its tacit approval of mob
                                    violence against blacks.

                                    by anti-black images. The negative portrayals of blacks were both reflected in and
                                    shaped by everyday material objects: toys, postcards, ashtrays, detergent boxes, fishing
                                    lures, children's books. These items, and countless others, portrayed blacks with
                                    bulging, darting eyes, fire-red and oversized lips, jet black skin, and either naked
                                    or poorly clothed. The majority of these objects did not use the word nigger; however,
                                    many did. In 1874, the McLoughlin Brothers of New York manufactured a puzzle game
                                    called "Chopped Up Niggers." Beginning in 1878, the B. Leidersdory Company of Milwaukee,
                                    Wisconsin, produced NiggerHair Smoking Tobacco - several decades later the name was
                                    changed to BiggerHair Smoking Tobacco. In 1917, the American Tobacco Company had a
                                    NiggerHair redemption promotion. NiggerHair coupons were redeemable for "cash, tobacco,
                                    S. &amp; H. Green stamps, or presents."

                                    into the 1980s. It was not rare for sheet music produced in the first half of the
                                    20th century to use the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> on the cover. The Howley, Haviland Company of New York, produced sheet music for
                                    the songs "Hesitate Mr. Nigger, Hesitate," and "You'se Just A Little Nigger, Still
                                    You'se Mine, All Mine." The latter was billed as a children's lullaby.

So-called
                                    "Jolly Nigger Banks," first made in the 1800s, were widely distributed as late as
                                    the 1960s. Another common item - with many variants, produced on posters, postcards,
                                    and prints - is a picture of a dozen black children rushing for a swimming hole. The
                                    captions read, "Last One In's A Nigger."

                                 <p>The racial hierarchy, which began during slavery and extended into the Jim Crow period,
                                    has been severely eroded by a civil rights movement, landmark Supreme Court decisions,
                                    a black empowerment movement, comprehensive civil rights legislation, and a general
                                    embracing of democratic principles by many American citizens. Yet, the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> has not died. The relationship between the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> and anti-black prejudice is symbiotic: that is, they are interrelated and interconnected,
                                    yet, ironically, not automatically interdependent. In other words, a racist society
                                    created <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> and continues to feed and sustain it; however, the word no longer needs racism, at
                                    least brutal and obvious forms, to exist. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nigger</span> now has a life of its own.

                                         height="167" /> One of the most interesting and perplexing phenomena in American speech is the use
                                    of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> by African Americans. When used by blacks, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> refers to the following: all blacks ("A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> can't even get a break."); black men ("Sisters want <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niggers</span> to work all day long."); blacks who behave in a stereotypical, and sometimes mythical,
                                    manner ("He's a lazy, good-for-nothing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span>."); things ("This piece-of-shit car is such a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span>."); foes ("I'm sick and tired of those <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niggers</span> bothering me!"); and friends ("Me and my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niggers</span> are tight.").
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>This final usage, as a term of endearment, is especially problematic. "Sup <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Niggah</span>," has become an almost universal greeting among young urban blacks. When pressed,
                                    blacks who use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> or its variants claim the following: it has to be understood contextually; continual
                                    use of the word by blacks will make it less offensive; it is not really the same word
                                    because whites are saying <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> (and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niggers</span>) but blacks are saying <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigh</span> (and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niggaz</span>); and, it is just a word and blacks should not be prisoners of the past or the ugly
                                    words which originated in the past. These arguments are not convincing. Brother (Brotha)
                                    and Sister (Sistha or Sista) are terms of endearment. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nigger</span> was and remains a term of derision. Moreover, the false dichotomy between blacks
                                    or African Americans (respectable and middle-class) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niggers</span> (disrespectable and lower class) should be opposed. No blacks are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niggers</span>, irrespective of behavior, income, ambition, clothing, ability, morals, or skin color.
                                    Finally, if continued use of the word lessened its sting then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> would by now have no sting. Blacks, beginning in slavery, have internalized the negative
                                    images that white society cultivated and propagated about black skin and black people.
                                    This is reflected in periods of self- and same-race loathing. The use of the word
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> by blacks reflects this loathing, even when the user is unaware of the psychological
                                    forces at play. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nigger</span> is the ultimate expression of white racism and white superiority no matter how it
                                    is pronounced. It is a linguistic corruption, a corruption of civility. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nigger</span> is the most infamous word in American culture. Some words carry more weight than
                                    others. At the risk of hyperbole, is genocide just another word? Pedophilia? Obviously,
                                    no: neither is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span>.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>After a period of relative dormancy, the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> has been reborn in popular culture. It is hard-edged, streetwise, and it has crossed
                                    over into movies like Pulp Fiction (Bender &amp; Tarantino, 1994) and Jackie Brown (Bender
                                    &amp; Tarantino, 1997), where it became a symbol of "street authenticity" and hipness.
                                    Denzel Washington's character in Training Day (Newmyer, Silver &amp; Fuqua, 2001) uses
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> frequently and harshly.

                                         height="216" /> Richard Pryor long ago disavowed the use of the word in his comedy act, but Chris
                                    Rock and Chris Tucker, the new black male comedy kings, use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> regularly - and not affectionately. Justin Driver (2001), a social critic, argued
                                    persuasively that both Rock and Tucker are modern minstrels - shucking, jiving, and
                                    grinning, in the tradition of Stepin Fetchit.

                                 <p>Poetry by African Americans is also instructive, as one finds <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> used in black poetry over and over again. Major and minor poets alike have used it,
                                    often with startling results: Imamu Amiri Baraka, one of the most gifted of our contemporary
                                    poets, uses <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> in one of his angriest poems, "I Don't Love You."
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;">. . .and what was the world to the words of slick nigger fathers too depressed to
                                    explain why they could not appear to be men. (1969, p. 55)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>One wonders: how are readers supposed to understand "nigger fathers"? Baraka's use
                                    of this imagery, regardless of his intention, reinforces the stereotype of the worthless,
                                    hedonistic Coon caricature. Ted Joans's use of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> in "The Nice Colored Man" makes Baraka's comparatively harmless and innocent. Joans
                                    tells the story about how he came to write this unusual piece. He was, he says, asked
                                    to give a reading in London because he was a "nice colored man." Infuriated by the
                                    labels "nice" and "colored", Joans set down the quintessential truculent poem. While
                                    the poem should be read in its entirety, a few lines will suffice:
                                 </p>

                                 <p>This is the poem, with adjective upon adjective attached to the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span>. The shocking reality is that many of these uses can be heard in contemporary American
                                    society. Herein lies part of the problem: the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> persists because it is used over and over again, even by the people it defames. Devorah
                                    Major, a poet and novelist, said, "It's hard for me to say what someone can or can't
                                    say, because I work with language all the time, and I don't want to be limited." Opal
                                    Palmer Adisa, a poet and professor, claims that the use of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigga</span> is "the same as young people's obsession with cursing. A lot of their use of such
                                    language is an internalization of negativity about themselves" (Allen-Taylor, 1998).

                                    message of hate. An Internet search of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> locates many anti-black web pages: Niggers Must Die, Hang A Nigger For America, Nigger
                                    Joke Central, and literally thousands of others. Visitors to these sites know, like
                                    most blacks know experientially, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> is an expression of anti-black antipathy.

                                 <p>No American minority group has been caricatured as often, in as many ways, as have
                                    blacks. These caricatures combined distorted physical descriptions and negative cultural
                                    and behavior stereotypes. The Coon caricature, for example, was a tall, skinny, loose-jointed,
                                    dark-skinned male, often bald, with oversized, ruby-red lips. His clothing was either
                                    ragged and dirty or outlandishly gaudy. His slow, exaggerated gait suggested laziness.
                                    He was a pauper, lacking ambition and the skills necessary for upward social mobility.
                                    He was a buffoon. When frightened, the Coon's eyes bulged and darted. His speech was
                                    slurred, halted, and replete with malapropisms. His shrill, high-pitched voice made
                                    whites laugh. The Coon caricature dehumanized blacks, and served as a justification
                                    for social, economic, and political discrimination.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nigger</span> may be viewed as an umbrella term - a way of saying that blacks have the negative
                                    characteristics of the Coon, Buck, Tom, Mammy, Sambo, Picaninny, and other anti-black
                                    caricatures. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nigger</span>, like the caricatures it encompasses and implies, belittles blacks, and rationalizes
                                    their mistreatment. The use of the word or its variants by blacks has not significantly
                                    lessened its sting. This is not surprising. The historical relationship between European
                                    Americans and African Americans was shaped by a racial hierarchy which spanned three
                                    centuries. Anti-black attitudes, values, and behavior were normative. Historically,
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nigger</span> more than any word captured the personal antipathy and institutionalized racism directed
