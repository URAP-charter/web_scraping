                                 and criminal -- deserving punishment, maybe death. This brute is a fiend, a sociopath,
                                 an anti-social menace. Black brutes are depicted as hideous, terrifying predators
                                 who target helpless victims, especially white women. Charles H. Smith (1893), writing
                                 in the 1890s, claimed, "A bad negro is the most horrible creature upon the earth,
                                 the most brutal and merciless"(p. 181). Clifton R. Breckinridge (1900), a contemporary
                                 of Smith's, said of the black race, "when it produces a brute, he is the worst and
                                 most insatiate brute that exists in human form" (p. 174). George T. Winston (1901),
                                 another "Negrophobic" writer, claimed:
                                 
                                 <p><span style="font-family: Courier New;">When a knock is heard at the door [a White woman] shudders with nameless horror. The
                                       black brute is lurking in the dark, a monstrous beast, crazed with lust. His ferocity
                                       is almost demoniacal. A mad bull or tiger could scarcely be more brutal. A whole community
                                       is frenzied with horror, with the blind and furious rage for vengeance.(pp. 108-109)</span></p>
                                 During slavery the dominant caricatures of blacks -- Mammy, Coon, Tom, and picaninny
                                 -- portrayed them as childlike, ignorant, docile, groveling, and generally harmless.
                                 These portrayals were pragmatic and instrumental. Proponents of slavery created and
                                 promoted images of blacks that justified slavery and soothed white consciences. If
                                 slaves were childlike, for example, then a paternalistic institution where masters
                                 acted as quasi-parents to their slaves was humane, even morally right. More importantly,
                                 slaves were rarely depicted as brutes because that portrayal might have become a self-fulfilling
                                 prophecy.
                                 
                                 <p>During the Radical Reconstruction period (1867-1877), many white writers argued that
                                    without slavery -- which supposedly suppressed their animalistic tendencies -- blacks
                                    were reverting to criminal savagery. The belief that the newly-emancipated blacks
                                    were a "black peril" continued into the early 1900s. Writers like the novelist Thomas
                                    Nelson Page (1904) lamented that the slavery-era "good old darkies" had been replaced
                                    by the "new issue" (blacks born after slavery) whom he described as "lazy, thriftless,
                                    intemperate, insolent, dishonest, and without the most rudimentary elements of morality"
                                    (pp. 80, 163). Page, who helped popularize the images of cheerful and devoted Mammies
                                    and Sambos in his early books, became one of the first writers to introduce a literary
                                    black brute. In 1898 he published <em>Red Rock</em>, a Reconstruction novel, with the heinous figure of Moses, a loathsome and sinister
                                    black politician. Moses tried to rape a white woman: "He gave a snarl of rage and
                                    sprang at her like a wild beast" (pp. 356-358). He was later lynched for "a terrible
                                    crime."

                                 <p>The "terrible crime" most often mentioned in connection with the black brute was rape,
                                    specifically the rape of a white woman. At the beginning of the twentieth century,
                                    much of the virulent, anti-black propaganda that found its way into scientific journals,
                                    local newspapers, and best-selling novels focused on the stereotype of the black rapist.
                                    The claim that black brutes were, in epidemic numbers, raping white women became the
                                    public rationalization for the lynching of blacks.

                                 <p>The lynching of blacks was relatively common between Reconstruction and World War
                                    II. According to Tuskegee Institute data, from 1882 to 1951 4,730 people were lynched
                                    in the United States: 3,437 black and 1,293 white (Gibson, n.d.). Many of the white
                                    lynching victims were foreigners or belonged to oppressed groups, for example, Mormons,
                                    Shakers, and Catholics. By the early 1900s lynching had a decidedly racial character:
                                    white mobs lynched blacks. Almost 90 percent of the lynchings of blacks occurred in
                                    southern or border states.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Many of these victims were ritualistically tortured. In 1904, Luther Holbert and his
                                    wife were burned to death. They were "tied to trees and while the funeral pyres were
                                    being prepared, they were forced to hold out their hands while one finger at a time
                                    was chopped off. The fingers were distributed as souvenirs. The ears...were cut off.
                                    Holbert was beaten severely, his skull fractured and one of his eyes, knocked out
                                    with a stick, hung by a shred from the socket." Members of the mob then speared the
                                    victims with a large corkscrew, "the spirals tearing out big pieces of...flesh every
                                    time it was withdrawn" (Holden-Smith, 1996, p. 1).

                                    victim be seen as equally brutal and savage; as these lynchings became more common
                                    and more brutal, so did the assassination of the black character. In 1900, Charles
                                    Carroll's <em>The Negro A Beast</em> claimed that blacks were more akin to apes than to human beings, and theorized that
                                    blacks had been the "tempters of Eve." Carroll said that mulatto<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"> <span>1</span></span></sup> brutes were the rapists and murderers of his time (pp. 167, 191, 290-202). Dr. William
                                    Howard, writing in the respectable journal <em>Medicine</em> in 1903, claimed that "the attacks on defenseless White women are evidence of racial
                                    instincts" (in blacks), and the black birthright was "sexual madness and excess" (Fredrickson,
                                    1971, p. 279). Thomas Dixon's <em>The Leopard's Spots</em>, a 1902 novel, claimed that emancipation had transformed blacks from "a chattel to
                                    be bought and sold into a beast to be feared and guarded" (Fredrickson, p. 280).

                                    blacks as "half child, half animal, the sport of impulse, whim, and conceit...a being
                                    who, left to his will, roams at night and sleeps in the day, whose speech knows no
                                    word of love, whose passions, once aroused, are as the fury of the tiger" (Fredrickson,
                                    1971, pp. 280-281). The Clansman includes a detailed and gory account of the rape
                                    of a young white virgin by a black brute. "A single tiger springs, and the black claws
                                    of the beast sank into the soft white throat." After the rape, the girl and her mother
                                    both commit suicide, and the black brute is lynched by the Ku Klux Klan. This book
                                    served as the basis for the movie The Birth of a Nation (Griffith, 1915), which also
                                    portrayed some blacks as rapist-beasts, justified the lynching of blacks, and glorified
                                    the Ku Klux Klan. Carroll, Howard, and Dixon did not exceed the prevailing racism
                                    of the so-called Progressive Era.

                                 <p>In 1921-22 the United States House of Representatives and Senate debated the Dyer
                                    Bill, an anti-lynching bill. This bill provided fines and imprisonment for persons
                                    convicted of lynching in federal courts, and fines and penalties against states, counties,
                                    and cities which failed to use reasonable effort to protect citizens from lynch mobs.
                                    The Dyer Bill passed in the House of Representatives, but it was killed in the Senate
                                    by filibustering southerners who claimed that it was unconstitutional and an infringement
                                    upon states' rights (Gibson, n.d., p. 5). The following statements made by southern
                                    Congressmen during the Dyer Bill debate suggest that they were more concerned with
                                    white supremacy and the oppression of blacks than they were with constitutional issues.

                                    equality which excites the criminal sensualities of the criminal element of the Negro
                                    race and directly incites the diabolical crime of rape upon the white women. Lynching
                                    follows as swift as lightning, and all the statutes of State and Nation cannot stop

                                       of the woman who has been outraged? The colored people of [the South] realize the
                                       manner of that enforcement, and that is the one method by which the horrible crime
                                       of rape has been held down where the Negro element is in a large majority. The man
                                       who believes that the Negro race is all bad is mistaken. But you must recollect that

                                    not been accused of rape or attempted rape. According to the Tuskegee Institute's
                                    lynching data, the accusations against lynching victims for the years 1882 to 1951
                                    were: 41 percent for felonious assault, 19.2 percent for rape, 6.1 percent for attempted
                                    rape, 4.9 percent for robbery and theft, 1.8 percent for insulting white people, and
                                    27 percent for miscellaneous offenses (for example, trying to vote, testifying against
                                    a white man, asking a white woman to marry) or no offenses at all (Gibson, n.d., p.
                                    3). The 25.3% who were accused of rape or attempted rape were often not guilty, and
                                    were killed without benefit of trial. Gunnar Myrdal (1944), a Swedish social scientist
                                    who studied American race relations, stated:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;">There is much reason to believe that this figure [25.3 percent] has been inflated
                                    by the fact that a mob which makes the accusation of rape is secure from any further
                                    investigation; by the broad Southern definition of rape to include all sexual relations
                                    between Negro men and white women; and by the psychopathic fears of white women in
                                    their contacts with Negro men. (pp. 561-562)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>Lynchings often involved castration, amputation of hands and feet, spearing with long
                                    nails and sharpened steel rods, removal of eyes, beating with blunt instruments, shooting
                                    with bullets, burning at the stake, and hanging. It was, when done by southern mobs,
                                    especially sadistic, irrespective of the criminal charge. Most white southerners agreed
                                    that lynching was evil, but they claimed that black brutes were a greater evil.

                                 <p>Lynchings were necessary, argued many whites, to preserve the racial purity of the
                                    white race, more specifically, the racial purity of white women. White men had sexual
                                    relations -- consensual and rape -- with black women as soon as Africans were introduced
                                    into the European American colonies. These sexual unions produced numerous mixed-race
                                    offspring. White women, as "keepers of white racial purity," were not allowed consensual
                                    sexual relations with black men. A black man risked his life by having sexual relations
                                    with a white woman. Even talking to a white woman in a "familiar" manner could result
                                    in black males being killed.

                                    in Mississippi. The exact details are not known, but Till apparently referred to a
                                    female white store clerk as "Baby." Several days later, the woman's husband and brother
                                    took Till from his uncle's home, beat him to death -- his head was crushed and one
                                    eye was gouged out--and threw his body into the Tallahatchie River. The men were caught,
                                    tried, and found innocent by an all-white jury. The case became a <em>cause celebre</em> during the civil rights movement, showing the nation that brutal violence undergirded
                                    Jim Crow laws and etiquette.

                                 <p>There were black rapists with white victims, but they were relatively rare; most white
                                    rape victims were raped by white men. The brute caricature was a red herring, a myth
                                    used to justify lynching, which in turn was used as a social control mechanism to
                                    instill fear in black communities. Each lynching sent messages to blacks: Do not register
                                    to vote. Do not apply for a white man's job. Do not complain publicly. Do not organize.
                                    Do not talk to white women. The brute caricature gained in popularity whenever blacks
                                    pushed for social equality. According to Allen D. Grimshaw (1969), a sociologist,
                                    the most savage oppression of blacks by whites, whether expressed in rural lynchings
                                    or urban race riots, has taken place when blacks have refused or been perceived by
                                    whites as refusing to accept a subordinate or oppressed status (pp. 264-265).

                                    their images of and beliefs about blacks. Television and newspaper coverage showing
                                    black protesters, including children, being beaten, arrested, and jailed by baton-waving
                                    police officers led many whites to see blacks as victims, not victimizers. The brute
                                    caricature did not die, but it lost much of its credibility. Not surprisingly, lynchings,
                                    especially public well-attended ones, decreased in number. Lynchings became "hate
                                    crimes," committed secretly. Beginning in the 1960s the relatively few blacks who
                                    were lynched were not accused of sexual assaults; instead, these lynchings were reactions
                                    of white supremacists to black economic and social progress.

                                 <p>The brute caricature has not been as common as the Coon caricature in American movies.
                                    <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> (Griffiths, 1915) was the first major American movie to portray all the major anti-black
                                    caricatures, including the brute. That movie led to numerous black protests and white-initiated
                                    race riots. One result of the racial strife was that black male actors in the 1920s
                                    through 1940s found themselves limited to Coon and Tom roles. It was neither socially
                                    acceptable nor economically profitable to show movies where black brutes terrorized
                                    whites.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>In the 1960s and 1970s "Blaxploitation" movies brought aggressive, anti-white black
                                    males onto the big screen. Some of these fit the "Buck" caricature -- for example,
                                    the private detective in <em>Shaft</em> (Freeman &amp; Parks, 1971) and the pimp in <em>Superfly</em> (Shore &amp; Parks, 1972) -- but some of the Blaxploitation actors were cinematic brutes,
                                    for example Melvin Van Peebles' character in <em>Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</em> (Gross, Van Peebles &amp; Van Peebles, 1971). Sweetback, the main character, is falsely
                                    accused of a crime. On the lam he assaults several men, rapes a black woman, and kills
                                    corrupt police officers. The movie ends with the message: A BAADASSSSS NIGGER IS COMING
                                    BACK TO COLLECT SOME DUES. That frightened whites. Young blacks, tired of the Stepin
                                    Fetchit portrayals, flocked to see the low-budget movie. Although dressed in the clothes
                                    of a rebel, Sweetback was as much a brute as had been the lustful Gus in <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>.

                                    one of the many black sadistic pimps who have abused and degraded whites in American
                                    movies. Mister---, the husband in <em>The Color Purple</em> (Jones, Kennedy, Marshall, Spielberg &amp; Spielberg, 1985), is an angry and savage wife
                                    abuser, and so is Ike Turner in <em>What's Love Got To Do With It?</em> (Chapin, Krost &amp; Gibson, 1993). Both are brutes whose victims happen to be black.
                                    Turner's real life criminal behavior (which predated the movie) was used to give credibility
                                    to his character's portrayal as a brute and, more importantly, to reinforce the belief
                                    that blacks are especially prone to brutish behavior.

                                 <p>In the 1980s and 1990s the typical cinema and television brute was nameless and sometimes
                                    faceless; he sprang from a hiding place, he robbed, raped, and murdered. He represented
                                    the cold brutality of urban life. Often he was a gangbanger. Sometimes he was a dope
                                    fiend. Actors who played the black brute were usually not on screen very long, just
                                    long enough to terrorize innocent victims. They were movie props. On television shows
                                    like <em>Law and Order, Homicide: Life on the Streets, ER,</em> and <em>NYPD Blue</em>, nameless black brutes assault, maim, and kill. On October 2, 2000, NBC debuted <em>Deadline</em>, a drama involving an irascible journalism teacher. In the first episode two young
                                    black males brutally kill five restaurant workers. They kill without remorse.

                                 <p>The recent depiction of black males as brutes is not limited to television dramas.
                                    Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight boxing champion, has embraced the brute image.
                                    Tyson was marketed as a sadistic and savage warrior who was capable of killing an
                                    opponent. His quick knockouts bolstered his reputation as the world's most feared
                                    man. Joyce Carol Oates wrote, "Tyson suggests a savagery only symbolically contained
                                    within the brightly illuminated ring" (Souther, n.d.). She wrote this a decade before
                                    Tyson was convicted of several criminal charges, including the rape of a beauty pageant
                                    contestant, and later, the battering of two motorists. After his boxing skills had
                                    diminished, Tyson gained greater notoriety by biting the ear of an opponent during
                                    a bout. In a news conference Tyson said, "I am an animal. I am a convicted rapist,
                                    a hell-raiser, a loving father, a semi-good husband." Referring to Lennox Lewis, the
                                    heavyweight boxing champion, Tyson said, "If he ever tries to intimidate me, I'm gonna
                                    put a fu--ing bullet through his fu--ing skull" (Serjeant, 2000). Tyson benefited
                                    from the brute image. His boxing matches were "events." Spectators paid thousands
                                    of dollars for ringside seats. Tyson became the wealthiest and best known athlete
                                    on earth. In his mind, he was a twenty-first century gladiator; to the American public,
                                    he was simply a black brute.

                                    brute. He has donated thousands of dollars to civic, educational, and humanitarian
                                    organizations. Without media fanfare, he has visited hundreds of hospitalized patients,
                                    especially seriously ill and injured children. He is smarter than his public image,
                                    and has worked diligently to "deepen" his intellect. Yet, he was marketed, with his
                                    permission, as a crude savage. Americans see him as an affirmation of the black brute
                                    caricature, and he has, especially in recent years, embraced the stereotype outside
                                    the boxing ring. Tyson can no longer distinguish the (Iron Mike) myth from the (vicious
                                    criminal) madness, and many white Americans cannot separate Tyson's criminal behavior
                                    from his blackness.

                                 <p>During the 1988 presidential campaign, George Bush's election committee sought to
                                    portray his opponent, Michael Dukakis, as weak on crime. Bush's team used television
                                    advertisements which showed a menacing mug shot of Willie Horton, a black convicted
                                    murderer. Horton, while out of prison on an unguarded 48-hour furlough, kidnapped
                                    a young white suburban couple. He repeatedly stabbed the man and raped the woman several
                                    times. The image of Horton's threatening face on the nation's television screens helped
                                    Bush win the election. It also reinforced the belief that a black brute is worse than
                                    a white brute.

                                    the church where Smith's family attended services, said in reference to the black
                                    suspect, "There are some people that would like to see this man's brains bashed in"
                                    (Squires, 1994).

                                 <p>After nine days of a gut-wrenching search and strained relations between local blacks
                                    and whites, there was finally a break in the case: Susan Smith confessed to drowning
                                    her own sons. In a two-page handwritten confession she apologized to her sons, but
                                    she did not apologize to blacks, nationally or locally. "It was hard to be black this
                                    week in Union," said Hester Booker, a local black man. "The whites acted so different.
                                    They wouldn't speak (to blacks); they'd look at you and then reach over and lock their
                                    doors. And all because that lady lied" (Fields, 1994).

                                 <p>The false allegations of Charles Stuart and Susan Smith could have led to racial violence.
                                    In 1908, in Springfield, Illinois, Mabel Hallam, a white woman, falsely accused "a
                                    black fiend," George Richardson, of raping her. Her accusations angered local whites.
                                    They formed a mob, killed two blacks chosen randomly, then burned and pillaged the
                                    local black community. Blacks fled to avoid a mass lynching. Hallam later admitted
                                    that she lied about the rape to cover up an extramarital affair.

                                 <p>How many lynchings and race riots have resulted from false accusations of rape and
                                    murder leveled against so-called black brutes?
