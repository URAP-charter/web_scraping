                                      height="210" /> The Tom caricature portrays black men as faithful, happily submissive servants. The
                                 Tom caricature, like the Mammy caricature, was born in ante-bellum America in the
                                 defense of slavery. How could slavery be wrong, argued its proponents, if black servants,
                                 males (Toms) and females (Mammies), were contented and loyal? The Tom is presented
                                 as a smiling, wide-eyed, dark skinned server: fieldworker, cook, butler, porter, or
                                 waiter. Unlike the Coon, the Tom is portrayed as a dependable worker, eager to serve.
                                 Unlike the Brute, the Tom is docile and non-threatening to whites. The Tom is often
                                 old, physically weak, psychologically dependent on whites for approval. In his book,
                                 <em>Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, &amp; Bucks</em>, Donald Bogle (1994) summarizes the depiction of Toms in movies:<span style="font-family: Courier New;"> Always as toms are chased, harassed, hounded, flogged, enslaved, and insulted, they
                                    keep the faith, n'er turn against their white massas, and remain hearty, submissive,
                                    stoic, generous, selfless, and oh-so-very kind. Thus they endear themselves to white
                                    audiences and emerge as heroes of sorts. (pp. 5-6)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>Bogle's description is similar to the portrayal of the main black character in Harriet
                                    Beecher Stowe's antislavery novel <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>. Stowe's Tom is a gentle, humble, Christian slave. His faith is simple, natural,
                                    and complete. Stowe uses Tom's character to show the perfect gentleness and forgiving
                                    nature which she believed lay dormant in all blacks. These qualities reveal themselves
                                    under favorable conditions. Mr. Shelby, Tom's first Master is kind; therefore, Tom's
                                    innate spirituality flourishes. Mr. Shelby is not a good businessman; his financial
                                    troubles necessitate that he sell Tom. Tom does not run away despite a warning that
                                    he is to be sold. Mr. St. Clare, his second master, befriends Tom and promises to
                                    free him. Unfortunately for Tom, Mr. St. Clare is killed before signing manumission
                                    papers. Tom's fortunes take a decidedly sad turn. Tom is sold to Simon Legree, a brutal
                                    and sadistic deep South plantation owner. Legree is also a drunkard who hates religion
                                    and religious people.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Legree intends to make Tom an overseer. Tom is ordered by Legree to flog a woman slave.
                                    Tom refuses. Legree strikes him repeatedly with a cowhide lash. Again, he tells Tom
                                    to beat the woman. Tom, with a soft voice, says, "the poor crittur's sick and feeble;
                                    'twould be downright cruel, and it's what I never would do, nor begin to. Mas'r, if
                                    you mean to kill me, kill me; but, as to my raising my hand agin anyone here, I never
                                    shall, -- I'll die first" (Stowe, p. 439).
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Stowe wanted to show how slavery was incongruent with Christianity. How could Christians,
                                    she wondered, buy, sell, and trade slaves? How could they offer even tacit approval
                                    of slavery? How could white Christians allow their enslaved brethren to be sold to
                                    the likes of Legree? Her book is an unabashed attack on slavery, and Tom is one of
                                    her two perfect Christian characters; Mr. St. Clare's daughter, Eva, the other. Both
                                    die, Tom as a martyr.

                                 <p>Legree demands information from Tom about two women runaways. He knows that Tom can
                                    help him. Tom refuses. Legree beats Tom and threatens to kill him if Tom does not
                                    help him find the women. Tom, ever the Christian, does not lie, nor does he give Legree
                                    the information. Instead, Tom says:

                                 <p>Legree beats Tom; Sambo, one of Legree's black overseers, flogs Tom. As Tom is dying,
                                    Legree yells to Sambo, "Give it to him!" Tom opens his eyes, looks at Legree, and
                                    says, "Ye poor miserable crittur! There ain't no more that ye can do! I forgive ye,
                                    with all my soul" (p. 509). Soon afterwards, Tom dies. Stowe portrayed him as a Christ
                                    figure; albeit a childlike one. Tom was offered as a sacrifice for the sins of an
                                    evil institution.

                                    -- Tom is sold, cursed, slapped, kicked, flogged, worked like a horse, then beaten
                                    to death. He never lifts a hand to hit his masters nor to stop a blow. Tom does not
                                    complain, rebel, or run away. This partially explains why the names "Uncle Tom" and
                                    "Tom" have become terms of disgust for African Americans. Tom's devotion to his master
                                    is surpassed only by his devotion to his religious faith.

                                 <p><em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> sold over two million copies within two years of its publication in 1853. In the
                                    first three years after its publication, fourteen proslavery novels were written to
                                    contradict the book's antislavery messages. A more subtle undermining of Stowe's portrayal
                                    of slavery occurred on entertainment stages. By 1879 there were at least forty-nine
                                    traveling companies performing <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> throughout the United States (Turner, 1994, p. 78). The stage versions, often called
                                    Tom Shows, differed from Stowe's book in significant ways. Little Eva was now the
                                    star; all other characters were relegated to the periphery. The violence inherent
                                    in slavery was understated. In some instances the brutality was ignored completely.
                                    Slaves were depicted as "happy darkies" living under a benevolent, paternalistic system.
                                    Legree was mean but not a brute, and in some Tom shows he was portrayed as doing Tom
                                    a favor by killing him -- since Tom could not enter heaven unless he died.

                                    Tom. Stowe's Tom was an obedient, loyal, non-complaining slave, but he was not weak
                                    or docile. Tom resisted Legree. He gave his life rather than help Legree find the
                                    two women runaways. Stowe painted a slave with dignity -- a slave who dared to pity
                                    his master. Throughout the novel, Tom is venerable and kind. His theology, though
                                    simple, is fully developed and consistent. He is a man of principle. Patricia Turner,
                                    author of <em>Ceramic Uncles &amp; Celluloid Mammies</em> (1994), wrote:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> Further marked inconsistencies are discernible between the values and principles
                                    of the reconstructed Uncle Tom and Stowe's original hero. Both are devout, stalwart
                                    Christians. Both are unflinching in their loyalty. But the reconstructed Uncle Toms
                                    are passive, docile, unthinking Christians. Loyal and faithful to white employers,
                                    they are duplicitous in their dealings with fellow blacks. Stowe's Tom is a proactive
                                    Christian warrior. He does more than accept God's will, he endeavors to fulfill it
                                    in all of his words and deeds. He is loyal to each of his white masters, even the
                                    cruel Simon Legree. Yet his allegiance to his fellow slaves is equally strong. (p.

                                 <p>The versions of Uncle Tom that entertained audiences on stages were drained of these
                                    noble traits. He was an unthinking religious slave, sometimes happy, often fearful.
                                    Significantly, the stage Toms were middle-aged or elderly. He was shown stooped, often
                                    with a cane or stick. He was thin, almost emaciated. His eyesight was failing. These
                                    depictions of Uncle Tom are inconsistent with Stowe's Tom who was a "broad-chested,
                                    strong armed fellow." Stowe's original was the father of small children, unlike the
                                    desexed Toms of the stage. Stowe's Tom was capable of outworking most slaves. Patricia
                                    Turner says of Stowe:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> By depicting his ability to save a child's life and work long days in the field,
                                    she delivers a brave, physically capable hero whose abilities contradict the lazy
                                    slave stereotype then being actively promoted by pro-slavery Southerners. The elderly,
                                    stooped-over, slow-moving Uncle Tom of contemporary popular culture could never have
                                    fulfilled the political ends sought by Stowe. (p. 73)</span>

                                 <p>Portrayals of Uncle Tom in movies also departed from Stowe's original. In 1903, Edwin
                                    S. Porter directed a twelve-minute version of <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>. This was the first black character in an American film; ironically, Uncle Tom was
                                    played by an unnamed white actor colored with blackface makeup. Porter's Uncle Tom,
                                    like the Toms on stage, was a childlike, groveling servant. In the first quarter of
                                    the 20th century there were many cinematic adaptations of <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> which portrayed slavery as a benevolent institution, Little Eva as an earthly angel,
                                    and blacks, especially Tom, as loyal, childlike, unthinking, and happy. In 1914, a
                                    black actor, Sam Lucas, was allowed to play the Uncle Tom role in a film (Ritchey
                                    &amp; Daly). His advanced age -- he was seventy-two -- helped perpetuate the perception
                                    that Uncle Tom was old and physically weak. In 1927 Universal Pictures remade <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> (Pollard) and used the black actor James B. Lowe in the title role. The Toms played
                                    by Lucas and Lowe, like the many Toms played by white actors in blackface makeup,
                                    were genial, passive, happy servants.

                                 <p>Uncle Tom was not the only Tom depicted in early American movies. Indeed, the Tom
                                    character was a staple of the movie screen and, later, television shows. In the silent
                                    short film <em>Confederate Spy</em> (Olcott, 1910), Uncle Daniel, a Tom character, is a southern black spy. He is caught
                                    and brought before a Union firing squad. He has no regrets facing death because he
                                    "did it for massa's sake and for little massa" (Bogle, 1994, p. 6). In <em>For Massa's Sake</em> (Golden, 1911), a former slave is so attached to his former master that he sells
                                    himself back into slavery to help pay the white man's debts (Bogle, p. 6). <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> (Griffith, 1915) and <em>Hearts in Dixie</em> (Sloane, 1929) have numerous anti-black caricatures, including Toms who adore their
                                    masters.

                                    Coons such as Stepin Fetchit, Mantan Moreland, and Willie Best; and Toms, of whom
                                    the most notable were Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Clarence Muse, and Eddie "Rochester"
                                    Anderson. Robinson is best known as child star Shirley Temple's dance partner. They
                                    appeared in four films together, including <em>The Littlest Rebel</em> (DeSylva &amp; Butler, 1935). Robinson plays the role of Uncle Billy, a good-natured,
                                    well-mannered Tom. Temple plays Virginia Houston Cary, the feisty young daughter of
                                    Captain Cary of the Confederate Army. Captain Cary goes off to battle. The Cary plantation
                                    is invaded by Union soldiers. Virginia's mother becomes ill and soon dies. Captain
                                    Cary returns home and is taken prisoner. He is tried for treason. Uncle Billy helps
                                    little Virginia escape. The pair earn their fare to Washington by dancing and "passing
                                    the cap." Miraculously, they gain an audience with President Abraham Lincoln who pardons
                                    Virginia's father. Robinson also portrayed genial, loyal servants in <em>The Little Colonel</em> (DeSylva &amp; Butler, 1935) with Temple and Lionel Barrymore, <em>In Old Kentucky</em> (Butcher &amp; Marshall, 1935) with Will Rogers, and <em>Just Around the Corner</em> (Hempstead &amp; Cummings, 1938) with Temple.

                                 <p>Clarence Muse was a graduate of the Dickinson School of Law in Philadelphia and he
                                    had formal theatrical training; nevertheless, his career is noted for portrayals of
                                    Coons and Toms, especially the latter. He played Tom roles in <em>Show Boat</em> (Laemmle &amp; Whale, 1936), <em>Follow Your Heart</em> (Levine &amp; Scotto, 1936), <em>Zanzibar</em> (Douglas &amp; Schuster, 1940), <em>Heaven Can Wait</em> (Lubitsch, 1943), <em>Joe Palooka in the Knockout</em> (Chester &amp; Le Borg, 1947), and <em>Riding High</em> (Capra, 1950). The Tom role, like most of the early black stereotypes, suggested
                                    that blacks were one-dimensional. Muse's Toms were thoughtful and often articulate
                                    servants. Bogle calls him the "dignified, humanized tom" (1994, p. 54).

                                 <p>Eddie Anderson played the Tom role in <em>Jezebel</em> (Wyler, 1938) and <em>You Can't Cheat an Honest Man</em> (Cowan &amp; Marshall, 1939), but he is best known as Jack Benny's raspy voiced manservant
                                    Rochester. The pair appeared in movies, for example, <em>Love Thy Neighbor</em> (Sandrich, 1940), and <em>The Meanest Man in the World</em> (Perlberg &amp; Lanfield, 1943), radio programs, and a long-running television program.
                                    Their on-screen relationship was characterized by good natured struggles, with Rochester
                                    often besting his "Boss." Rochester was one of the first black characters to "show
                                    up" his white employer; nevertheless, the role still fits into the Tom stereotype,
                                    albeit with elements of shrewdness and rebellion.

                                    film that dealt with slavery included Toms. The still popular <em>Gone With the Wind</em> (Selznick &amp; Fleming, 1939) included the Tom character Pork, a pathetic man, his back
                                    stooped, his speech halted, afraid of whites, yet desiring, above all, to please them.
                                    Pork is a marginal character. In later movies Toms would be even more marginalized,
                                    many lacking names. Coons played the role of comic relief. Toms symbolized wealth.
                                    Producers who wanted to show that a family had "old money" often surrounded the family
                                    with black servants. Toms also suggested a nostalgic social order. Toms represented
                                    the supposed "good ol' days" before the civil rights and black power movements.

                                         height="180" /> Sidney Poitier, the leading black male actor of the 1960s, also played roles that
                                    approximated the Tom stereotype, even though his characters were never one dimensional.
                                    Poitier did not play characters that were submissive, cheerful servants, but many
                                    of his characters were white-identified. In <em>Edge of the City</em> (Susskind &amp; Ritt, 1957) Poitier sacrifices his life, and in <em>The Defiant Ones</em> (Kramer, 1958) Poitier sacrifices his freedom, for white males. Like the black servants
                                    of old, his characters worked to improve the lives of whites. <em>In Lilies of the Field</em> (Nelson, 1963) he helps refugee nuns build a chapel; in <em>The Slender Thread</em> (Alexander &amp; Pollack, 1965) he works to help a suicidal woman; in <em>A Patch of Blue</em> (Berman &amp; Green, 1965) he aids a young blind woman who does not know he is black;
                                    in <em>To Sir With Love</em> (Clavell, 1967) he tries to teach working class youth, almost all white, to value
                                    education. In the last, some of the students racially taunt him; eventually he loses
                                    his composure. Later, he berates himself for having displayed anger. Reluctance to
                                    fight back is reminiscent of earlier Tom portrayals, for example, Bill Robinson's
                                    character in <em>The Little Colonel</em>, who stands patiently and silently as he is insulted by the white master. Bogle (1994)
                                    describes Poitier's roles this way:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> They were mild-mannered toms, throwbacks to the humanized Christian servants of the
                                    1930s. When insulted or badgered, the Poitier character stood by and took it. He knew
                                    the white world meant him no real harm. He differed from the old servants only in
                                    that he was governed by a code of decency, duty, and moral intelligence. There were
                                    times in his films when he screamed out in rage at the injustices of a racist white
                                    society. But reason always dictated his actions, along with love for his fellow man.

                                 <p>Poitier's characters, like earlier Toms, were also denied sex lives. In many of his
                                    roles he has no wife or girlfriend, and, when he did have romantic relationships,
                                    they were drained of sexual tension and fulfillment. In <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em> (Gilbert, Rose, Susskind &amp; Petrie, 1961) there are no romantic scenes with his black
                                    wife. In <em>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</em> (Kramer, 1967) he only kisses his white fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e once, and the audience sees
                                    the kiss through a cabdriver's rear view mirror.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>1</span></span></sup> In <em>A Patch of Blue</em> he kisses the white romantic interest once, then sacrifices any amorous possibilities
                                    by arranging for her to leave for a school for the blind.

                                 <p>Poitier's Toms are best described as "Enlightened Toms." In many of his films he is
                                    the smartest, most articulate character -- and, more importantly, the one who delves
                                    into the philosophical issues: egalitarianism, humanitarianism, and altruism. Moreover,
                                    he acts upon these philosophical musings. He is a paragon of saintly virtue, sacrificing
                                    for others, who, not coincidentally, are often white.

                                 <p>Morgan Freeman's character, Hoke, in <em>Driving Miss Daisy</em> (Zanuck, Zanuck &amp; Beresford, 1989) is reminiscent of Poitier's Homer Smith in <em>Lilies of the Field</em>. Neither Hoke nor Homer has a life apart from whites. We know little of either character's
                                    experiences or hopes. They live to solve the problems of the white characters; and,
                                    of course, both are desexed. Although neither Hoke nor Homer Smith is a fully developed
                                    character, both are preferable to Big George in <em>Fried Green Tomatoes</em> (Avnet, Kemer &amp; Avnet, 1991). Big George is a pliant, obedient, one-dimensional servant,
                                    a relic.

                                    In the 1890s Dixon's Carburet of Iron Stove Polish used "Uncle Obadiah" in their advertisements.
                                    He is elderly, frail, with ragged clothes, but he is smiling. In the 1920s Schulze
                                    Baking Company used the image of an old banjo-strumming Tom on its advertisement selling
                                    Uncle Wabash Cupcakes. In the 1940s Listerine used a black porter in its magazine
                                    advertisements, and Mil-Kay Vitamin Drinks used a smiling black waiter on its posters
                                    and billboards. A 1950s souvenir tip tray from The Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia,
                                    shows a smiling black waiter balancing plates on his head. In the 1940s Converted
                                    Rice changed the name of its major product to Uncle Ben's Brand Rice, and began using
                                    the image of a smiling, elderly black man on its package. Arguably the most enduring
                                    commercial Tom is "Rastus," the Cream of Wheat Cook.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Rastus was created in 1893 by Emery Mapes, one of the owners of North Dakota's Diamond
                                    Milling Company.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>2</span></span></sup> He wanted a likable image to help sell packages of "breakfast porridge." Mapes, a
                                    former printer, remembered the image of a black chef among his stock of old printing
                                    blocks. He made a template of the chef and named the product Cream of Wheat. The original
                                    logo showed a black chef holding a skillet in one hand and a bowl of Cream of Wheat
                                    in the other (Siegel, 1992). This logo was used until the 1920s when Mapes, impressed
                                    by the "wholesome" looks of a Chicago waiter serving him breakfast, created a new
                                    chef. The waiter was paid five dollars to pose as the second Rastus in a chef's hat
                                    and jacket. The image of this unknown man has appeared, with only slight modifications,
                                    on Cream of Wheat boxes for almost ninety years.

                                         height="300" /> Rastus, like Aunt Jemima, is more than a company trademark -- he is arguably a cultural
                                    icon. Rastus is marketed as a symbol of wholeness and stability. The toothy, well-dressed
                                    black chef happily serves breakfast to a nation. In 1898 Cream of Wheat began advertising
                                    in national magazines. These advertisements were often reproduced as posters. Many
                                    of those advertisements are, by today's standards, racially insensitive. For example,
                                    a 1915 Cream of Wheat poster shows "Uncle Sam" looking at a picture of Rastus holding
                                    a bowl of the cereal. The caption reads "Well, You're Helping Some!" This may have
                                    been a suggestion that blacks were contributing little to the war effort. A 1921 Cream
                                    of Wheat poster shows a young white boy sitting in a rickshaw that is being pulled
                                    by an elderly black man. The man has stopped to smoke. The smiling boy, waving a whip-like
                                    stick, says, "Giddap, Uncle." Often Rastus is portrayed as barely literate. In a 1921
                                    advertisement, Rastus, smiling, his gums showing, holds a sign which reads:
                                 </p>

                                 <p>In many African American communities "Uncle Tom" is a slur used to disparage a black
                                    person who is humiliatingly subservient or deferential to white people. Derived from
                                    Stowe's character, the modern use is a perversion of her original portrayal. The contemporary
                                    use of the slur has two variations. Version A is the black person who is a docile,
                                    loyal, religious, contented servant who accommodates himself to a lowly status. Version
                                    B is the ambitious black person who subordinates himself in order to achieve a more
                                    favorable status within the dominant society. In both instances, the person is believed
                                    to overly identify with whites, in Version A because of fear, in Version B because
                                    of opportunism. This latter use is more common today.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>"Uncle Tom," unlike most anti-black slurs, is primarily used by blacks against blacks.
                                    Its synonyms include "oreo," "sell-out," "uncle," "race-traitor," and "white man's
                                    negro." It is an in-group term used as a social control mechanism. Garth Baker-Fletcher
                                    (1993) has said,
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> The "Uncle Tom" appellation is the feared curse of every African American who is
                                    compelled to work under whites, while simultaneously holding a position of authority
                                    over other African Americans. Thus "Uncle Tom" can be pulled out by blacks as a superior
                                    ideological weapon to enforce patterns of racial unity against the perceived threats
                                    of a white boss. (p. 39)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>Black political conservatives, especially Republicans, are often labeled "Uncle Toms"
                                    or "Toms." Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; Alan Keyes, the Republican presidential
                                    candidate; Shelby Steele, the professor and author; Thomas Sowell, the economist;
                                    and Walter Williams, the neighborhood activist, have all been publicly called "Uncle
                                    Toms." They are accused of being white-identified opportunists. Their motives are
                                    impugned. The November 1996 issue of <em>Emerge</em> magazine had a cover with Justice Thomas dressed as a lawn jockey and these words:
                                    "Uncle Thomas, Lawn Jockey for the Far Right." Inside the magazine a grinning Justice
                                    Thomas shines Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's shoes.

                                 <p>Black public figures who oppose affirmative action or busing are often accused of
                                    pleasing whites only to elevate themselves -- socially, politically, and economically.
                                    They publicly say about race what conservative whites dare not say: crime and welfare
                                    are black phenomena, affirmative action is reverse discrimination, and white racism

                                    at least publicly. To their opponents these men represent Version B Uncle Toms.

                                    Whitney Young, Executive Director of the Urban League from 1961 to 1971, was a "radical
                                    integrationist." His willingness to work with whites led to charges that he was an
                                    "Uncle Tom." Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.'s unwillingness to advocate retaliatory
                                    violence led Stokely Carmichael to accuse him of "Uncle Tomism." Bayard Rustin, one
                                    of the chief tacticians of the Civil Rights Movement, was also called an "Uncle Tom"
                                    by black militants ("Bayard Rustin Obituary", 1987). Roy Wilkins was called an "Uncle
                                    Tom" because he publicly stated that blacks could achieve political power "in the
                                    system." Civil rights leaders were judged to be too passive, too religious, too eager
                                    to integrate -- too much like the stereotypical Version A "Uncle Tom." Older, more
                                    established blacks have often been accused of being too conservative, too passive,
                                    and too desirous of white approval. In the 1950s Louis Armstrong was called an "Uncle
                                    Tom" by young bebop musicians.

                                 <p>Sports champions, especially those who publicly express conservative political views,
                                    run the risk of being labeled "Uncle Toms." After retiring from baseball, Jackie Robinson
                                    wrote a newspaper column about civil rights issues. He was vilified in the black community
                                    when he announced that he was a "Rockefeller Republican." Arthur Ashe, the tennis
                                    champion and human rights activist, was called an "Uncle Tom" for playing in the South
                                    African Open tennis tournament in 1973. His participation was seen as supporting apartheid.
                                    Muhammad Ali routinely berated his black opponents as "Uncle Toms." In 1965 Ali fought
                                    Floyd Patterson, a devout Christian and staunch integrationist. Patterson used these
                                    words to criticize Ali for becoming a Black Muslim:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> Cassius Clay [Ali's former name] is disgracing himself and the Negro race. No decent
                                    person can look up to a champion whose credo is "hate whites." I have nothing but
                                    contempt for the Black Muslims and that for which they stand. The image of a Black
                                    Muslim as the world heavyweight champion disgraces the sport and the nation. Cassius
                                    Clay must be beaten and the Black Muslims' scourge removed from boxing. (Goldberg,
                                    1997)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>Ali not only called Patterson an "Uncle Tom" and "the technicolor white hope," but
                                    he predicted: "I'm gonna put him flat on his back, so that he will start acting Black;
                                    because when he was champ he didn't do as he should, he tried to force himself into
                                    an all-White neighborhood" (Goldberg). During the fight -- a one-sided bout -- Ali
                                    toyed with Patterson. Ali threw both punches and the slur, "white nigger."

                                    Terrell repeatedly called Ali by his given name: Cassius Clay. Ali promised to beat
                                    Terrell until he addressed him properly.<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>3</span></span></sup> In a fight which <em>Sports Illustrated</em> (Maule, 1967) described as "a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous
                                    display of cruelty," Ali beat Terrell while shouting, "What's my name, 'Uncle Tom,'
                                    what's my name?" Before their first fight, on March 8, 1971, Ali called Joe Frazier
                                    an "Uncle Tom" and said that whites would be cheering for Frazier (Cassidy, 1999).
                                    He also used the slur against Joe Louis because of Louis' passive political stances.

                                 <p>In recent years the "Uncle Tom" slur has been directed against Christopher Darden,
                                    the black member of the prosecution's team in the O.J. Simpson murder trial; Detroit
                                    Mayor Dennis Archer; Karl Malone, the Utah Jazz basketball player; and Colin Powell.
                                    Cornell West, the author of <em>Race Matters</em> (1993) and a lifelong civil rights activist, was called an "Uncle Tom" by the African
                                    United Front (1993) because of his "support" of Jews. The "Uncle Tom" slur has even
                                    been appropriated by other ethnic groups to exert in-group pressures on their members.
                                    A Native American, for example, who is believed to be too friendly with or admiring
                                    of whites, is called an "Uncle Tomahawk"; Chinese Americans use the term "Uncle Tong."
                                    Even W.E.B. DuBois, arguably the greatest, most sustained civil rights voice of the
                                    20th Century, was called an "Uncle Tom" -- by Marcus Garvey, who added that DuBois
                                    was "purely and simply a white man's nigger" (Williams, 1997).<sup><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>4</span></span></sup><br /><br /> © <span style="font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span>Dr. David Pilgrim, Professor of Sociology<br /> Ferris State University<br /> Dec., 2000<br /> Edited 2012<br /></span></span></p>

                                          in <em>Lovings v. Virginia</em>, that the United States Supreme Court ruled laws which forbade interracial marriages
