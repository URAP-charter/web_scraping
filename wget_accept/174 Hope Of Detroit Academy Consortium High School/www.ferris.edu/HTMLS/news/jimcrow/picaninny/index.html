                                 They were "child coons," miniature versions of Stepin Fetchit (see Pilgrim (2000)).
                                 Picaninnies had bulging eyes, unkempt hair, red lips, and wide mouths into which they
                                 stuffed huge slices of watermelon. They were themselves tasty morsels for alligators.
                                 They were routinely shown on postcards, posters, and other ephemera being chased or
                                 eaten. Picaninnies were portrayed as nameless, shiftless natural buffoons running
                                 from alligators and toward fried chicken.
                                 
                                 <p>The first famous picaninny was Topsy -- a poorly dressed, disreputable, neglected
                                    slave girl. Topsy appeared in Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>. Topsy was created to show the evils of slavery. Here was an untamable "wild child"
                                    who had been indelibly corrupted by slavery.
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;"> She was one of the blackest of her race; and her round, shining eyes, glittering
                                    as glass beads, moved with quick and restless glances over everything in the room.
                                    Her mouth half open with astonishment at the wonders of the new Mas'r's parlor, displayed
                                    a white and brilliant set of teeth. Her woolly hair was braided in sundry little tails,
                                    which stuck out in every direction. The expression of her face was an odd mixture
                                    of shrewdness and cunning, over which was oddly drawn, like a veil, an expression
                                    of the most doleful gravity and solemnity. She was dressed in a single filthy, ragged
                                    garment, made of bagging; and stood with her hands demurely folded in front of her.
                                    Altogether, there was something odd and goblin-like about her appearance -- something
                                    as Miss Ophelia afterwards said, "so heathenish..." (p. 258)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>Stowe hoped that readers would be heartbroken by the tribulations of Topsy, and would
                                    help end slavery -- which, she believed, produced many similar children. Her book,
                                    while leading some Americans to question the morality of slavery, was used by others
                                    to trivialize slavery's brutality. Topsy, for example, was soon a staple character
                                    in minstrel shows. The stage Topsy, unlike Stowe's version, was a happy, mirthful
                                    character who reveled in her misfortune. Topsy was still dirty, with kinky hair and
                                    ragged clothes, but these traits were transformed into comic props--as was her misuse
                                    of the English language. No longer a sympathetic figure, Topsy became, simply, a harmless
                                    coon. The stage Topsy and her imitators remained popular from the early 1850s well
                                    into the twentieth century (Turner, 1994, p. 14).
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Black children were some of the earliest "stars" of the fledgling motion picture industry;
                                    albeit, as picaninnies (Bogle, 1994, p. 7). Thomas Alva Edison patented 1,093 inventions.
                                    In 1891 he invented the kinetoscope and the kinetograph, which laid the groundwork
                                    for modern motion picture technology. During his camera experiments in 1893, Edison
                                    photographed some black children as "interesting side effects." In 1904 he presented
                                    <em>Ten Picaninnies</em>, which showed those "side effects" running and playing. These nameless children were
                                    referred to as inky kids, smoky kids, black lambs, snowballs, chubbie ebonies, bad
                                    chillun, and coons.

                                 <p>The <em>Ten Picaninnies</em> was a forerunner to Hal Roach's <em>Our Gang</em> series -- sometimes referred to as <em>The Little Rascals</em>. First produced in 1922, <em>Our Gang</em> continued into the "talkie era." Roach described the show as "comedies of child life."
                                    It included an interracial cast of children, including, at various times, these black
                                    characters: Sunshine Sammy, Pineapple, and Farina in the 1920s, and later, Stymie
                                    and Buckwheat. One or two black children appeared in each short episode.

                                    Negro" (Leab, 1976, p. 46). All of the children, blacks and whites, took turns playing
                                    nitwits. Donald Bogle (1994) wrote: "Indeed, the charming sense of <em>Our Gang</em> was that all of the children were buffoons, forever in scraps and scrapes, forever
                                    plagued by setbacks and sidetracks as they set out to have fun, and everyone had his
                                    turn at being outwitted" (p. 23). While this is true, the black characters were often
                                    buffoons in racially stereotypical ways. They spoke in dialect -- <em>dis, dat, I is, you is</em>, and <em>we is</em>. Farina, arguably the most famous picaninny of the 1920s, was on more than one occasion
                                    shown savagely eating watermelon or chicken. He was also terrified of ghosts -- this
                                    fear was a persistent theme for adult coons in later comedy films. Farina and Buckwheat
                                    wore tightly twisted "picaninny pigtails" and old patched gingham clothes which made
                                    their sex ambiguous. Why was this sexual ambiguity a necessary part of the show? Buckwheat,
                                    the quiet boy with big eyes, has an unenviable distinction: his name is now synonymous
                                    with picaninny. This is due, in large part, to Eddie Murphy's depiction of Buckwheat
                                    on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in the 1980s. Indeed, the term picaninny is today rarely used as a racial slur; it
                                    has been replaced by the term buckwheat.

                                 <p>Picaninnies as portrayed in material culture have skin coloring ranging from medium
                                    brown to dark black -- light skinned picaninnies are rare. They include infants and
                                    teenagers; however, most appear to be 8-10 years old. Prissy, the inept and hysterical
                                    servant girl in <em>Gone With the Wind</em> (Selznick &amp; Fleming, 1939) was an exception. She was older than the typical picaninny,
                                    but her character was functionally a picaninny. Picaninny girls (and sometimes boys)
                                    have hair tied or matted in short stalks that point in all directions; often the boys
                                    are bald, their heads shining like metal. The children have big, wide eyes, and oversized
                                    mouths -- ostensibly to accommodate huge pieces of watermelon.

                                    torn, old and oversized clothes, or, and worse, they are shown as nude or near-nude.
                                    This nudity suggests that black children, and by extension black parents, are not
                                    concerned with modesty. The nudity also implies that black parents neglect their children.
                                    A loving parent would provide clothing. The nudity of black children suggests that
                                    blacks are less civilized than whites (who wear clothes).

                                 <p>The nudity is also problematic because it sexualizes these children. Black children
                                    are shown with exposed genitalia and buttocks -- often without apparent shame. Moreover,
                                    the buttocks are often exaggerated in size, that is, black children are shown with
                                    the buttocks of adults. The widespread depictions of nudity among black children normalizes
                                    their sexual objectification, and, by extension, justifies the sexual abuse of these
                                    children.

                                 <p> A disproportionately high number of African American children are poor, but the picaninny
                                    caricature suggests that all black children are impoverished. This poverty is evidenced
                                    by their ragged clothes. The children are hungry, therefore, they steal chickens and
                                    watermelon. Like wild animals, the picaninnies often must fend for themselves.

                                    insignificant beings. Stories like <em>Ten Little Niggers</em> show Black children being rolled over by boulders, chased by alligators, and set
                                    on fire. Black children are shown on postcards being attacked by dogs, chickens, pigs
                                    and other animals. This is consistent with the many 19th and 20th century pseudo-scientific
                                    theories which claimed that blacks were destined for extinction. William Smith, a
                                    Tulane University professor, published <em>The Color Line</em> in 1905. He argued that blacks would die off because the "doom that awaits the Negro
                                    has been prepared in like measure for all inferior races" (Fredrickson, 1971, p. 257).
                                    George Fredrickson's <em>The Black Image in the White Mind</em> includes an excellent discussion of the "black race will die" theories (pp. 71-164).

                                 <p>Picaninnies were often depicted side by side with animals. For example, a 1907 postcard,
                                    showed a Black child on his knees looking at a pig. The caption read, "Whose Baby
                                    is OO?" A 1930s bisque match holder showed a black baby emerging from an egg while
                                    a rooster looked on. On postcards black children were often referred to as coons,
                                    monkeys, crows, and opossums. A 1930s pinback2 showed a bird with the head of a black
                                    girl. Picaninnies were "shown crawling on the ground, climbing trees, straddled over
                                    logs, or in other ways assuming animal-like postures" (Turner, p. 15). The message
                                    was this: black children are more animal than human.

                                 <p>Arguably, the most controversial picaninny image is the one created by Helen Bannerman.
                                    Born Brodie Cowie Watson, the daughter of a Scottish minister, she married Will Bannerman,
                                    a surgeon in the British Army of India. She spent thirty years of her life in India.
                                    She regularly wrote illustrated letters with fantasy storylines to entertain their
                                    children. In 1898 there "came into her head, evolved by the moving of a train," the
                                    entertaining story of a little black boy, beautifully clothed, who outwits a succession
                                    of tigers, and not only saves his own life but gets a stack of tiger-striped pancakes
                                    (Bader, 1996, p. 536). The story eventually became <em>Little Black Sambo</em>. The book appeared in England in 1899 and was an immediate success. The next year
                                    it was published in the United States by Frederick A. Stokes, a mainstream publisher.
                                    It was even more successful than it had been in England. The book's success led to
                                    many imitators -- and controversies. Barbara Bader (1996), a book critic, summarized
                                    the events.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <ul>All American children did not see the same book, however. Though the authorized Stokes
                                    edition sold well and never went out of print, a host of other versions quickly began
                                    to appear from mass-market publishers, from reprint houses, from small, outlying firms
                                    unconstrained by the mutual courtesies of the major publishers. A few are straight
                                    knock-offs of the book that Bannerman made, without her name on the title page; the
                                    majority were reillustrated -- with gross, degrading caricatures that set Sambo down
                                    on the old plantation or, with equal distortiveness, deposited him in Darkest Africa.
                                    Libraries stocked the Stokes edition, and a few others selectively. But overall the
                                    bootleg Sambos were much cheaper, more widely distributed, and vastly more numerous.(pp.
                                    537-538)
                                 </ul>
                                 
                                 <p>Was Bannerman's <em>Little Black Sambo</em> racist? The major characters: Little Black Sambo, his mother (Black Mumbo) and his
                                    father (Black Jumbo) used standard English, not the bastardized English then associated
                                    with blacks. Stereotypical anti-black traits -- for example, laziness, stupidity,
                                    and immorality -- were absent from the book. Little Black Sambo, the character, was
                                    bright and resourceful unlike most portrayals of black children. Nevertheless, the
                                    book does have anti-black overtones, most notably the illustrations. Sambo is crudely
                                    drawn, an obvious caricature. Some Bannerman supporters claim that Sambo is not even
                                    black, that he is actually Indian (South Asian, not American Indian). This seems unlikely.
                                    Bannerman could have drawn an Indian character if that was her intention, the Little
                                    Black Sambo character is very dark, has a broad nose, and the stereotypical exaggerated
                                    red lips and rolling eyes found in black caricatures. His only South Asian feature
                                    is the hair, which is black but not kinky. The little hero is black, not South Asian.
                                    Black Mumbo is drawn as a stereotypical American looking mammy, though she is not
                                    obese. The caricature of Black Jumbo is softer, though it is similar to the Dandy
                                    caricature. The names Mumbo and Jumbo also make the characters seem nonsensical at
                                    a time when blacks were routinely thought to be inherently dumb.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The illustrations were racially offensive, and so was the name Sambo. At the time
                                    that the book was originally published Sambo was an established anti-black epithet,
                                    a generic degrading reference. It symbolized the lazy, grinning, docile, childlike,

                                    For many African Americans <em>Little Black Sambo</em> was an entertaining story ruined by racist pictures and racist names. Julius Lester
                                    (1997), who has recently co-authored <em>Sam and the Tigers</em> (Lester, Bannerman, Pinkney, &amp; Bierhorst, 1996), an updated Afrocentric version of
                                    <em>Little Black Sambo</em>, wrote:

                                 <ul>as a child, I had no choice but to identify with him because I am black and so was
                                    he. Even as I sit here and write the feelings of shame, embarrassment and hurt come
                                    back. And there was a bit of confusion because I liked the story and I especially
                                    liked all those pancakes, but the illustrations exaggerated the racial features society
                                    had made it clear to me represented my racial inferiority -- the black, black skin,
                                    the eyes shining white, the red protruding lips. I did not feel good about myself
                                    as a black child looking at those pictures.
                                 </ul>
                                 
                                 <p>It is likely that Bannerman did not intentionally write <em>Little Black Sambo</em> to offend any group; after all, the story was conceived as a private fantasy tale
                                    to share with her children. It is also likely that she did not understand the racist
                                    overtones of the book. She tried to write an "exotic" tale. The book reflects, but
                                    does not exceed, the prevailing anti-black imaging of her time. Nevertheless, illustrations
                                    in <em>Little Black Sambo</em> are caricatures. She also depicted dark-skinned people in caricature form in her
                                    other books, including, <em>Little Black Mingo</em> (1902) and <em>Little Black Quibba</em> (1902). She used realistic, non-caricatured drawings of white characters in her books
                                    such as <em>Pat and the Spider</em> (1904), and <em>Little White Squibba</em> (1966).

                                    racist drawings and dialogue. The vulgar reprint versions were symbolic of black-white
                                    relations. <em>Little Black Sambo's</em> popularity coincided with the crystallization of Jim Crow laws and etiquette. Blacks
                                    were denied basic human and civil rights, discriminated against in the labor market,
                                    barred from many public schools and libraries, harassed at voting booths, subjected
                                    to physical violence, and generally treated as second class citizens. The year that
                                    <em>Little Black Sambo</em> came to America a white-initiated race riot occurred in New Orleans. It was effectively
                                    a pogrom -- blacks were beaten, their schools and homes destroyed. <em>Little Black Sambo</em> did not, of course, cause riots, but it entered America during a period of strained
                                    and harsh race relations. It was, simply, another insult in the daily lives of African
                                    Americans.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The anti-<em>Little Black Sambo</em> movement started in the 1930s and continued into the 1970s. Black educators and civil
                                    rights leaders organized numerous campaigns to get the book banned from public libraries,
                                    especially in elementary schools. In 1932 Langston Hughes said <em>Little Black Sambo</em> exemplified the "pickaninny variety" of storybook, "amusing undoubtedly to the white
                                    child, but like an unkind word to one who has known too many hurts to enjoy the additional
                                    pain of being laughed at" (Von Drasek, 2009). In the 1940s and 1950s the book was
                                    dropped from many lists of "Recommended Books." By the 1960s the book was seen as
                                    a remnant of a racist past.

                                 <p><em>Little Black Sambo</em> was again popular by the mid-1990s. Its recent popularity is a result of many factors,
                                    including a white backlash against perceived political correctness. This is evident
                                    in internet discussions. Americans, black and white, are rereading the original book
                                    (and some of the unauthorized reprints). There is agreement that Bannerman's book
                                    is entertaining. However, there is little agreement regarding whether it is racist.
                                    White readers tend to focus on Bannerman's non-racist intentions and the unfairness
                                    of judging yesterday's "classics" by today's standards of racial equality. Blacks
                                    find the book's title and the illustrations offensive. Most of the debate centers
                                    on Bannerman's version; there is no debating the racism explicit in later editions
                                    of the book produced by other writers and publishers.

                                 <p>In 1996 two readaptions of <em>Little Black Sambo</em> were published. <em>The Story of Little Babaji</em>, by Fred Marcellino (Bannerman &amp; Marcellino), set the story in India, not Africa.
                                    Also, the characters' names were changed to Babaji, Mamaji, and Papaji. It used the
                                    Bannerman text but Marcellino drew non-caricatured illustrations. The book is uncontroversial.
                                    <em>Sam and the Tigers</em> (Lester et al.), written by Julius Lester and illustrated by Jerry Pinkney, is a
                                    retelling of the story in a folksy, southern black voice. The story's setting is not
                                    Africa or India, but a mythical southern town "where the animals and the people lived
                                    and worked together like they didn't know they weren't supposed to." There are still
                                    tigers that Sam must outwit, but Lester's tale is contemporary. For example, after
                                    one tiger threatens to eat him, Sam says, "If you do it'll send your cholesterol way
                                    up." If Bannerman had used different names for the book and characters, and had used
                                    realistic, not caricatured, illustrations, there would be little need for the Marcellino
