                                 The Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University has more than 100 items with the mammy
                                 image, including ashtrays, souvenirs, postcards, fishing lures, detergent, artistic
                                 prints, toys, candles, and kitchenware. This article examines real mammies, fictional
                                 mammies, and commercial mammies.

                                 <hr />
                                 
                                 <p>From slavery through the Jim Crow era, the mammy image served the political, social,
                                    and economic interests of mainstream white America. During slavery, the mammy caricature
                                    was posited as proof that blacks -- in this case, black women -- were contented, even
                                    happy, as slaves. Her wide grin, hearty laugher, and loyal servitude were offered
                                    as evidence of the supposed humanity of the institution of slavery.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>This was the mammy caricature, and, like all caricatures, it contained a little truth
                                    surrounded by a larger lie. The caricature portrayed an obese, coarse, maternal figure.
                                    She had great love for her white "family," but often treated her own family with disdain.
                                    Although she had children, sometimes many, she was completely desexualized. She "belonged"
                                    to the white family, though it was rarely stated. Unlike Sambo, she was a faithful
                                    worker. She had no black friends; the white family was her entire world. Obviously,
                                    the mammy caricature was more myth than accurate portrayal.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Catherine Clinton (1982), a historian, claimed that real antebellum mammies were rare:</p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Records do acknowledge the presence of female slaves who served as the "right hand"
                                    of plantation mistresses. Yet documents from the planter class during the first fifty
                                    years following the American Revolution reveal only a handful of such examples. Not
                                    until after Emancipation did black women run white households or occupy in any significant
                                    number the special positions ascribed to them in folklore and fiction. The Mammy was
                                    created by white Southerners to redeem the relationship between black women and white
                                    men within slave society in response to the antislavery attack from the North during
                                    the ante-bellum period. In the primary records from before the Civil War, hard evidence
                                    for its existence simply does not appear.(pp. 201-202)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>According to Patricia Turner (1994), Professor of African American and African Studies,
                                    before the Civil War only very wealthy whites could afford the luxury of "utilizing
                                    the (black) women as house servants rather than as field hands" (p. 44). Moreover,
                                    Turner claims that house servants were usually mixed raced, skinny (blacks were not
                                    given much food), and young (fewer than 10 percent of black women lived beyond fifty
                                    years). Why were the fictional mammies so different from their real-life counterparts?
                                    The answer lies squarely within the complex sexual relations between blacks and whites.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Abolitionists claimed that one of the many brutal aspects of slavery was that slave
                                    owners sexually exploited their female slaves, especially light-skinned ones who approximated
                                    the mainstream definition of female sexual attractiveness. The mammy caricature was
                                    deliberately constructed to suggest ugliness. Mammy was portrayed as dark-skinned,
                                    often pitch black, in a society that regarded black skin as ugly, tainted. She was
                                    obese, sometimes morbidly overweight. Moreover, she was often portrayed as old, or
                                    at least middle-aged. The attempt was to desexualize mammy. The implicit assumption
                                    was this: No reasonable white man would choose a fat, elderly black woman instead
                                    of the idealized white woman. The black mammy was portrayed as lacking all sexual
                                    and sensual qualities. The de-eroticism of mammy meant that the white wife -- and
                                    by extension, the white family, was safe.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The sexual exploitation of black women by white men was unfortunately common during
                                    the antebellum period, and this was true irrespective of the economic relationship
                                    involved; in other words, black women were sexually exploited by rich whites, middle
                                    class whites, and poor whites. Sexual relations between blacks and whites -- whether
                                    consensual or rapes -- were taboo; yet they occurred often. All black women and girls,
                                    regardless of their physical appearances, were vulnerable to being sexually assaulted
                                    by white men. The mammy caricature tells many lies; in this case, the lie is that
                                    white men did not find black women sexually desirable.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The mammy caricature implied that black women were only fit to be domestic workers;
                                    thus, the stereotype became a rationalization for economic discrimination. During
                                    the Jim Crow period, approximately 1877 to 1966, America's race-based, race-segregated
                                    job economy limited most blacks to menial, low paying, low status jobs. Black women
                                    found themselves forced into one job category, house servant. Jo Ann Gibson Robinson
                                    (1987), a biographer of the Civil Rights Movement, described the limited opportunities
                                    for black women in the 1950s:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Jobs for clerks in dimestores, cashiers in markets, and telephone operators were numerous,
                                    but were not open to black women. A fifty-dollar-a-week worker could employ a black
                                    domestic to clean her home, cook the food, wash and iron clothes, and nurse the baby
                                    for as little as twenty dollars per week. (p. 107)</span>
                                 
                                 <p>During slavery only the very wealthy could afford to "purchase" black women and use
                                    them as "house servants," but during Jim Crow even middle class white women could
                                    hire black domestic workers. These black women were not mammies. Mammy was "black,
                                    fat with huge breasts, and head covered with a kerchief to hide her nappy hair, strong,
                                    kind, loyal, sexless, religious and superstitious" (Christian, 1980, pp. 11-12). She
                                    spoke bastardized English; she did not care about her appearance. She was politically
                                    safe. She was culturally safe. She was, of course, a figment of the white imagination,
                                    a nostalgic yearning for a reality that never had been. The real-life black domestics
                                    of the Jim Crow era were poor women denied other opportunities. They performed many
                                    of the duties of the fictional mammies, but, unlike the caricature, they were dedicated
                                    to their own families, and often resentful of their lowly societal status.

                                 <p>The slavery-era mammy did not want to be free. She was too busy serving as surrogate
                                    mother/grandmother to white families. Mammy was so loyal to her white family that
                                    she was often willing to risk her life to defend them. In D. W. Griffith's movie <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> (1915) -- based on Thomas Dixon's racist novel <em>The Clansman</em> (1905) -- the mammy defends her white master's home against black and white Union
                                    soldiers. The message was clear: Mammy would rather fight than be free. In the famous
                                    movie <em>Gone With The Wind</em> (Selznick &amp; Fleming, 1939), the black mammy also fights black soldiers whom she believes
                                    to be a threat to the white mistress of the house.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Mammy found life on vaudeville stages, in novels, in plays, and finally, in films
                                    and on television. White men, wearing black face makeup, did vaudeville skits as Sambos,
                                    Mammies, and other anti-black stereotypes. The standard for mammy depictions was offered
                                    by Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 book, <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>. The book's mammy, Aunt Chloe, is described in this way:
                                 </p>
                                 <span style="font-family: Courier New;">A round, black, shiny face is hers, so glossy as to suggest the idea that she might
                                    have been washed over with the whites of eggs, like one of her own tea rusks. Her
                                    whole plump countenance beams with satisfaction and contentment from under a well-starched
                                    checkered turban, bearing on it; however, if we must confess it, a little of that
                                    tinge of self-consciousness which becomes the first cook of the neighborhood, as Aunt
                                    Chloe was universally held and acknowledged to be.(Stowe, 1966, p. 31)</span>

                                         height="302" /> Aunt Chloe was nurturing and protective of "her" white family, but less caring toward
                                    her own children. She is the prototypical fictional mammy: self-sacrificing, white-identified,
                                    fat, asexual, good-humored, a loyal cook, housekeeper and quasi-family member.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>During the first half of the 1900s, while black Americans were demanding political,
                                    social, and economic advancement, Mammy was increasingly popular in the field of entertainment.
                                    The first talking movie was 1927's <em>The Jazz Singer</em> (Crosland) with Al Jolson in blackface singing "Mammy." In 1934 the movie <em>Imitation of Life</em> (Laemmle &amp; Stahl) told the story of a black maid, Aunt Delilah (played by Louise
                                    Beavers) who inherited a pancake recipe. This movie mammy gave the valuable recipe
                                    to Miss Bea, her boss. Miss Bea successfully marketed the recipe. She offered Aunt
                                    Delilah a <em>twenty percent</em> interest in the pancake company.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>"You'll have your own car. Your own house," Miss Bea tells Aunt Delilah. Mammy is
                                    frightened. "My own house? You gonna send me away, Miss Bea? I can't live with you?
                                    Oh, Honey Chile, please don't send me away." Aunt Delilah, though she had lived her
                                    entire life in poverty, does not want her own house. "How I gonna take care of you
                                    and Miss Jessie (Miss Bea's daughter) if I ain't here... I'se your cook. And I want
                                    to stay your cook." Regarding the pancake recipe, Aunt Delilah said, "I gives it to
                                    you, Honey. I makes you a present of it" (Bogle, 1994, p. 57). Aunt Delilah worked
                                    to keep the white family stable, but her own family disintegrated -- her self-hating
                                    daughter rejected her, then ran away from home to "pass for white." Near the movie's
                                    conclusion, Aunt Delilah dies "of a broken heart."
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p><em>Imitation of Life</em> was probably the highlight of Louise Beavers' acting career. Almost all of her characters,
                                    before and after the Aunt Delilah role, were mammy or mammy-like. She played hopelessly
                                    naive maids in Mae West's <em>She Done Him Wrong</em> (Sherman, 1933), and Jean Harlow's Bombshell (Stromberg &amp; Fleming, 1933). She played
                                    loyal servants in <em>Made for Each Other</em> (Selznick &amp; Cromwell, 1939), and <em>Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House</em> (Frank, Panama &amp; Potter, 1948), and several other movies.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Beavers had a weight problem: it was a constant battle for her to stay overweight.
                                    She often wore padding to give her the appearance of a mammy. Also, she had been reared
                                    in California, and she had to fabricate a southern accent. Moreover, she detested
                                    cooking. She was truly a fictional mammy.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p><em>Imitation of Life</em> was remade (without the pancake recipe storyline) in 1959 (Hunter &amp; Sirk). It starred
                                    Lana Turner as the white mistress, and Juanita Moore (in an Oscar-nominated Best Supporting
                                    Actress performance) as the mammy. It was also a tear-jerker.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Hattie McDaniel was another well known mammy portrayer. In her early films, for example
                                    <em>The Golden West</em> (Grainger &amp; Howard, 1932), and <em>The Story of Temple Drake</em> (Glazer &amp; Roberts, 1933), she played unobtrusive, weak mammies. However, her role
                                    in <em>Judge Priest</em> (Wurtzel &amp; Ford, 1934) signaled the beginning of the sassy, quick-tempered mammies
                                    that she popularized. She played the saucy mammy in many movies, including, <em>Music is Magic</em> (Stone &amp; Marshall, 1935), <em>The Little Colonel</em> (DeSylva &amp; Butler, 1935), <em>Alice Adams</em> (Berman &amp; Stevens, 1935), <em>Saratoga</em> (Hyman &amp; Conway, 1937), and <em>The Mad Miss Manton</em> (Wolfson &amp; Jason, 1938). In 1939, she played Scarlett O'Hara's sassy but loyal servant
                                    in <em>Gone With the Wind</em>. McDaniel won an Oscar for best supporting actress, the first black to win an Academy
                                    Award.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Hattie McDaniel was a gifted actress who added depth to the character of mammy; unfortunately,
                                    she, like almost all blacks from the 1920s through 1950s, was typecast as a servant.
                                    She was often criticized by blacks for perpetuating the mammy caricature. She responded
                                    this way: "Why should I complain about making seven thousand dollars a week playing
                                    a maid? If I didn't, I'd be making seven dollars a week actually being one" (Bogle,
                                    1994, p. 82).

                                 <p><em>Beulah</em> was a television show, popular from 1950 to 1953, in which a mammy nurtures a white
                                    suburban family. Hattie McDaniel originated the role for radio; Louise Beavers performed
                                    the role on television. The Beulah image resurfaced in the 1980s when Nell Carter,
                                    a talented black singer, played a mammy-like role on the situation comedy <em>Gimme a Break</em>. She was dark-skinned, overweight, sassy, white-identified, and like Aunt Delilah
                                    in <em>Imitation of Life</em>, content to live in her white employer's home and nurture the white family.

                                    grew in popularity during the period of Jim Crow. The mainstreaming of Mammy was primarily,
                                    but not exclusively, the result of the fledging advertising industry. The mammy image
                                    was used to sell almost any household item, especially breakfast foods, detergents,
                                    planters, ashtrays, sewing accessories, and beverages. As early as 1875, Aunt Sally,
                                    a Mammy image, appeared on cans of baking powder. Later, different Mammy images appeared
                                    on Luzianne coffee and cleaners, Fun to Wash detergent, Aunt Dinah molasses, and other
                                    products. Mammy represented wholesomeness. You can trust the mammy pitchwoman.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Mammy's most successful commercial expression was (and is) Aunt Jemima. In 1889, Charles
                                    Rutt, a Missouri newspaper editor, and Charles G. Underwood, a mill owner, developed
                                    the idea of a self-rising flour that only needed water. He called it Aunt Jemima's
                                    recipe. Rutt borrowed the Aunt Jemima name from a popular vaudeville song that he
                                    had heard performed by a team of minstrel performers. The minstrels included a skit
                                    with a southern mammy. Rutt decided to use the name and the image of the mammy-like
                                    Aunt Jemima to promote his new pancake mix. Unfortunately for him, he and his partner
                                    lacked the necessary capital to effectively promote and market the product. They sold
                                    the pancake recipe and the accompanying Aunt Jemima marketing idea to the R.T. Davis
                                    Mill Company.
                                 </p>

                                         height="200" /> The R.T. Davis Company improved the pancake formula, and, more importantly, they
                                    developed an advertising plan to use a real person to portray Aunt Jemima. The woman
                                    they found to serve as the live model was Nancy Green, who was born a slave in Kentucky
                                    in 1834. She impersonated Aunt Jemima until her death in 1923. Struggling with profits,
                                    R.T. Davis Company made the bold decision to risk their entire fortune and future
                                    on a promotional exhibition at the 1893 World's Exposition in Chicago. The Company
                                    constructed the world's largest flour barrel, 24 feet high and 12 feet across. Standing
                                    near the basket, Nancy Green, dressed as Aunt Jemima, sang songs, cooked pancakes,
                                    and told stories about the Old South -- stories which presented the South as a happy
                                    place for blacks and whites alike. She was a huge success. She had served tens of
                                    thousands of pancakes by the time the fair ended. Her success established her as a
                                    national celebrity. Her image was plastered on billboards nationwide, with the caption,
                                    "I'se in town, honey." Green, in her role as Aunt Jemima, made appearances at countless
                                    country fairs, flea markets, food shows, and local grocery stores. By the turn of
                                    the century, Aunt Jemima, along with the Armour meat chef, were the two commercial
                                    symbols most trusted by American housewives (Sacharow, 1982, p. 82). By 1910 more
                                    than 120 million Aunt Jemima breakfasts were being served annually. The popularity
                                    of Aunt Jemima inspired many giveaway and mail-in premiums, including, dolls, breakfast
                                    club pins, dishware, and recipe booklets.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>The R.T. Davis Mill Company was renamed the Aunt Jemima Mills Company in 1914, and
                                    eventually sold to the Quaker Oats Company in 1926. In 1933 Anna Robinson, who weighed
                                    350 pounds, became the second Aunt Jemima. She was much heavier and darker in complexion
                                    than was Nancy Green. The third Aunt Jemima was Edith Wilson, who is known primarily
                                    for playing the role of Aunt Jemima on radio and television shows between 1948 and
                                    1966. By the 1960s the Quaker Oats Company was the market leader in the frozen food
                                    business, and Aunt Jemima was an American icon. In recent years, Aunt Jemima has been
                                    given a makeover: her skin is lighter and the handkerchief has been removed from her
                                    head. She now has the appearance of an attractive maid -- not a Jim Crow era mammy.
