<span class="lmtitleunderline">Paging System</span>
<p class="small" align="justify">FLITE's public address system is used only to announce building closing times or to
make service announcements, such as weather-related warnings. FLITE does not provide paging services for non-emergency
situations. For emergency paging please contact the Ferris Department of Public Safety (FSU-DPS) at 591-5000, and explain the
nature of the emergency. If FSU-DPS confirms that an emergency exits and that paging is warranted, they will contact the FLITE staff
at the Check-Out Desk.</p>
