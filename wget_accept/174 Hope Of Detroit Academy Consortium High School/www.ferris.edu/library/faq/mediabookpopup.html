<span class="lmtitleunderline">FSU Media Self-Booking</span>
<p class="small" align="justify">The DVDs and VHS tapes formerly housed at Media Distribution are currently held in secure (e.g., non regular-circulating collection) areas of FLITE.  These items have been fully cataloged and can be self-booked for classroom use on our Online Catalog Booking Module.  Instructions on how to use the Booking Module are provided in a link below.  There is also a link to go directly to the portion of the catalog containing the records of the media.</p>
<p class="small" align="justify">You can pick up your items from the check-out desk in FLITE beginning approximately 24 hours before your class.</p>
