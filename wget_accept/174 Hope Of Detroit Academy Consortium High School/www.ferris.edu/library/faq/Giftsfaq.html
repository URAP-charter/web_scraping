donated may not  fit the needs of the library and, therefore may be disposed
of at the discretion  of the library. At the time of donation, you
must read and complete the donation form, which transfers the ownership of donations to the library. Items 
 we <strong>do not add</strong> to our collection include newspapers, old textbooks, 
 popular fiction, random issues of journals (except to fill  in missing issues),
duplicates of materials we already own and damaged  items.<br>
