<p class="small" align="justify">Unclaimed items found in FLITE may be turned in to FLITE personnel at the Check Out Desk on the first floor. Anyone seeking a 
lost item should inquire at the first floor Check Out Desk or call (231) 591-2669.</p>

<p class="small" align="justify">After a reasonable time, FLITE staff will call Public Safety when keys, purses, wallets and cell phones have been turned in. 
These items are eventually stored at the Public Safety Office and can be claimed there. Misplaced Ferris Bulldog ID cards are stored at the Student 
Services Center and can be claimed there. All other items will be held at the FLITE Check Out Desk until the end of the current semester. Computer media will be 
identified, if possible, and kept at the Check Out Desk. At the end of the semester, any unclaimed items will be disposed of appropriately.</p>
