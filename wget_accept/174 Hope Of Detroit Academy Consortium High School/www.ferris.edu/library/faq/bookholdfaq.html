<p class="small" align="justify">A patron may request an item that is currently signed out to another patron. To secure a hold, you can do it in two ways.</p>
<p class="small" align="justify">You can secure a hold on an item electronically through the online catalog system, by clicking on the Place Hold Button and typing 
in your library barcode number. Or, you can have someone at the circulation desk place a hold on the item.</p>
<p class="small" align="justify">You will be notified when the item is returned. When the materials are returned, they will be held at the check-out desk for one 
week. If they are not picked up at that time, the materials are reshelved.</p>
