<p class="small" align="justify">Refbase is an online research management tool that allows users to create personal bibliographic databases and use them for a variety of research activities. References are quickly and easily imported from text files or online databases and records can be formatted in hundreds of output styles from APA, MLA, Chicago etc.</p> 
<p class="small" align="justify">Users can automatically insert references from their database into their papers and generate formatted bibliographies and manuscripts in seconds.
RefBase does not require any special software, and once you’ve established an account, you can access your materials from anywhere with an internet connection. References can be exported to be compatible with EndNote, RefWorks and other bibliographic software systems. FLITE has replaced its RefWorks subscription based system with the open source RefBase on July 1, 2009.</p>
