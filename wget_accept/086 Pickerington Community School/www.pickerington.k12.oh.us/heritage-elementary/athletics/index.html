                GREAT Happens Here!<br />
<br />
Welcome to Heritage Elementary School!  We are so pleased to have you as part of our school family.  The Heritage Mission Statement is We Educate, We Encourage, We Empower. Leaders Today / Ready for Tomorrow.  The leadership culture has been implemented using The Leader In Me approach through FranklinCovey.  This approach is based on the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey and it establishes a school-wide culture that supports and lives out these habits.  The 7 Habits are a common language used by all staff and is integrated into everything we do.<br />
<br />
As these habits become part of your child’s character, you will see increased leadership skills, goal setting, problem-solving and relationship abilities.  These habits will positively impact your child’s education as well as provide them lifelong skills that will carry into adulthood.            </div>

                        <p>Heritage Elementary is proud to be a Leader In Me school. A large part of our success is due to our parents and community embracing the 7 Habits as well. For some of you this might be new and for many others a refresher. If you ever want to learn more about The Leader In Me or the 7 Habits, please give us a call and we will gladly get you more information. The 7 Habits are listed below and have become the norm of the Heritage Elementary school culture. Discussing the habits regularly and implementing them at home can make a big difference in your child.</p>
<ul>
<li>HABIT 1: Be Proactive</li>
</ul>
<p>I am a responsible person. I take initiative. I choose my actions, attitudes, and moods. I do not blame others for my wrong actions. I do the right thing without being asked, even when no one is looking.</p>
<ul>
<li>HABIT 2: Begin with the End in Mind</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan ahead and set goals. I do things that have meaning and make a difference. I am an important part of my classroom and contribute to my school’s mission and vision. I look for ways to be a good citizen.</p>
<ul>
<li>HABIT 3: Put First Things First</li>
</ul>
<p>I spend my time on things that are most important. This means I say no to things I know I should not do. I set priorities, make a schedule, and follow my plan. I am disciplined and organized.</p>
<ul>
<li>HABIT 4: Think Win-Win</li>
</ul>
<p>I balance courage for getting what I want with consideration for what others want. When conflicts arise, I look for a win-win solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>HABIT 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood</li>
</ul>
<p>I listen to other people’s ideas and feelings. I try to see things from their viewpoint (paradigm). I listen to others without interrupting. I listen with my ears, my eyes, and my heart. I am confident in voicing my ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>HABIT 6: Synergize</li>
</ul>
<p>I value other people’s strengths and learn from them. I get along well with others, even people who are different than me. I work well in groups. I seek out other people’s ideas because I know that by teaming with others, we can create better solutions than what any one of us could alone. I look for Third Alternatives.</p>
<ul>
<li>HABIT 7: Sharpen the Saw</li>
</ul>
<p>I eat right, exercise, and get enough sleep (body). I learn in lots of places, not just at school (brain). I spend time with family and friends (heart). I take time to find meaningful ways to help people (soul). I balance all four parts of myself.</p>
