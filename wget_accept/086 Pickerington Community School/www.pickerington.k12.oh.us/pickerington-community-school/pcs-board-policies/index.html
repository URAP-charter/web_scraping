<p><strong>ADMINISTERING MEDICINES TO STUDENTS</strong></p>
<p>Many students are able to attend school regularly only through effective use of medication in the treatment of disabilities or illnesses that do not hinder the health or welfare of others.  If possible, all medication should be given by the parent(s) at home.  If this is not possible, it is done in compliance with the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>The following individuals can administer prescription drugs to students:
<ol>
<li>Employees of the Board who are licensed health professionals;</li>
<li>Approved Volunteers who are licensed health professionals; or</li>
<li>Employees who are appointed by the Board and who have completed a drug administration training program conducted by a licensed health professional and considered appropriate by the Board.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The school nurse or an appropriate person appointed by the Board supervises the secure and proper storage and dispensation of medications.  The drug must be received in the container in which it was dispensed by the prescribing physician or others licensed to prescribe medication.</li>
<li>Written permission must be received from the parent(s) of the student, requesting that the school nurse or an appropriate person comply with the physician’s order.</li>
<li>The school nurse or other designated individual must receive and retain a statement which complies with State law and is signed by the physician who prescribed the drug or other person licensed to prescribe medication.</li>
<li>The parent(s) must agree to submit a revised statement, signed by the physician or other licensed individual who prescribed the drug, to the nurse or other designated individual if any of the information originally provided by the physician or licensed individual changes.</li>
<li>No employee who is authorized by the Board to administer a prescribed drug and who has a copy of the most recent statement is liable in civil damages for administering or failing to administer the drug, unless he/she acts in a manner which would constitute “gross negligence or wanton or reckless misconduct.”</li>
<li>No person employed by the Board is required to administer a drug to a student except pursuant to requirements established under this policy.  The Board shall not require an employee to administer a drug to a student if the employee objects, on the basis of religious convictions, to administering the drug.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Inhalers for Asthma</u></p>
<p>Students have the right to possess and use a metered-dose inhaler or a dry-powder inhaler to alleviate asthmatic symptoms or before exercise to prevent the onset of asthmatic symptoms.  The right applies at school or at any activity, event or program sponsored by or in which the student&#8217;s school is a participant.</p>
<p>In order for a student to possess the inhaler, he/she must have written approval from the student’s physician and parent or other caretaker.  The principal and/or the school nurse must have received copies of these required written approvals.</p>
<p><u>Epinephrine Autoinjectors </u></p>
<p>Students are permitted to carry and use an epinephrine autoinjector (epi-pen) to treat anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions).  The right to carry and use an epi-pen extends to any activity, event or program sponsored by the student’s school or activity, event or program in which the school participates.</p>
<p>Student possession of an epi-pen is permitted only if the student has written approval from the prescriber of the medication and, if a minor, from his/her parent.  Written approval must be on file with the principal and, if one is assigned, the school nurse.  In addition, the principal or school nurse must receive a backup dose of the medication from the parent or student.</p>
<p><u>Staff</u></p>
<p>The Pickerington Community School Governing board approves all qualified Pickerington Local School employees who meet the requirements of this policy to administer medications to PCS students.</p>

<p><strong>ADMINISTERING MEDICINES TO STUDENTS (General Regulations)</strong></p>
<p>Students needing medication are encouraged to receive the medication at home, if possible.</p>
<p>Only employees of the Board who are licensed health professionals, or who are appointed by the Board and have completed a drug administration training program conducted by a licensed health professional and considered appropriate by the Board, can administer prescription drugs to students.</p>
<ol>
<li>The person or persons designated to administer medication receives a written request, signed by the parent(s) having care or charge of the student, that the drug be administered to the student.</li>
<li>Each person designated to administer medication receives a statement, signed by the physician or other person licensed to prescribe medication, which includes all of the following information:
<ol>
<li>the name and address of the student;</li>
<li>the school and class in which the student is enrolled;</li>
<li>the name of the drug and the dosage to be administered;</li>
<li>the times or intervals at which each dosage of the drug is to be administered;</li>
<li>the date on which the administration of the drug is to begin;</li>
<li>the date on which the administration of the drug is to cease;</li>
<li>any severe adverse reactions which should be reported to the physician and one or more telephone numbers at which the person who prescribed the medication can be reached in case of an emergency and</li>
<li>special instructions for administration of the drug, including sterile conditions and storage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The parent(s) agree to submit a revised statement signed by the physician who prescribed the drug to the person designated to administer medication if any of the information provided by the person licensed to prescribe medication as described above changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The person authorized to administer the drug receives a copy of the statement described above.</p>
<ol>
<li>The drug is received by the person authorized to administer the drug to the student for whom the drug is prescribed in the container in which it was dispensed by the prescribing physician or other licensed professional.</li>
<li>The person designated by the Board establishes a location in each school building for the storage of drugs to be administered.  All such drugs shall be stored in that location in a locked storage place.  Drugs which require refrigeration may be kept in a refrigerator in a place not commonly used by students.</li>
</ol>
<p>No person who has been authorized by the Board to administer a drug and has a copy of the most recent statement which was given to him/her prior to administering the drug is liable for administering or failing to administer the drug, unless such person acts in a manner which constitutes gross negligence or wanton or reckless misconduct.</p>
<p>A person employed by the Board is not required to administer a prescribed drug to a student unless a Board regulation establishes a requirement; furthermore, the Board shall not require an employee to administer a drug to a student if the employee objects, on the basis of religious convictions, to administering the drug.</p>
<p>Board policy and regulations regarding dispensation of medication must be formally adopted by the Board and may be changed, modified or revised only by action of the Board.</p>
<p>The Pickerington Community School Governing Board approves all qualified Pickerington Local School employees who meet the requirements of this policy to administer medications to PCS students.</p>

<p>Student possession of an epi-pen is permitted only if the student has written approval from the prescriber of the medication and from his/her parent.  Written approval must be on file with the principal and, if one is assigned, the school nurse.  In addition, the principal or school nurse must receive a backup dose of the medication from the parent or student.</p>
<p>The prescriber’s written approval must specify at least the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>the student&#8217;s name and address;</li>
<li>the name of the medication contained in the autoinjector;</li>
<li>the date the administration of the medication is to begin;</li>
<li>the date, if known, that the administration of the medication is to cease;</li>
<li>circumstances in which the epi-pen should be used;</li>
<li>written instructions that outline procedures school personnel should follow if the student is unable to administer the medication or the medication does not produce the expected relief from the student’s anaphylaxis (allergic response);</li>
<li>any severe reaction that;
<ol>
<li>the student may experience that should be reported to the prescriber or</li>
<li>that may occur to another student for whom the medication is not prescribed, if that student receives a dose of the medication;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>at least one emergency telephone number each for contacting the prescriber and the parent and;</li>
<li>any other special instructions from the prescriber.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever a student is administered epinephrine at school or at an activity, event or program sponsored by the school or in which the school is a participant, a school employee must immediately request assistance from an emergency medical service provider.  Request for medical assistance applies whether the student self-administers the medication or a school employee administers it to the student.</p>
<p>The Board and District employees are not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death or loss to person or property allegedly arising if:</p>
<ol>
<li>a school employee prohibits a student from using an epi-pen because he/she has a good faith belief that the conditions for carrying and using the medication have not been satisfied;</li>
<li>a school employee permits a student to carry and use an epi-pen because of the good faith that the conditions have been satisfied; or</li>
<li>in instances in which a student is rightfully permitted to carry an epi-pen, the medication is used by a student for whom it was not prescribed.</li>
</ol>
<p>All immunities granted to schools under the sovereign immunity law or any other law apply.</p>

<p><strong>BLOODBORNE</strong> <strong>PATHOGENS</strong></p>
<p>The Governing Board recognizes that staff/students incur some risk of infection and illness each time they are exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials. While the risk to staff/students of exposure to body fluids due to casual contact with individuals in the school environment is extremely low, the Board regards any such risk as serious.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Board directs adherence to universal precautions which require that staff and students approach infection control as if all direct contact with human blood and body fluids is known to be infectious for HIV, HBV and/or other blood-borne pathogens. Blood-borne pathogens are pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human blood and other body fluids and can cause disease in humans.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the risk to staff/students by minimizing or eliminating staff exposure incidents to blood-borne pathogens, the Board directs the Superintendent to develop and implement an Exposure Control Plan.</p>
<p>The plan shall include training followed by an offer of immunization with Hepatitis B vaccine for all staff who are required to provide first aid to students and/or staff and/or for all staff who have occupational exposure and are determined to be at risk by the PCS.</p>
<p>Note: Subcontractors are not covered under this policy.</p>

<p><strong>BLOODBORNE</strong> <strong>PATHOGENS</strong></p>
<p>PCS is committed to the health and safety of staff, students and visitors.  To help meet this commitment, PCS has developed this Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Program.  This program is intended to eliminate or minimize employee occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials or body fluids, thereby preventing the transmission of bloodborne diseases to employees in the workplace.  This program also serves to meet the requirements of OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.1030.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p><em>Bloodborne Pathogens:</em>  Microorganisms and viruses in infected human blood that can cause diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV).</p>
<p><em>Sharps:</em>  Any sharp object that can penetrate the skin.</p>
<p><em>Universal Precautions:</em>  Assuming all blood and body fluids to be potentially infectious, and taking appropriate protective measures to prevent exposure.</p>
<p><em>Work practice controls</em>:  Methods in which tasks are performed that reduce the likelihood of exposure to blood, body fluids or other potentially infectious materials.</p>
<p>Responsibilities:</p>
<p>The<u> School Health Supervisor</u> is responsible for coordinating the implementation and management of the PCS Bloodborne Pathogens Program.</p>
<p>This includes coordination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supplies such as personal protective equipment (glove kits)</li>
<li>Hepatitis B Vaccines</li>
<li>Training</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Principals, Managers &amp; Supervisors </u><br />
The school principals are responsible for implementing, maintaining, and enforcing all aspects of the district safety programs within the schools.</p>
<p><u>Managers and supervisors</u> are responsible for the safety of all personnel under their direction and control, and ensuring they with comply the provisions of this program.</p>
<p><u>All Employees</u> of PLSD/PCS are expected to familiarize themselves with, and abide by, the precautions and provisions of this Bloodborne Pathogens Program.</p>
<p>Details and Procedures:</p>
<p>PCS has identified job classifications of district employees that may place the employee at increased risk of occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials.</p>
<p>These employees are identified as Group 1:</p>
<p><u>Staff Member / Additional Information</u></p>
<p><em>Principals and Assistant Principals</em> / If involved in school discipline<br />
<em>School Nurses</em><br />
<em>Health Assistants</em><br />
<em>Special Education Teachers and Paraprofessionals</em> / If dealing with students with students who cannot control their body fluids or cannot control their behaviors<br />
<em>Coaches</em><br />
<em>Athletic Trainers</em><br />
<em>Secretaries and Office Assistants</em> / If assigned to provide student first aid in school clinic<br />
<em>Custodians</em></p>
<p>All other school district job classifications not listed in Group 1 are identified as Group 2.  These employees may have occupational exposure, however, these job types are determined not to be at high risk.</p>
<p><u>Universal Precautions</u></p>
<p>Universal Precautions will be observed by all employees in order to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials.  All blood or other potentially infectious materials will be considered infectious, even if it is difficult or impossible to differentiate among body fluid types, regardless of the perceived status of the individual.</p>
<p>Standard practices are to be followed by all employees as follows:</p>
<p>Safety Procedures (Work Practice Controls)</p>
<p><u>Standard Practices</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Wash hands or other exposed skin with soap and running water as soon as possible after any possible contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials from an injured person.</li>
<li>Wear disposable gloves when anticipating contact with blood, body fluids, mucous membranes, other potentially infectious materials and/or contaminated surfaces.</li>
<li>Wash hands immediately after removal of gloves or other personal protective equipment.  Note, because most district buildings are public access, they will have available hand washing facilities in public restrooms or custodial closets.  If hand washing is not readily accessible, wipe hands with antiseptic towelette, then wash hands with soap and water as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Wear mask, eye protection, and/or a gown if fluid splattering is likely to occur when caring for an injured person.</li>
<li>Handle sharp objects carefully.</li>
<li>Needles or other sharp objects should not be bent, recapped or moved. All sharps will be disposed of in a red sharps container.</li>
<li>Broken glassware that may be contaminated is not picked up directly with the hands, but is picked up using appropriate hand protection and tools.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Athletic Safety Practices</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Open wounds must be covered before practicing or competing.</li>
<li>Athletes should render first aid to themselves or cover their own wounds whenever possible.</li>
<li>When rendering first aid to others, wear protective gloves any time blood, open wounds, or mucous membranes may be involved.  Dispose of the gloves and use clean gloves for each person.</li>
<li>If you get someone else’s blood on yourself, wear protective gloves and wipe it off with a disposable towel using antibacterial soap and water.</li>
<li>If blood is present during practice or competition, play should be stopped to allow any contaminated surface to be cleaned with the appropriate disinfectant by someone using protective gloves.</li>
<li>If clothes are contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials, they must be changed before resuming athletic involvement.</li>
<li>Do not use common towels to clean blood off any contaminated surface.  The use of common towels at any time during athletics should be discouraged.</li>
<li>In general, use good hygienic practices.  Avoid the sharing of towels, cups, and water bottles.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Cleaning and Disinfecting</u></p>
<ul>
<li>All spills, contamination, and surfaces exposed to blood, body fluids or other potentially infectious materials must be immediately contained and cleaned by employees trained and equipped to work with potentially infectious materials.</li>
<li>All surfaces exposed to blood, body fluids or other potentially infectious materials shall be wiped clean and appropriately disinfected using a 1:10 bleach solution or other EPA registered disinfectant.</li>
<li>Clean up kits shall be used to clean items or equipment and surfaces that are exposed to blood, body fluids or other potentially infectious materials.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Personal Protective Equipment</u></p>
<p>PCS will provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to employees, including gowns, eye protection, disposable and non-disposable masks, face shields, and gowns, at no cost to employees.</p>
<p>Personal protective equipment is considered appropriate only if it does not permit blood or other potentially infectious materials to pass through to reach the employee’s clothes, skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes under normal conditions of use.  Appropriate protective clothing shall be worn in occupational exposure situations.  The type and characteristic will depend on the task, location, and degree of exposure anticipated.</p>
<p><u>Gloves</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Gloves shall be worn when it is anticipated that the employee may have contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin as well as when handling or touching contaminated items or work surfaces.</li>
<li>Disposable gloves shall be replaced as soon as possible when they are contaminated, torn, punctured, or are not an adequate barrier.</li>
<li>Disposable gloves shall not be washed or decontaminated for reuse. Utility gloves may be decontaminated for reuse if the integrity of the gloves is not compromised.  They must be discarded if they are cracked, torn, peeling, punctured or show signs of deterioration.</li>
<li>Hypoallergenic gloves, glove liners, powderless gloves, or similar alternatives shall be available for employees requiring them.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Masks and Eye Protection</u></p>
<p>Masks, in combination with eye protection devices such as goggles or glasses with solid side shields, shall be worn whenever splashes sprays or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious materials are present and eye, nose, or mouth contamination may be anticipated.</p>
<p><u>Garments</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Appropriate protective clothing includes gowns, aprons, lab coats or similar outer garments that are worn in occupational exposure situations.  The type and characteristics of such protective clothing must be appropriate to the task and degree of exposure anticipated.</li>
<li>Remove garments that become penetrated with blood or other potentially infectious material immediately or as soon as feasible.</li>
<li>Replace all garments that are torn or punctured, or that lose their ability to function as a barrier to bloodborne pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an employee declines to use PPE because in his or her own judgment of a particular situation, it would pose an increased hazard to the employee or others, the district shall investigate and document the circumstances to determine whether changes need to be instituted to prevent such occurrences in the future.</p>
<p><u>Housekeeping:</u></p>
<p>The district will work to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worksites are maintained in a clean and sanitary condition.</li>
<li>All equipment, environmental areas and working surfaces are cleaned and decontaminated by trained staff after contact with blood, body fluids or other potentially infectious materials.</li>
<li>All contaminated surfaces are decontaminated with an appropriate disinfectant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hepatitis B Vaccine:</p>
<p><u>Pre-Exposure Vaccination</u></p>
<p>School district employees whose job classifications are outlined in Group 1 will be offered the vaccine.  The vaccine will be offered within ten (10) working days of the initial job assignment, unless the employee has previously had the vaccine or wishes to submit results of antibody testing verifying sufficient immunity.  Employees who agree to receive the Hepatitis B Vaccine will sign a Hepatitis B Vaccine consent form.  Employees who decline the vaccine will be requested to sign a waiver.  Such employees may change their mind at any future time and request immunization, which will be given at no cost to the employee.</p>
<p>Any employee in Group 2 may appeal for immunization due to unique circumstances of their individual job duties by completing the Hepatitis B Vaccination Appeal form.  The school district will assure that, when deemed appropriate, the vaccine is offered.</p>
<p><u>Post-Exposure Vaccination</u></p>
<p>The Hepatitis B vaccine will be offered to employees in Group 2 who have been potentially exposed to someone’s blood or body fluids.  Employees having an exposure incident who decline the Hepatitis B vaccine will be required to sign a waiver.  Employees who initially decline the vaccine but who later wish to have it, will receive the vaccine at no cost.</p>
<p><u>Post-Exposure Procedures</u></p>
<p>All exposure incidents shall be reported, investigated, and documented. When an employee incurs an exposure incident, it shall be reported immediately to their supervisor.</p>

<p><strong>BULLYING AND HAZING (Harassment, Intimidation and Dating Violence)</strong></p>
<p>Bullying is an intentional written, verbal, electronic or physical act that a student has exhibited more than once toward a student or students. The behavior causes mental or physical harm to the other student and is sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive that it creates an intimidating, threatening or abusive educational environment for others.</p>
<p>Throughout board policy and regulations, the term bullying is used to mean harassment, intimidation and bullying.</p>
<p>Hazing means doing any act or coercing another, including the victim, to do any act of intimidation or harassment to any student or other organization that causes or creates a substantial risk of causing mental or physical harm to any person.</p>
<p>Prohibited activities of any type, including those activities engaged in via computer and/or electronic communications devices or electronic means, are inconsistent with the educational process and are prohibited at all times including on school property, on a school bus or at a school-sponsored activity. Students found responsible for harassment, intimidation or bullying by an electronic act may be suspended.</p>
<p>No administrator, teacher or other employee of PCS shall encourage, permit, condone or tolerate any hazing and/or bullying activities. No students, including leaders of student organizations, are permitted to plan, encourage or engage in any hazing and/or bullying. Permission, consent or assumption of risk by an individual subjected to hazing, bullying and/or dating violence does not lessen the prohibition contained in this policy.</p>
<p>PCS includes, within the health curriculum, age-appropriate instruction in dating violence prevention education in grades 9 to 12. This instruction includes recognizing warning signs of dating violence and the characteristics of healthy relationships.</p>
<p>Administrators, teachers and all other PCS employees are particularly alert to possible conditions, circumstances or events that might include hazing, bullying and/or dating violence. If hazing and/or bullying or planned hazing and/or bullying is discovered, involved students are informed by the discovering PCS employee of the prohibition contained in this policy and are required to end all hazing and/or bullying activities immediately. All hazing and/or bullying incidents are reported immediately to the Superintendent and appropriate discipline is administered.</p>
<p>The Superintendent/designee must provide the Board President with a semiannual written report summary of all verified reported incidents of hazing and/or bullying and post the report summary on the school’s website, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>The administration provides training on the school&#8217;s hazing and bullying policy to PCS employees and volunteers who have direct contact with students. Additional training is provided to elementary employees in violence and substance abuse prevention and positive youth development.</p>
<p>PCS employees, students and volunteers have qualified civil immunity for damages arising from reporting an incident of hazing and/or bullying. Administrators, teachers, other employees and students who fail to abide by this policy may be subject to disciplinary action and may be liable for civil and criminal penalties in compliance with State and Federal law.</p>
<p>No one is permitted to retaliate against an employee or student because he/she files a grievance or assists or participates in an investigation, proceeding or hearing regarding the charge of hazing and/or bullying of an individual.</p>

<p><strong>ADOPTION DATE:<br />

<p><strong>BULLYING AND HAZING (Harassment, Intimidation and Dating Violence)</strong></p>
<p>The prohibition against hazing, harassment, intimidation, bullying or dating violence is publicized in student handbooks and in the publications that set the standard of conduct for schools and students at Pickerington Community School (PCS). In addition, information regarding the policy is incorporated into employee handbooks and training materials.</p>
<p><u>School Personnel Responsibilities and Complaint Procedures</u></p>
<p>Harassing, hazing, intimidating, bullying and/or dating violence behavior by any student/school personnel at PCS is strictly prohibited, and such conduct may result in disciplinary action, including suspension and/or expulsion from school.  Harassment, hazing, intimidation, bullying and/or dating violence means any intentional written, verbal, electronic, graphic or physical acts, including electronically transmitted acts, either overt or covert, by a student or group of students toward other students/school personnel with the intent to haze, harass, intimidate, injure, threaten, ridicule or humiliate.  Such behaviors are prohibited on or immediately adjacent to school grounds, at any school-sponsored activity; in any PCS publication; through the use of any PCS-owned or operated communication tools, including but not limited to PCS/PLSD e-mail accounts and/or computers; on school-provided transportation or at any official school bus stop.</p>
<p>Hazing, harassment, intimidation, bullying or dating violence can include many different behaviors.  Examples of conduct that could constitute prohibited behaviors include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>physical violence and/or attacks;</li>
<li>threats, taunts and intimidation through words and/or gestures;</li>
<li>extortion, damage or stealing of money and/or possessions;</li>
<li>exclusion from the peer group or spreading rumors;</li>
<li>repetitive and hostile behavior with the intent to harm others through the use of information and communication technologies and other web-based/online sites (also known as “cyber bullying”), such as the following:
<ol>
<li>posting slurs on web sites, social networking sites, blogs or personal online journals;</li>
<li>sending abusive or threatening e-mails, web site postings or comments and instant messages;</li>
<li>using camera phones to take embarrassing photographs or videos of students and/or distributing or posting the photos or videos online and</li>
<li>using web sites, social networking sites, blogs or personal online journals, e-mails or instant messages to circulate gossip and rumors to other students.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>excluding others from an online group by falsely reporting them for inappropriate language to Internet service providers.</li>
</ol>
<p>In evaluating whether conduct constitutes hazing or bullying, special attention is paid to the words chosen or the actions taken, whether such conduct occurred in front of others or was communicated to others, how the perpetrator interacted with the victim and the motivation, either admitted or appropriately inferred.</p>
<p><u>Teachers and Other School Staff</u></p>
<p>Teachers and other school staff who witness acts of harassment, hazing, intimidation and/or bullying, as defined above, promptly notify the building principal/designee of the event observed, and promptly file a written incident report concerning the events witnessed.</p>
<p>A. <u>Investigation</u></p>
<p>The administrator/designee is notified of any formal or informal complaint of suspected harassment, hazing, intimidation or bullying.  Under the direction of the building principal/designee, all such complaints are investigated promptly.  A written report of the investigation is prepared when the investigation is complete. The report includes findings of fact, a determination of whether acts of harassment, hazing, intimidation, bullying and/or dating violence were verified, and when prohibited acts are verified, a recommendation for intervention, including disciplinary action, is included in the report.  Where appropriate, written witness statements are attached to the report.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, when a student making an informal complaint has requested anonymity, the investigation of such complaint is limited as is appropriate in view of the anonymity of the complaint.  Such limitation of the investigation may include restricting action to a simple review of the complaint (with or without discussing it with the alleged perpetrator), subject to receipt of further information and/or the withdrawal by the complaining student of the condition that his/her report be anonymous.</p>
<p>B. <u>Nondisciplinary Interventions</u></p>
<p>When verified acts of harassment, hazing, intimidation, bullying and/or dating violence are identified early and/or when such verified acts do not reasonably require a disciplinary response, students may be counseled as to the definition of the behavior, its prohibition and their duty to avoid any conduct that could be considered harassing, hazing, intimidating, bullying and/or dating violence.</p>
<p>C. <u>Disciplinary Interventions</u></p>
<p>When acts of harassment, intimidation and bullying are verified and a disciplinary response is warranted, students are subject to the full range of disciplinary consequences.  Anonymous complaints that are not otherwise verified, however, cannot provide the basis for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Allegations of criminal misconduct are reported to law enforcement, and suspected child abuse is reported to Child Protective Services, per required timelines.</p>
<p><u>Report to the Parent or Guardian of the Perpetrator</u></p>
<p>If after investigation, acts of harassment, intimidation and bullying by a specific student are verified, the building administrator/designee notifies the parent or guardian of the perpetrator, in writing, of that finding.  If disciplinary consequences are imposed against such student, a description of such discipline is included in such notification.</p>
<p><u>Reports to the Victim and His/Her Parent or Guardian</u></p>
<p>If after investigation, acts of bullying or hazing against a specific student are verified, the building administrator/designee notifies the parent/guardian of the victim of the finding.  In providing such notification, care must be taken to respect the statutory privacy rights of the perpetrator.</p>
<p>Bullying matters, including the identity of both the charging party and the accused, are kept confidential to the extent possible.  Although discipline may be imposed against the accused upon a finding of guilt, retaliation is prohibited.</p>
<p><u>Police and Child Protective Services</u></p>
<p>In addition to, or instead of, filing a complaint through this policy, a complainant may choose to exercise other options including, but not limited to, filing a complaint with outside agencies or filing a private lawsuit.  Nothing prohibits a complainant from seeking redress under any other provision of the State law or common law that may apply.</p>
<p>PCS must also investigate incidents of harassment, hazing, intimidation and/or bullying for the purpose of determining whether there has been a violation of the policy or regulations, even if law enforcement and/or the public children’s services are also investigating.</p>
<p>All PCS/PLSD personnel must cooperate with investigations by outside agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Career Advising Policy</strong></p>
<p>The PCS Governing Board recognizes career advising as an important function of schools.  Career advising is an integrated process that helps students understand how their personal interests, strengths and values predict satisfaction and success in school and careers, and how to tie these interests and strengths to their academic and career goals.</p>

<ol>
<li>Grade level career development goals and activities.</li>
<li>Career advising resources and tools for teachers, parents and students.</li>

</ol>
<ol>
<li>Identifying students who are at risk of dropping out of school using a local, research-based method with input from teachers, school counselors and other appropriate school staff.</li>

<p><strong>COLLEGE CREDIT PLUS (Regulations)</strong></p>
<p>Pickerington Community School (PCS) will participate in the College Credit Plus Program (CCP) for the purpose of promoting rigorous academic pursuits and exposing students to options beyond the high school classroom.</p>
<ol>
<li>Information Requirement
<ol>
<li>Prior to March 1 of each school year, all students enrolled in grades 6 through 11, and their parents will receive notification of the College Credit Plus Program and the options available to them. This information shall be offered to all students attending Eastland-Fairfield Career Center or one of their satellite programs. The district will provide multiple forms of communication to parents and students including parent notification systems, the district website, and information available through school counselors and administrators.</li>
<li>By April 1, annually, students and their parents must submit appropriate intent to participate forms to the Pickerington High School Counselors Office. Students who do not submit the intent to participate form by the April 1 deadline must secure written permission from the principal to participate in the CCP program.</li>
<li>The PLS District holds an information session annually in partnership with participating colleges and universities within 30 miles. This session includes information about benefits and consequences of participation in CCP, and outlines any changes or additions to program requirements.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Program Eligibility and CounselingThe District provides counseling services to students prior to participation in CCP including:a. information pertaining to eligibility,<br />
b. financial obligations,<br />
c. support services,<br />
d. transportation,<br />
e. scheduling,<br />
f. the effect of grades attained on the student’s grade point average,<br />
g. consequences of failing or not completing a course, including the effect on high school graduation,<br />
h. benefits of the program to the student, including the reduction of cost and time required to complete a college education,<br />
i. academic and social responsibilities of students and parents participating in the program,<br />
j. information about college counseling services, and<br />
k. the process of granting academic credits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pickerington Local Schools offers a 15-credit hour and a 30-credit hour model course pathway for courses offered under CCP.  Each pathway includes courses, which once completed, apply to at least one degree or professional certification offered at the college.  The pathways are organized by desired major or career path, and include various core courses required for a degree or professional certification by the college. No participant is required to enroll only in courses included in a model pathway.</p>
<p>PCS’ grading policy awards grades and calculates class standing for CCP courses in a manner equivalent to other advanced standing programs.</p>
<p><u>Student Enrollment</u></p>
<p>To participate in CCP, a student must apply to, and be accepted by, a participating college in accordance with the college’s established procedures for admission.  The student also must meet the college’s established standards for admission and course placement, including any course specific capacity limits.  The student and his/her parent also must sign a form acknowledging receipt of the required counseling and understanding of their responsibilities under the program.</p>
<p>The student may opt to receive college credit only or both college and high school credit.  The student must designate his/her choice at the time of enrollment.</p>
<p>If a student completes a college course, the Board shall award him/her appropriate credit toward high school graduation if, at the time of enrollment, he/she elects to receive credit for courses toward fulfilling the graduation requirements.</p>
<p>High school credit awarded for courses successfully completed counts toward graduation requirements and subject area requirements.</p>
<p>The Board awards comparable credit for the course/courses completed at the college.</p>
<p>If no comparable course is offered, the Board grants an appropriate number of elective credits.</p>
<p>Any disputes between the student and the Board regarding high school credits granted for a course may be appealed by the student to the State Board of Education.  The State Board’s decision on these matters is final.</p>
<p>The student’s transcript will reflect evidence of successful completion of each course and the high school credits awarded.  The transcript will indicate that the credits were earned as a participant in CCP, and include the name of the college at which the credits were earned.</p>
<p><u>High School/College Enrollment</u></p>
<p>A student who enrolls in CCP for the first time in:</p>
<p>Grades 7, 8 or 9 may receive credit toward high school graduation for up to the equivalent of four academic school years.</p>
<p>10th grade may receive credit toward high school graduation for up to the equivalent of three academic school years.</p>
<p>11th grade may receive credit toward high school graduation for up to the equivalent of two academic school years.</p>
<p>12th grade may receive credit for up to the equivalent of one academic school year.</p>
<p>Proportionate reductions are made for any student who enrolls in the program during the course of a school year.</p>
<p>The maximum number of credits that may be earned during the academic year is the total of the high school courses and college courses.  The total may not exceed 30 college credit hours per academic year.</p>
<p>College courses for which three-semester hours are earned are awarded one credit toward high school graduation credit.  Fractional credits are awarded proportionally.</p>
<p><u>Financial Responsibilities</u></p>
<ol>
<li>If a student elects to enroll for college credit only (Option A), the student is responsible for all costs associated with the course.</li>
<li>If a student elects to enroll for the combination high school/college credit (Option B), PCS is responsible for all costs associated with the course at a public college/university.  Students participating in CCP under Option B at a private college shall be charged tuition and/or fees unless they are economically disadvantaged.</li>
<li>If a student fails a CCP course, the student or parent(s) may be responsible for all costs associated with the course.  The District may not seek reimbursement from a student who fails a course if he/she is economically disadvantaged. Any student who has been expelled and fails a course shall be responsible for all costs associated with this course.</li>
<li>Students enrolled for the combination of high school/college credit are not eligible for financial aid from the college.</li>
<li>Upon parental application and determination of need, an eligible student, as defined by State law, enrolling for the combination of high school and college credit in the program may receive full or partial reimbursement for the necessary costs of transportation between the secondary school that he/she attends and the college/university in which he/she is enrolled.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Other Considerations</u></p>
<ol>
<li>A student enrolled in the program follows the District attendance policy, as well as the District code of conduct, for curricular and extracurricular activities.  These policies and codes are applicable during the time the student is attending high school and is on school property for any class or activity.</li>
<li>If a student is expelled from the District, the Board will deny high school credit for college courses taken during the period of the student’s expulsion. The Superintendent will send written notice of a student’s expulsion to the college where the student is taking courses to receive high school credit.  The notice must state the date the expulsion is scheduled to expire and whether the Board has denied high school credit for college courses taken during the expulsion.  If the expulsion period is extended, the Superintendent must notify the college of the extension.  The college may withdraw its acceptance of a student who has been expelled.  Unless otherwise authorized by State law, the expelled student is ineligible to enroll in a college under CCP for subsequent college terms during the expulsion period.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Students enrolled in this program must recognize potential schedule conflicts between high school and CCP courses offered at a participating college or university.</li>
<li>The District adheres to the Ohio High School Athletic Association for eligibility to participate in athletics.  In order to be eligible, the student must have passed five courses that count toward graduation during the prior grading period.  The five courses may be a combination of high school and college courses.  Students also must meet any additional District eligibility requirements.</li>
<li>The parents and/or the student assume all responsibility and liability for student’s actions and safety while involved in any part of the College Credit Plus Program. This responsibility includes travel to and from college, time in college attendance, and all other times that the student is not required to be present at a Pickerington High School.</li>

<p><strong>CREDIT FLEXIBILITY<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The Governing Board recognizes that an effective educational program is one that provides opportunities for students to customize aspects of their learning around their respective needs and interests.  Credit flexibility is one method to motivate and increase student learning by allowing access to more resources, customization around individual student needs and the use of multiple measures of learning.  Credit flexibility shifts the focus from &#8220;seat time&#8221; to performance.  Students can earn units of high school credit based on an individually approved credit flexibility plan. The intent of credit flexibility is to meet increased expectations for high school graduation in response to globalization, technology and demographics, and to meet the demand for the 21st century skills.</p>
<p>In accordance with State law, the School must develop and implement a credit flexibility plan that enables students to earn high school credit by:</p>
<p>1. completing coursework;</p>
<p>2. testing out or showing mastery of course content;</p>
<p>3. pursuing an educational option and/or an individually approved option; and/or</p>
<p>4. any combination of the above.</p>

<p><strong>CREDIT FLEXIBILITY<br />
</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with State law, the School&#8217;s plan for credit flexibility must:</p>
<p>1. identify the multiple methods of communication and frequency of each method the School will use to communicate the aspects of the credit flexibility policy and plan to studens and parents on an on-going basis;</p>
<p>2. allow for demonstrated proficiency options on an on-going basis;</p>
<p>3. allow for graded options for demonstrated proficiency;</p>
<p>4. allow demonstration of proficiency to count towards course requirements for graduation;</p>
<p>5. determine credit equivalency for a Carnegie unit;</p>
<p>6. prohibit capping or limiting the number of courses or credits earned through credit flexibility;</p>
<p>7. allow for both simultaneous credit and/or partial credit to be earned;</p>
<p>8. not prohibit access to online education, postsecondary options or services from another district or school, as approved by the Board;</p>
<p>9. allow, if so desired, for the acceptance of credit from other districts and educational providers:</p>
<p>10. establish provisions for instances when students do not or cannot complete requirements; and</p>
<p>11. establish a review process and submit data to the Ohio Department of Education about the methods and frequency of communications with students and parents.</p>
<p>Students may access high school credit by demonstrating course mastery through course proficiency/test out or though an educational option such as an online course, service learning project or internship.  the Governing Board maintains all credit flexibility applications and materials on its website.  The student&#8217;s school counselor is the point of contact for initiating the process.  The superintendent or designee shall establish annual deadlines for application submissions.</p>
<p>In addition, the Superintendent/designee collects performance data including, but not limited to, the number of participating students, total credits earned and extent to which student participation reflects diversity of the student body.</p>
<p>The Ohio Department of Education recommends that the Superintendent maintain a &#8220;library&#8221; of course that were previously accepted to assist students, parents and teachers with understanding available options (or those unique to local contexts and regional economic development interests).</p>

</strong></p>
<p>The Board acknowledges that most students derive the maximum scholastic and social benefits from a four-year high school program.  However, students who accelerate through the School&#8217;s academic program and complete the requirements of the Ohio Department of Education are permitted to graduate early.</p>
<p>Early graduation is available to high school students provided they follow all of the requirements established for this purpose.</p>
<p>Once approval for early graduation is established, the student becomes a member of the class in the school year in which his/her graduation requirements are completed.  The diploma may be given after the completion of all requirements at the next graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>All students&#8217; academic programs will be guided by an individual Graduation and Career Plan culminating in the passage of all required state assessments.  A yearly schedule of coursework will be part of the IGCP along with a timeframe for completion.  The IGCP will be reviewed annually with the student to determine if any changes need to be made.</p>

<p><strong>EVALUATION OF CERTIFICATED STAFF (Teacher Evaluation Policy)</strong></p>
<p>The Board of Education for Pickerington Local Schools and the Pickerington Community School Governing Board adopts the following teacher evaluation policy in accordance with the standards-based statewide teacher evaluation framework adopted by the State Board of Education in November 2011. The Board acknowledges that this teacher evaluation policy aligns with the <em>Standards for the Teaching Profession</em> as set forth in State law.</p>
<p>The Board directs the Superintendent to implement this policy in accordance with State law. The requirements of this policy prevail over any conflicting provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into on or after September 24, 2012.<br />
<u><br />
Definition of “Teacher”</u></p>
<p>Notwithstanding Ohio Revised Code § 3319.09, this policy applies to District employees who meet one of the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>A teacher working under a license issued under Ohio Revised Code (ORC) Sections 3319.22, 3319.26, 3319.222 or 3319.226 who spends at least 50% of his/her time providing student instruction; or</li>
<li>A teacher working under a permanent certificate issued under ORC 3319.222 as existed prior to September 2003 who spends at least 50% of his/her time providing student instruction; or</li>
<li>A teacher working under a permanent certificate issued under ORC 3319.222 as it existed prior to September 2006 who spends at least 50% of his/her time providing student instruction.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Assigning an Effectiveness Rating</u></p>
<p>Each evaluation will result in an effectiveness rating in accordance with the State Board of Education Framework.</p>
<p><u>Calculating Teacher Performance</u></p>
<p>Teacher Performance is evaluated during cycles of formal observations and classroom walkthroughs. Fifty-percent (50%) of the effectiveness rating will be attributed to Teacher Performance through a process based upon the Ohio Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>The Superintendent/designee selects/develops evaluation tools to calculate teacher performance in consultation with teachers. The Board directs the Superintendent/designee to develop procedures for these evaluation tools in consultation with teachers.</p>
<p><u>Calculating Student Growth Measures</u></p>
<p>For purposes of this policy, “student growth” means the change in student achievement for an individual student between two or more points in time. This component of the evaluation includes, where available, one or more of the following: 1) Teacher-level Value-Added Data (or alternative student academic progress measures if adopted by ODE); 2) ODE-Approved Assessments; and/or 3) Locally-determined Measures; in accordance with state law and State<br />
Board of Education requirements.</p>
<p>Fifty percent (50%) of a teacher’s evaluation must be comprised of student growth measures. The extent to which Value-Added, alternative student academic progress measures, ODE-Approved Assessments, and Locally-determined Measures (student learning objectives (“SLOs”)) are used to calculate the student-growth component of a teacher’s evaluation will be in accordance with state law and regulation.</p>
<p>In the calculation for student academic growth, students shall be excluded per state law and regulation.</p>
<p><u>Evaluation Timeline</u></p>
<p>Credentialed evaluators shall evaluate all teachers annually, except that teachers receiving a final summative rating of “Accomplished” on their most recent evaluation carried out under this policy shall be evaluated once every two years. Annual evaluations of teachers who are on limited or extended limited contracts pursuant to State law and are under consideration for non-renewal shall, in the final contract year, include at least three formal observations of at least 30 minutes each and classroom walkthroughs. Evaluations of all other teachers shall include at least two formal observations of at least 30 minutes each and classroom walkthroughs. All teacher evaluations must be completed on or before May 1, with a written report of the evaluation results provided to the teacher on or before May 10.</p>
<p><u>Professional Growth and Improvement Plans</u></p>
<p>The PLSD Board and PCS Governing Board will provide professional development and growth opportunities in accordance with State law and regulation.</p>
<p><u>Testing for Teachers in Core Subject Areas</u></p>
<p>Beginning with the 2015-16 school year, teachers who teach in a “core subject area” who have received a rating of “ineffective” on the evaluations conducted under law and this policy for two of the three most recent school years are required to register for and take all written examinations as required by State law and regulation.</p>
<p><u>Reduction in Force and Promotion Decisions</u></p>
<p>Evaluations shall be considered when making reduction in force and promotion decisions. Seniority shall not be a basis for making a reduction in force decision, except when making a decision between teachers who have comparable evaluations.</p>
<p><u>Removal of Poorly-Performing Teachers</u></p>
<p>Evaluations shall be considered when the Board proceeds according to statute to remove poorly-performing teachers.</p>
<p><u>Professional Development</u></p>
<p>The PLSD Board and PCS Governing Board will provide for the allocation of financial resources to support professional development to the extent required by State law and the State Board of Education evaluation framework.</p>

<p><strong>FOOD ALLERGIES<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The School has adopted this policy to create a framework for accommodating students with food allergies and to reduce the likelihood of severe allergic reactions of students with known food allergies while at school or engaged in school-sponsored activities.  Outlined in procedure are student, parents/guardians, and district responsibilities, including developing and implementing, where appropriate, a Student Specialized Health Care or Emergency Care plan for each known food-allergic student.</p>
<p>High-risk situations may potentially occur in any school setting for students with life-threatening food allergies.  Even with planning and management, accidental contact with an offending allergen is always a possibility.  Food-allergic students, their physicians, parents/guardians, other students and parents, and school staff should all work together to maintain a safe atmosphere for food-allergic students.</p>

<p><strong>FOOD ALLERGIES</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to provide information to and outline guidelines for the Pickerington Community School (PCS) staff in support of children with food allergies. Personnel, parents/guardians, students and their physicians should work together to minimize risks and provide a safe education environment in which the food-allergic student can be actively engaged in learning.  A food allergy is an abnormal response of the immune system to a food protein (allergen).  Each food-allergic person’s symptoms and level of sensitivity is unique and may fluctuate over time, depending on multiple variables.</p>
<p>The guidelines in this document directly support efforts to adapt the school environment to accommodate the medical needs of students with food allergies.  These measures focus on training, information and education, allergen avoidance, and emergency readiness.  Students are encouraged to take increased responsibility for their food-allergic medical condition as they mature.   The guidelines, strategies and procedures may be adapted in the case of other life-threatening allergies such as insect bites, medication reactions and latex allergies.</p>
<p><u>Guidelines for the School District</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Staff Training</li>
</ol>
<p>Annual training will take place for all pertinent building staff including teachers, special area teachers, building aides, transportation personnel, and other staff identified by the school nurse as requiring this knowledge because of reasonably anticipated contact with a food-allergic student.  To the extent reasonably possible, training should take place before the first day of classes.  Training should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>how to recognize the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions;</li>
<li>how to administer epinephrine or other emergency treatment;</li>
<li>importance of calling 911 as soon as possible, and immediately after epinephrine or other emergency treatment has been administered;</li>
<li>training for those individuals most likely to be present in the event of a food-allergic student’s adverse reaction.  The building nurse together with the student’s physician where appropriate, will provide such training and include epinephrine or other emergency treatment use.  Training will also include location of epinephrine or other emergency treatment within the school building.  Training should take place before the first day of school for students and</li>
<li>training should include reference to the PLSD/PCS’s administration of medication policies and individual students’ health plans, where appropriate.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Information and Education</u></p>
<ol>
<li><u>Anaphylaxis</u></li>
</ol>
<p>Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening medical condition that requires immediate emergency medical attention.  Anaphylactic symptoms affect multiple systems in the body.   The most dangerous symptoms include breathing difficulties and a drop in blood pressure or shock that are potentially fatal.  Anaphylaxis typically occurs either immediately or up to two hours following allergen exposure.  Anaphylaxis is usually treated with the administration of epinephrine, a prescribed medication that immediately counteracts the life-threatening symptoms.  Epinephrine is delivered by an injection that is easily administered.</p>
<p>When in doubt, medical advice indicates that it is better to give the student’s prescribed epinephrine or other emergency treatment and seek medical attention.  Fatalities can occur when epinephrine is withheld.  It is imperative that following the administration of epinephrine, the student be transported by emergency medical services to the hospital emergency department even if symptoms appear to be resolved.  In about one- third of anaphylactic reactions, the initial symptoms are followed by a late phase of symptoms two to four hours later.</p>
<ol>
<li>Parents/guardians must provide PCS with required forms regarding their student’s medical condition before the beginning of the school year or as soon as a food allergy diagnosis is determined  (as per the school’s policy on Administering Medicines to Students).  Emergency medication should be provided by the parent for maintenance and use consistent with the directions of the student’s physician and PLSD/PCS policy.</li>
<li>Parents/guardians should complete a food allergy action plan, received from the school nurse, before the beginning of the school year.  Where appropriate, written guidance from the student’s physician should be included in the plan.</li>
<li>With parental/guardian consent, a food allergy action plan or an emergency health care plan will be prominently placed in substitute teacher folders.</li>
<li>In grades K through 6, with parental/guardian consent, the school nurse will send out form letters to classmates’ parents/guardians informing them of a life-threatening food allergy in the classroom.</li>
<li>A door-alert poster outside the classroom will identify allergens not allowed in the K-6 classrooms.</li>
<li>The school nurse may educate classmates regarding food allergies.  Age-appropriate educational materials, including educational videos, can be used.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Allergen Avoidance</u></p>
<ol>
<li>To the extent reasonably possible, classroom projects should not include substances known to cause allergic reactions to students.  If an educational project calls for using an allergen and a safe substitute is not an option, then restrict the activity to a food-appropriate area outside the classroom (i.e., cafeteria, teachers lounge).  The food-allergic student may opt out of the project if he/she is uncomfortable around the project, with parental notification.</li>
<li>On those occasions when snacks or treats are served in the classroom, the parents/guardians of the food-allergic student will provide a safe alternate snack/treat to be kept in the classroom for their student.</li>
<li>Where appropriate, all children in the same classroom as a pupil subject to allergic reaction, will be encouraged to wash their hands following lunch and/or recess.</li>
<li>If requested by parents/guardians, have an allergen free table available for use during lunch periods.  The table should be labeled with appropriate allergen-free status (usually peanut/tree nut).</li>
<li>Food-allergic students should be exempted from work requiring contact with food.</li>
<li>On field trips, all food for the food-allergic student should be provided by the parents/guardians (not purchased by student during field trip).  Student may purchase food during a field trip only with parental permission.</li>
<li>All students will be reminded never to share or trade food.</li>
<li>In the event an exposure occurs, an investigation will be done to attempt to identify and eliminate the cause of the exposure.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Emergency Readiness</u></p>
<ol>
<li>The food allergy action plan and the emergency health care plan should be updated annually and whenever changes are necessary.  They should be accessible to school staff.</li>
<li>Epinephrine or other emergency treatment medication should be provided and stored in accordance with Board policy and should be accessible at all times during school hours to appropriately trained school staff.</li>
<li>Medic alert-type jewelry (typically bracelet), provided by parents/guardians, is recommended for the student.  If used, the student is responsible for wearing it during school hours.</li>
<li>if student rides the school bus to and/or from school, the parents/guardians, student’s physician, school nurse, and transportation department should work together to determine where the epinephrine or other emergency treatment and medication will be on the school bus (i.e., with the driver or bus aide or with the student).  To the extent reasonably possible, this step should be taken before the first day of classes for students.</li>
<li>The school nurse must be notified ahead of time by the teacher of an upcoming field trip to prepare medication for the field trip.  The teacher should make sure that all emergency medications are brought on the trip as well as emergency information, and is kept with the student’s teacher at all times.</li>
<li>On field trips, school personnel should supervise the food-allergic student, should know about the food-allergic student and his/her health needs, be educated in age-appropriate signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction, and be trained in the use of emergency medication.  Parental supervision of food-allergic students on field trips is encouraged.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>School-Sponsored Activities</u></p>
<p>Food-allergic students who wish to engage in school-sponsored athletic activities should provide written approval from their individual physicians, together with any necessary guidance, to ensure the student’s welfare.  The parents/guardians, along with support from the school nurse, should notify the appropriate activity advisors about the care of the food-allergic student and train them in the use of emergency medications.</p>
<p><u>Guidelines for School Personnel</u></p>
<p>School personnel are asked to assist in the daily prevention, care and management of students with food allergies and allergic reactions.  They are encouraged to foster age-appropriate independence on the part of the student, based on his/her developmental stage.  This will obviously vary greatly.  To achieve this goal, teachers should consider these guidelines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep information for substitute teachers in an organized, prominent and accessible format.   Include the food allergy action plan in a prominent location within the substitute folder.</li>
<li>Inform parents/guardians of allergic student in advance of any in-class events where food will be present.</li>
<li>Encourage the use of non-food rewards in the classroom.</li>
<li>Implement school-level appropriate information, education, allergen avoidance, and emergency readiness suggestions as outlined in this document as needed.</li>
<li>Modify class materials as needed to restrict allergen use in classroom.</li>
<li>If contamination by an allergen is suspected, have a custodian or designated adult wash area of contamination.</li>
<li>Encourage hand washing before and after eating.</li>
<li>Immediately initiate the food allergy action plan if a student reports signs of an allergic reaction.</li>
<li>In those circumstances where food use, preparation, and cooking are part of the curriculum, parents/guardians and teacher will discuss food restrictions and alternative activities on an individual basis.</li>
<li>Health care responsibilities that involve the custodial staff will be communicated directly to the head custodian.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Guidelines for Students with Life-Threatening Food Allergies</u></p>
<p>The long-term goal for individuals with life-threatening food allergies is to be independent in the prevention and management of their food allergies and allergic reactions based on their developmental level.  Keeping this in mind, studies with life-threatening food allergies should understand and follow these guidelines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Never trade or share food.</li>
<li>Wash hands before and after eating.</li>
<li>Do not eat anything with unknown ingredients or ingredients known to contain an offending allergen.</li>
<li>If the student is uncertain of ingredients of foods offered at a classroom celebration, school bake sale, or athletic/social event, student should seek the help of a knowledgeable adult (teacher, nurse, event coordinator, or parent/guardian).</li>
<li>Always read the ingredient label before eating food.</li>

<p><u>Guidelines for Parents/Guardians</u></p>
<p>Parents and guardians are asked to assist the school in the prevention, care and management of their child’s’ food allergies and allergic reactions.  Parents/guardians are encouraged to foster age-appropriate independence on the part of their child, based on his/her developmental level and risk assessment of the situation.  To achieve these goals, parents/guardians should follow these guidelines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Inform the school and the school nurse of the child’s allergies prior to the beginning of the school year or immediately following diagnosis of the medical condition.</li>
<li>Provide an executed release of information form to enable the student’s physician and appropriate school personnel to exchange information.</li>
<li>Complete and submit all required school medical forms in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Provide a photograph of the child if requested by the school staff.</li>
<li>Provide up-to-date medications and back-up dosages as required, together with all other documentation required by Board Policy.</li>
<li>Periodically check expiration dates on all provided medications and replace as needed.</li>
<li>Provide a medic alert-type bracelet or necklace for your child.</li>
<li>Introduce the child to and work with appropriate school staff, notify them of the child’s food allergy, instruct them regarding signs and symptoms, and appropriate responses.</li>
<li>Parents/guardians should inform food-allergic students and appropriate school personnel as to what food may be safe to eat at the school cafeteria.</li>
<li>Grant the child increased responsibility for management of his/her food allergies as they grow older and become developmentally ready. Reinforce, as age allows, the student responsibilities previously mentioned in this document, train the child on how to administer his/her own medications, and empower him/her to inform others of their food allergy and specific needs.</li>

<p><strong>INVENTORIES (FIXED ASSETS)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>In order to conform to Ohio financial reporting standards, and to provide property insurance information, the School maintains a Fixed Asset System, which is a system of methods, policies and procedures for recording and reporting monetary amounts to account for School-owned real property and equipment.</p>
<p>Fixed assets are defined as those assets that are deemed to be tangible, such as land, buildings, furniture and fixtures, equipment, vehicles, improvements other than buildings and construction in process. Fixed assets are those, which are not expendable supplies; which have a useful life of more than three years and which have an acquisition value in excess of $5,000. Exceptions for control and insurance extend this definition to include audio-visual equipment, musical instruments and computers. Any non-removable articles are included in the assigned value of the structure in which they are installed.</p>
<p>Staff members participate in the continuous updating of the fixed asset inventories and values of School-owned equipment as may be deemed necessary. The Treasurer is authorized to contract for the annual fixed asset inventory and establishment of values for all real estate and equipment owned by the Governing Board.</p>
<p>Fixed assets are discarded, destroyed or otherwise disposed of after 1) approval of the supervisor, principal and/or Superintendent and Governing Board President and 2) notification of Treasurer’s office for records maintenance.</p>
<p>The disposal of a fixed asset(s) begins by submitting a Request to Dispose of a Fixed Asset form to the Superintendent. The form must be complete and signed by the appropriate supervisor or school administrator.</p>
<p>Items defined as fixed assets are disposed of according to State law when the value exceeds $10,000. If that section of the code does not apply and the asset(s) has marketable value, it is disposed of by accepting a fair market value for the asset(s) as determined by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>When a fixed asset(s) has a fair market value of $100 or more as determined by the Superintendent, notice is sent through School and Sponsoring District’s communications that such an asset(s) is available for sale. Persons interested in purchasing the asset(s) notify the Superintendent, in writing, providing a definition of the asset(s) and the price offered for it. Generally, the highest price offered is accepted in the event of two or more persons showing interest in the same purchase.</p>
<p>If the asset(s) has no use and/or market value, it is disposed of through normal disposal procedures such as placing in a dumpster or taking to a landfill.</p>
<p>During the school year in which the resale or disposal occurred, the asset(s) is located on the most current fixed asset inventory and removed from that inventory. It appears on the disposal list of fixed assets for the year in which it was disposed.</p>

<p><strong>PARTNERSHIPS WITH BUSINESS</strong></p>
<p>The Governing Board is well aware of the role that education will play in increasing the nation’s productivity and future well-being. To ensure success requires the combining of talent and resources within the region between business and education. It also recognizes that schools of the District need to operate as an integral part of the economic community if students are to receive the type of education and training they will need to function effectively in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>The Board will seek to establish not only partnerships between the District and individual companies but also, if possible, consortia involving several companies and/or school districts. The purpose will be to seek opportunities for students and staff to share in new strategies and technologies being created in the business world and offer, in exchange, the knowledge and skill of District personnel in creating more effective continuing education for employees and members of the community. Properly planned and implemented, such partnerships or consortia could have significant impact on the nature and content of the curriculum as well as on the manner in which students are taught to learn.</p>
<p>The Superintendent is authorized to actively seek such participants.</p>

<p><strong>PROGRAMS FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS (POLICY)</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with the belief that all children are entitled to education commensurate with their particular needs, children who are gifted are provided opportunities to progress as their abilities permit.  The Board believes that these children require services beyond those offered in regular school programs in order to realize their potential contribution to themselves and society. Identification eligibility criteria as specified in the Operating Standards for Identifying and Servicing Gifted Students will be used to identify students</p>
<p>Children who are gifted, are identified annually by qualified professionals using a variety of assessment procedures.  The Board encourages efforts to provide services for the children who are gifted as an integral part of the total educational programs.</p>
<p><u>Identification</u></p>
<p>The District follows the identification eligibility criteria as specified in the Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio Administrative Code.</p>
<p>1. PCS identifies children in the District, in grades 9 through 12, as gifted children who perform at remarkably high levels of accomplishment when compared to other children of the same age, experience and environment, as identified under the Ohio Revised Code and Ohio Administration Code.</p>
<blockquote><p>Accordingly, a child can be identified as exhibiting:</p>
<p>A. superior cognitive ability;</p>
<p>B. specific academic ability in one or more of the following content areas:</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>mathematics</li>
<li>science</li>
<li>reading, writing or a combination of these skills and/or</li>
<li>social studies</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>C. creative thinking ability and/or</p>
<p>D. visual or performing arts ability such as drawing, painting, sculpting, music, dance or drama.</p></blockquote>
<p>2. Instruments approved by the Ohio Department of Education shall be used for screening, assessments, and identification of children who are gifted as provided in the Chart of Approved Assessment Instruments for Gifted Screening and Identification. The school shall select instruments from the approved list that will allow for appropriate screening and identification of minority and disadvantaged students, students with disabilities and students for whom English is a second language.</p>
<p><u>Plan for Identifying Gifted Students</u></p>
<p>The school follows the sponsor’s plan for the screening, assessment and identification of children who are gifted. Any revisions to the district’s plan are submitted to the Ohio Department of Education for approval by the sponsoring district.</p>
<p>The identification plan includes the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>the criteria and methods used to screen and select children for further assessment who perform or show potential for performing at remarkably high levels of accomplishment in one of the gifted areas;</li>
<li>the sources of assessment data used to select children for further testing and an explanation to parents/guardians of the multiple assessment instruments required to identify children who are gifted;</li>
<li>an explanation for parents/guardians of the methods used to ensure equal access to screening and further assessment to all students, culturally and linguistically diverse children, children from low socio-economic backgrounds, children with disabilities and children for who English is a second language;</li>
<li>the process of notifying parents/guardians regarding all policies and procedures concerning the screening, assessment and identification of children who are gifted;</li>
<li>procedures for transfer students and how they will be screened and assessed within ninety (90) days of transfer. Identification information provided by other school districts which meets the requirements specified by the Ohio Department of Education will be accepted.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>at least two opportunities a year for assessment in the case of children requesting assessment or recommended for assessment by teachers, parents or other children;</li>
<li>an explanation that the school accepts scores on assessment instruments approved for use by the Ohio Department of Education that are approved by other school districts and trained personnel outside the Pickerington Local School district; and</li>
<li>an opportunity for parents/guardians to appeal any decision about the results of any screening procedure or assessment, the scheduling of children for assessment or the placement of a student in any program or for receipt of services. The principal or designee will issue a decision, providing notice of the team&#8217;s reasons for that decision. Assessment results must be appealed within ten days of receiving scores.  Eligibility and requirement into the gifted program cannot be appealed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The plan may provide for the school to contract with any qualified public or private service provider to provide screening or assessment services under the plan.  Gifted education coordinators provide the school with assistance in placing students, designing services, consulting on strategic planning, evaluating services on an ongoing basis and eliciting input from parents and staff.</p>
<p><u>Plan for Services</u></p>
<p>The school adopts and submits to the Ohio Department of Education, a plan for a continuum of services that may be offered to students who are gifted.</p>
<p>The school shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure equal opportunity for all children identified as gifted to receive any or all services offered by the school;</li>
<li>Implement a procedure for withdrawal of children from gifted services and for reassessment of children;</li>
<li>Implement a procedure for resolving disputes with regard to identification and placement decisions;</li>
<li>Ensure education services are delivered in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio Administration Code; and</li>
<li>Inform parents of the contents of this policy as required by the Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio Administrative Code.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Written Education Plan</u></p>
<p>The school provides gifted services based on the student’s areas(s) of identification and individual needs and is guided by a written education plan (WEP). The WEP, which is provided to parents of gifted students and educators responsible for providing gifted education services, includes a description of the services provided, including goals for the student in each service specified, methods for evaluating progress toward achieving the goals specified and methods and schedule for reporting progress to students. The WEP also specifies staff members responsible for ensuring that specified services are delivered, policies regarding the waiver of assignments and the scheduling of tests missed while a student is participating in any gifted services provided outside the general education classroom and a date by which the WEP will be reviewed for possible revision.</p>

<p><strong>PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</strong></p>
<p>All students with disabilities attending Pickerington Community School are identified, evaluated and placed in appropriate educational programs. Due process requirements, procedural safeguards and confidential treatment of information are adhered to as required by State and Federal law.</p>
<p>The Superintendent is expected to supervise all special education programs and to assign a member of the staff to coordinate efforts. The person designated is responsible for the identification of students with disabilities, the evaluation of disabilities and evaluation procedures, the design of Individualized Education Programs (IEP), plans and placement. All procedures are in accordance with State and Federal law.</p>
<p>The IEP determined for each identified student is developed in accordance with the student’s individual needs. The plan provides for re-evaluation of the student’s needs, progress and effectiveness of the program being offered.</p>
<p>Although the school requires all students with disabilities to be tested, each student with a disability is considered individually relative to his/her participation in the District’s educational and testing programs. Alternative assessments may be required. Students must make yearly gains towards closing the achievement gap as defined by the State Board of Education performance targets.</p>
<p>The Governing Board, by resolution, directs the administration to comply with and follow the Ohio Department of Education, Office of Exceptional Children’s model special education policies and procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Programs for Students with Disabilities &#8211; Regulations</strong></p>
<p>As an expression of its commitment to provide a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) for students with disabilities in accordance with State and Federal law, rules and regulations, the Governing Board does hereby resolve to implement the following.</p>
<ol>
<li><u>Child Identification</u></li>
</ol>
<p>Ongoing efforts are made to identify, locate and evaluate children below 22 years of age who attend the school and have a confirmed or suspected disability in accordance with all federal regulations and State Standards.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><u>Procedural Safeguards</u></li>
</ol>
<p>The child with a disability and his/her parent(s) are provided with safeguards, as required by law, throughout the identification, evaluation and placement process and the provision of a FAPE to the child.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><u>Multi-factored Evaluation</u></li>
</ol>
<p>The School provides a multi-factored evaluation for children with disabilities by ensuring that children are assessed in their native language or other mode of communication. Tests are used for their validated purposes. Children are evaluated in all areas related to their suspected disability. Testing is conducted by a multidisciplinary team. Testing materials and procedures are not racially or culturally biased. Tests are administered by trained personnel qualified in accordance with all federal regulations and State Standards and in conformance with the instructions provided by the producer. Medical evaluation, when required as part of the multi-factored evaluation, is provided at no cost to the parent(s) by a licensed physician designated by the Superintendent/designee when other no-cost resources are not available.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><u>Individualized Education Program</u></li>
</ol>
<p>An Individualized Education Program (IEP) is developed for each child with a disability who needs special education. The IEP is designed to meet the unique educational needs of the child and developed in a planning conference. The parent(s) of the child are strongly encouraged to participate in the planning conference. The IEP is reviewed and revised as often as necessary, but at least annually.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><u>Least Restrictive Environment</u></li>
</ol>
<p>The education of children with disabilities occurs in the least restrictive environment. Special education programs and services are appropriate and designed to meet the unique needs of each child with a disability. To the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who do not have disabilities. Special classes, separate schooling or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occur only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><u>Confidentiality of Data</u></li>
</ol>
<p>The confidentiality of personally identifiable data relating to children with disabilities and their parents and families is protected at collection, storage, disclosure and destruction. One official of the School is assigned the responsibility for protecting the confidentiality of personally identifiable data. The School follows all federal regulations and State Standards related to the confidentiality of data.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><u>Due Process</u></li>
</ol>
<p>The School utilizes procedures that allow differences of opinion to be aired and resolved between parent(s) or agencies and the School. The procedures provide for utilization of case conferences, administrative reviews, impartial due process hearings, state-level appeals and appeals to the courts that involve the School’s proposal or refusal to initiate or change the identification, evaluation or educational placement of the child or the provision of a FAPE to the child. Furthermore, the rights of children with disabilities are protected when the parents cannot be identified or located, when the child is a ward of the state or when the child is without a formally declared legal representative.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><u>Surrogate Parent</u></li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever the parent(s) of a child with a disability are not known or cannot be located, when the child is a ward of the state, or when parents have otherwise lost legal decision-making abilities, the child’s rights are protected through the assignment of an individual (who is not an employee of the state education agency, local education agency or other organization involved in the education or care of the child) who serves as the child’s surrogate parent.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><u>Testing Programs</u></li>
</ol>
<p>Students with disabilities must participate in local and statewide testing programs. Individual exemptions, accommodations, and participation in an alternate assessment are determined only during an IEP conference.</p>

<p><strong>PROMOTION, PLACEMENT AND RETENTION OF STUDENTS</strong></p>
<p>The promotion, retention or replacement of each student in the Community School will be determined individually. The decision to promote, place or retain a student in a grade will be made on the basis of the following factors which the principal will take into consideration; mental ability, age, physical maturity, emotional and social development, grade average, mastery of standards, and (at certain grade levels) state test results.</p>
<p>Promotion and placement procedures demand continuous analysis and study of the cumulative student case history records to that guesswork and conjecture may be reduced to a minimum and decisions may be as objective as possible, using data to support decision making.</p>
<p>The retention of a student should be done only if it presents the possibility of allowing the child to function successfully at grade level in academic, social and emotional areas. Retention is viewed as another opportunity for growth at a particular level of study.</p>

<li>Any student who is truant for more than 10% of the required attendance days of the current school year and has failed two or more of the required curriculum subject areas in the current grade is retained, unless the student’s principal and the teachers of the failed subject areas agree that the student is academically prepared to be promoted to the next grade level.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>“Academically prepared,” as used in this policy, means that the principal, in consultation with the student’s teacher(s), has reviewed the student’s work and records and has concluded that the student is capable of progressing through and successfully completing work at the next grade level.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>For a student with a disability who is currently on an active IEP, the final decision concerning retention, placement or promotion shall be made by his/her IEP team.</li>

<p><u>Procedures</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Parents will be notified of the possibility of placement or retention.</li>
<li>The following people may be involved in deciding retention, placement and promotion of a student:

<li>the classroom teacher(s) and any other teacher who works with the child;</li>
<li>parents;</li>
<li>principal;</li>
<li>school counselor;</li>
<li>speech therapist; or</li>

<li>Once a decision has been reached by the principal, the parents will be notified in writing.  Parents will have ten (10) days to appeal the decision.  Such appeal shall be made in writing to the Superintendent.</li>
<li>For a student with a disability who is currently on an active IEP, the final decision concerning retention, placement or promotion shall be made by his/her IEP team.</li>
</ol>
<p>Statement of the Community School</p>
<p>Because students are able to work on multiple grade level curriculum at a time, it is possible for a student by Ohio Standards to showing as a grade based on age, however; working on classes above or below that grade level. When a student falls academically below the where they should be, the school administrator and guidance counselor will work closely with those students and parents to ensure progress towards graduation.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Times;">PUBLIC’S RIGHT TO KNOW</span></strong></p>
<p>The Governing Board supports the right of the people to know about the programs and services of their schools and makes efforts to disseminate appropriate information. The school administrator, in conjunction with the Superintendent, is authorized and expected to keep the school’s community informed about the school’s programs and activities. Business of the Governing Board is discussed and decisions are made at public meetings, except such matters as are properly discussed in private, executive sessions. The official minutes of the Governing Board, its written policies, its financial records and all other public records are open for inspection in the Treasurer’s office during the hours when the administration offices are open. Records pertaining to individual students and other confidential materials are not released for inspection by the public or any unauthorized persons, either by the Treasurer, Superintendent or other persons responsible for the custody of confidential files. Only that information deemed “directory information” may be released from an individual student’s file, and only after complying with the regulations prepared by the administration for the release of such information. Student records that consist of “personally identifiable information” generally are exempt from disclosure. Student directory information, however, is released unless the parents have affirmatively withdrawn their consent to release in writing. Any individual who wants to obtain a copy of a public record may request to have the record duplicated on paper, on the same medium on which the record is kept or on any other medium the Superintendent/designee determines that the record can reasonably be duplicated as an integral part of normal operations. The School may ask that the request be put in writing. However, the School must notify the requester that it is not mandatory to do so. The School provides an opportunity for a records requester making an ambiguous or overly broad request to revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in which records are maintained. 2 If a public records request is denied, the School provides an explanation with legal authority as to the reason for the denial of the request. If the person seeking the copy makes a choice under this provision, the School must provide the record in accordance with that choice if available to the School. A fee may be charged for copies. The School may require the fee charged for copies be paid in advance. The person making a mail request pays the cost of postage and other supplies in advance. The number of mail requests sent to any one person is limited to 10 per month unless the person certifies in writing that the records, or the information in them, will not be used for commercial purposes. The Governing Board’s public records policy is posted in a conspicuous location at the school and on the school’s website.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">All employees of the school and the Pickerington Community School who know or suspect that a child under 18 years of age or a disabled child under the age of 22 has suffered or is suffering any type of abuse or neglect are required to immediately report, in good faith, such information to the public children services agency or the local law enforcement agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">To ensure prompt reports, procedures for reporting are made known to the school staff.  A person who participates in making such reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability, provided the report is made in good faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Each person employed by the Board to work as a school nurse, teacher, counselor, psychologist or administrator shall complete at least four hours of in-service training in child abuse prevention, violence and substance abuse and the promotion of positive youth development within two years of commencing employment with the District, and every five years thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Conversely, public children’s services agencies must notify the Superintendent of any allegations of child abuse and neglect reported to them involving the District, as well as the disposition of the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">In addition, employees who work as teachers, counselors, school health assistants, school psychologists and administrators must receive training in dating violence prevention.  The curriculum for training in dating violence prevention is developed by the Superintendent/designee and training must occur within two years of commencing employment and every five years thereafter.</span></p>

<p><strong>REPORTING CHILD ABUSE (REGULATIONS)</strong></p>
<p><u>Penalties for Failure to Report</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Failure of a mandated reporter to report a case of suspected child abuse is a violation of the State law (a fourth-degree misdemeanor).</li>
<li>Reports may not be withheld for reasons such as protecting the alleged perpetrator.</li>
<li>The mandated reporter, and the school itself, is legally granted immunity from civil or criminal liability for making the report in good faith or participating in any legal proceeding resulting from the report.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Cases Which Must Be Reported</u></p>
<p>Mandated reporters must report the following types of cases when they have reason to suspect the occurrence of abuse or neglect.  You will note that certain types of cases are clear-cut, others are defined by severity and factors relating to amount of danger to the child.   When in doubt about the need to report, it is suggested that a call be made to Child Protective Services to discuss the case in general, after which a formal report can be made, if indicated.</p>
<ol>
<li><u>Child</u> – A person under the age of 18.  A mentally disabled individual under the age of 22.  The types of abuse, neglect or dependency defined below presume the alleged victim is a child as defined.</li>
<li><u>Physical Abuse</u> &#8211; Non-accidental injury to a child likely to have been committed by a parent, guardian or anyone who has a full- or part-time responsibility for the child at the time the abuse or neglect occurred.</li>
<li><u>Child Neglect</u> – Failure of a parent, guardian or other caretaker to provide for the child’s basic physical needs.  Common types of neglect are lack of adequate supervision, unsafe housing, malnutrition and failure to provide necessary medical care.</li>
<li><u>Sexual Abuse</u> – Any act of a sexual nature that implies victimization of a child.  This includes the physical molestation of a child as well as situations where no physical contact has occurred, such as intentionally exposing a child to pornography, taking sexually explicit pictures of a child, voyeurism of a child, etc.</li>
<li><u>Emotional Neglect</u> &#8211; Failure to provide the necessary support and/or affection essential to the child’s development or emotional well-being.  Due to the fact that emotional neglect is a very value-laden concept, it is suggested that, in most cases, referrals to counseling agencies and use of school resources to assist the family/child, should be employed prior to referral to Child Protective Services.  Refusal of clearly required services would be reason to report the case.</li>
<li><u>Dependency</u> &#8211; A child who lacks proper care or support through no fault of the caretaker.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Procedure for Making Reports</u></p>
<ol>
<li>An individual who suspects abuse or neglect shall make a report to Child Protective Services or to local law enforcement in special circumstances in the school deems the child to be in immediate danger.  All mandated reporters should contact the building principal/designee immediately upon determining that there is reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect.  School personnel are advised not to be investigators.</li>
<li>Oral report should be made as soon as possible (as early in the day as possible if it is important for the child to be seen before returning home).  Calls are to be made to the intake Department of the Fairfield County Child Protective Services at (614) 653-4060 from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  After hours, and on weekends or holidays, contact the Sheriff’s Office at 653-5223 (ask to have Child Protective Services paged).</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Involvement After the Report is Made</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Caseworkers are to be permitted entry into the school (ask for caseworker’s Child Protective Services’ ID Card) to interview children in cases of child abuse or neglect and to take photographs if necessary.  The principal and/or other school staff are to arrange for a private room for conducting the evaluation.  It is permitted for a school person to be in the room during the interview; however, such involvement should be based on whether or not the child will feel comfortable with this person.  Ordinarily, only one school person should be in the room.  Unless requested to intervene, the school person present should not engage in asking questions.  If the child is considered to be in imminent danger, the caseworker may order the child into emergency custody.  This decision will be based on danger to the child, ability to prove this in court, and the determination of whether or not the child can be protected in the home.</li>
<li>Child Protective Services is responsible for notifying parents of an investigation of suspected abuse and of the interviews that have taken place with the child.  The school should not notify the parents, before or after the interview, with consultation with Child Protective Services staff since this contact may, in some cases, place the child at further risk.</li>
<li>When reporting a case of suspected child abuse, it is helpful if the reporter can provide as much of the identifying information contained in the “Follow Up Report: Suspected Child Abuse” as possible (e.g., child’s name, DOB, grade, parents’ names, addresses, home and work phone numbers and custodial arrangements if child does not live with both parents).   Also helpful is information about siblings of the alleged victim (ages and schools) and the alleged victim’s previous schools.</li>
<li>After making the oral report to Child Protective Services, it is helpful to complete and mail the “Follow Up Report:  Suspected Child Abuse” form and mail it to Child Protective Services (to the attention of the Intake Department).  Completion and submission of this form will assure that information has been communicated clearly between the reporter and the agency and will provide the school with a record of the report.<br />
When submitting the written report, provide any additional documentation related to the report of suspected abuse.  The school may release information to Child Protective Services, which is related to the suspicion of abuse or neglect.If additional information or clarification of the referral is necessary, the caseworker will maintain contact with the school; however, it is critical that school personnel re-contact Child Protective Services if further information comes to light or further incidents occur.  If the caseworker cannot be reached, contact the caseworker’s supervisor.</li>
<li>Child Protective Services will send a letter confirming receipt of the report.  The letter will be addressed to the individual who made the initial report.  The letter will state whether or not the agency has accepted the referral for investigation and the name of the caseworker assigned to the case.  Additional information will be made available to professional referral sources later in the course of the investigation if specifically requested.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Other</u></p>
<p>1. School Personnel and Court Testimony:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Occasionally school personnel will be requested to testify in Court (Juvenile or Criminal).  Child Protective Service will provide a subpoena and notice of the hearing for Juvenile Court hearings requiring testimony of school personnel.  Criminal court hearings and trials are handled by the Municipal or County Prosecutor’s Offices.</p>
<p>School staff is authorized to attend and testify at these hearings.  Upon receipt of a subpoena, immediately contact the building principal.</p></blockquote>
<p>2. Confidentiality:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any information regarding child abuse and neglect is strictly confidential.  This includes information obtained during and after “in-school” interview of the child.  Information about the case is made available to school staff on the premise that confidentiality will be adhered to and that no information will be disclosed without the agency’s prior approval.</p></blockquote>
<p>3. Note to all school personnel: if questions or problems arise regarding referral of child abuse and neglect cases, contact the Intake Supervisor of Fairfield County Child Protective Services.</p>
<p><u>Special Cases</u></p>
<ol>
<li>School Personnel Reported for Alleged Child Abuse</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>When it is alleged that an employee of the school system has abused a student, the school is required to report this to Child Protective Services and/or law enforcement.   In order to prevent a potential “conflict of interest” concern over the school’s handling of these matters, the report should refrain from investigating the situation (except to the extent that immediate school actions may be necessary for the protection of students).  Child Protective Services procedures are as follows.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote><p>The allegation will be reviewed to determine if it meets the definition(s) of alleged child abuse or neglect.  If the allegation does not meet definitions, the agency will report the matter to the school administration for its determination of the need for internal actions.  No investigation will be done by Child Protective Services after this notification.  (Note:  Parents may refer the case to local law enforcement regardless of the agency’s determination).</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>If the allegation meets the definitions of child abuse or neglect, the agency will refer the case to law enforcement and will initiate an investigation independently or in concert with the law enforcement agency.  Child Protective Services will notify the responsible school administration of the initiation of an investigation.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Upon completion of the agency investigation, the results will be reported to the administration of the District.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>As stated above, information from Child Protective Services Investigations are, by law, made available to law enforcement agencies.  Decisions to refer cases for prosecution, and to prosecute such cases, are the responsibility of law enforcement agencies and the Municipal or County Prosecutor’s Offices.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>RESPONSE TO INTERVENTION (RTI) </strong></p>
<p>The educational program is designed and operated to be developmentally appropriate and avoid necessity for intervention. In those cases in which students have clearly not demonstrated satisfactory progress toward attaining the academic standards for their grade level, efforts are made to remedy the condition and attain the learning results sought.</p>
<p>Pickerington Community School (PCS) uses a Response to Intervention model, which is a 3-tier model process that provides intervention at increasing levels of intensity for those students who are in need of intervention.</p>
<p>PCS will establish an RTI team, which manages the intervention process. The team shall consist of the Principal or designee, school counselor, school psychologist, instructional coach, intervention teacher, and others as deemed appropriate by the building. The RTI team gathers and analyzes data to determine the tier of intervention needed by the student. Data includes, but is not limited to, universal screening results from the STAR Reading and STAR math assessments, as well as Developmental Reading Assessment, State Assessments, ASPIRE, PSAT, Otis-Lennon, teacher created assessments, MAP assessments, and progress monitoring data.</p>
<p>The School involves the student’s parent(s) and classroom teacher in selecting the intervention strategy and offers to the parent(s) the opportunity to be involved in the intervention process. Research-based intervention programs will be used with consistency and fidelity.</p>
<p>The Superintendent/designee is directed to evaluate the RTI program and report to the Board each school year as to their effectiveness in maintaining minimum levels of student proficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Student Absences and Excuses</strong></p>
<p>It is the belief of Pickerington Community School that all students are expected to have regular attendance. Students are encouraged to make appointments, do personal errands, etc., outside of school hours.</p>
<p>State law specifically requires that every child up to the age of 18 must attend school.  Absences are either classified as excused or unexcused.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Ohio Missing Child Law of the State of Ohio, all parents are required to notify the school office each day of a student’s absence by calling the school of attendance.  If a parent does not call to report a child’s absence, the school is required to contact parents regarding the absence.</p>
<p>The Ohio Administrative Code list the following as reasons for excused absences from school:</p>
<ul>
<li>Illness (doctors excuse may be required)</li>
<li>Illness inside the immediate family that necessitates the presence of the child.</li>
<li>Death of a relative (limited to 3 days)</li>
<li>Observation of religious holidays</li>
<li>Medical or dental appointment (usually a partial day)</li>
<li>Quarantine for contagious disease</li>
<li>College visitation (three approved days allowed)</li>
<li>Emergency circumstances (ex. Court appearance, required meeting with social services agency, or student required to travel with parent.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Family Vacation</u></p>
<p>Vacation days are noted in the annual school calendar.  It is the expectation of the Board that families do everything possible to plan their vacations during these times.  If this is not possible, arrangements must be made in advance through the attendance office.  All work missed must be completed and turned in on the day of return to school. Scheduling family vacations during established testing windows is strongly discouraged.</p>
<p><u>Early Dismissal</u></p>
<p>Once a student gets to school, he/she is expected to stay the <u>entire</u> day or until that student is dismissed.  Each student leaving school property during school hours will be required to have written communication from the parent or guardian. Please note that for security purposes, students will NOT be dismissed to parents following school events held during the regular school day. Parents wanting to take their child out of school early must follow the regular sign out procedures.  Any student leaving early will be counted absent for that portion of the day.</p>
<p><u>Illness During School</u></p>
<p>If a student becomes ill during the school day, he/she will be sent to the clinic.  Office personnel will follow health procedures set forth by the school nurse to determine if a child should return to a class or be sent home.  If it is deemed necessary for a child to leave school, a parent or guardian will be contacted to come to the school to pick up their child.   The parent or guardian will need to sign their child out in the school office. Exceptions can be made for high school students who provide their own transportation. Children need to be fever-free for 24 hours prior to returning to school. Students are not permitted to stay in the clinic during the school day.</p>
<p>Because of the wide variety of reasons for a student’s absence from school, the validity of an absence will be determined by the administration in each individual case.  When a student reaches seven (7) excused absences, a reminder letter will be sent home to the parent reviewing the excused absence policy.  After a student reaches twelve (12) excused absences, a physician’s note will be required for medical verification in order for the absence to be excused.</p>
<p>Please note:  Medical verification means that a physician has treated an illness or injury and has verified to the attendance office that because of the illness or injury, the student was unable to attend school.  Official medical notification (which includes the physician’s name, phone number, and specific dates of illness to be excused from school) must be submitted to the attendance office upon the student’s return to school within two (2) days following the absence.</p>
<p><u>Unexcused or Recurring Absences</u></p>
<p>Students have an obligation to attend school regularly and to abide by the rules and regulations of the Pickerington Local School District and the State of Ohio. The building administration may take disciplinary action for chronic absences.  This will be enforced on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Chronic truancy means any student of compulsory school age who has unexcused absences from school is considered truant.  Once a student accumulates five (5) unexcused absences, a letter will be sent home to the parent reviewing the unexcused absence policy and the possibility of filing truancy with the legal system as required by the Ohio Revised Code.  If the student has seven (7) consecutive unexcused absences, ten (10) unexcused absences in a month or fifteen (15) or more unexcused absences in one year, charges may be filed with the legal system for chronic truancy.  At ten (10) days, an informal hearing will occur with the student. At twelve (12) days, an administrative hearing will occur with the parent.  At fifteen (15) days, chronic truancy will be filed with the legal system. The district, if applicable, will also notify the Registrar of Motor Vehicles of any chronic truancy.</p>
<p><u>Tardiness to School</u></p>
<p>A student must be on time and in attendance every day.  Students who arrive after the tardy bell are considered tardy.  When a student has five (5) tardies in a quarter, a letter will be sent home to the parents reviewing the tardy policy.  After seven (7) tardies, a letter will be sent home to the parent requesting a meeting with the principal.  After 10 tardies, the building administrator may take disciplinary action for habitual tardiness.  This will be enforced on a case-by-case basis.  All tardies due to doctor’s, dentist’s, orthodontist’s, or court appointments, must have official documentation from that office.</p>
<p><u>Obtaining an Early Dismissal</u></p>
<p>A written explanation from a parent or guardian is to be turned into the office on the morning of the early dismissal.  A telephone number must accompany the request so the dismissal can be confirmed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though a student is excused, it will be recorded on his/her attendance record as an absence since that student is not present in school.</li>
<li>Upon return from an early dismissal (same day), the parent will be expected to sign the student back into the office.</li>
<li>Telephone requests for excuse of a student will not be honored due to safety and security concerns.</li>
<li>Exceptions can be made for high school students who provide their own transportation with verification from parent/guardian.  (formerly 3)</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Religious Holiday</u></p>
<p>It is the parents’ responsibility to notify the school office at least one day prior, when their child will miss school for a recognized religious holiday. The absence will be adjusted to reflect religious observation. The student will be required to complete all assignments missed while out.</p>
<p><u>Administrative Discretion</u></p>
<p>The school administration has the ultimate authority in all attendance-related matters and reserves the right for discretionary deviation from the aforementioned attendance policies.</p>
<p>An online curriculum allows a student to move at their own pace and pickup where they previously ended. The School will design a graduation plan for each student consisting of courses to be completed for graduation. If a student is not attending the school or logging onto the online curriculum, progress towards completing the necessary courses leading towards graduation is impeded. After 105 consecutive hours of not attending school or logging onto their online courses without an approved excuse, the student will be withdrawn from the school. The home building will be notified that the student has been withdrawn.</p>

<p><strong>STUDENT HEALTH SERVICES AND REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The Board recognizes the responsibility of the schools to help protect the health of students.  Health services are an integral part of comprehensive school improvement, assisting all students to increase learning, achievement and performance.  Health services coordinate and support existing programs to assist each student in achievement of an optimal state of physical, mental and social well being.  Student health services ensure continuity and create linkages between school, home and community service providers.  The school administrator is responsible for the administration of the health program in his/her school.</p>
<p>Of necessity, school health services must be limited to the prevention and detection of health problems, referral of problems through parents to the family physicians or community health agencies and emergency care.</p>
<p>PCS shall have on file for each student an emergency medical authorization form providing information from the parent(s) on how they wish the school to proceed in the event of a health emergency involving the student and authorization for the school in case emergency action must be taken.</p>
<p>Annually, the Pickerington Local School District School Nurse, will notify parents of required immunizations per grade level and physical exams or screenings conducted on students except for vision, hearing or scoliosis.</p>

<p><strong>TESTING / ASSESSMENT PROGRAMS</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Governing Board believes that a program of group testing can provide a meaningful source of information about the adopted curriculum and overall student achievement. Therefore, the Governing Board authorizes a program of group testing in order to:</p>
<ol>
<li>evaluate strengths and weaknesses of current curriculum and instruction and to identify areas needing change;</li>
<li>compare achievement of the Schools’ students with achievement of a sample population as one means of evaluating student growth;</li>
<li>provide a degree of diagnostic instructional information to teachers about the group(s) of students with whom they work;</li>
<li>provide general information about a student’s probable aptitude for school-related tasks and</li>
<li>provide one basis for a longitudinal study of student achievement and proficiency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Information gained through the use of group tests is used to design educational opportunities for students to better meet their individual and collective needs. The Board views such information gathering as a primary function of the public schools. Individual permission of parents is not required for the administration of these group tests.</p>
<p>The Governing Board recognizes that all tests provide only a limited source of information about an individual student. Information drawn from group tests is therefore used only in conjunction with all other information available about a student in advising the student or assisting the student in improving his/her work.</p>
<p>Each student with a disability is considered individually as to his/her participation in the testing programs.</p>
<p>Records of the results of group tests are maintained in accordance with the Governing Board’s policy on student records.</p>
<p>The administration has developed guidelines for the secure storing of testing instruments. The Pickerington Community School testing program, composed of state/federal required testing and standardized testing, is not open to students attending proprietary or parochial schools.</p>
<p>The School will administer all assessments required by the Ohio Department of Education.</p>
<p>Parents or legal guardians must be permitted to review:</p>
<ol>
<li>surveys or questions prior to their administration to the child;</li>
<li>textbooks or other instructional materials;</li>
<li>completed and graded tests taken by the child;</li>
<li>copies of statewide academic standards;</li>
<li>state-required assessment scores and/or</li>
<li>curriculum models.</li>
</ol>
<p>All certified staff will complete annual training related to Ohio Standards of Ethical Assessment Practice.</p>

<p><strong>TRUANCY</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Board endeavors to reduce truancy through diligent monitoring of student attendance, cooperation with parents and a close working relationship with the Juvenile Court system.</p>
<p>When a student has been truant and the parent(s), guardian or other person having care of a child has failed to ensure the child’s attendance at school, the Board has authority under State law, to require the parent(s) of such a student to attend a specified educational program. This program is to be developed in accordance with rules adopted by the State Board of Education for the purpose of encouraging parental involvement in compelling the child’s attendance at school. The Board authorized its building administrators to use assignment to these programs as an option in reducing truancy.</p>
<p>At the request of the Superintendent, or when it comes to the attention of the school attendance officer or other appropriate officer of the District, the designated officer must investigate any case of supposed truancy within the District. The designated officer must warn the child, if found truant, and the child’s parent(s), in writing, of the legal consequences of being a “habitual” or a “chronic” truant.</p>
<p><u>Definitions</u></p>
<ol>
<li>A “habitual truant” is any child of compulsory school age who is absent without a legitimate excuse for five or more consecutive school days, seven or more school days in one month or 12 or more days in a school year.</li>
<li>A “chronic truant” is any child of compulsory school age who is absent without legitimate excuse for seven or more consecutive school days, 10 or more school days in one month or 15 or more school days in a school year.</li>
</ol>
<p>The parent is required to have the child attend school immediately after notification. If the parent fails to get the child to attend school, the principal will notify the county attendance officer requesting further action.</p>
<p><u>Habitual Truants and Unruly Charges</u></p>
<p>For “habitually truant” students, the building administrator, in cooperation with the attendance officer, will file a complaint in juvenile court, jointly against the child and the parent. The complaint must state that the child is an “unruly child” by virtue of being a “habitual” truant, and that the child’s parent(s) violated the School Attendance Law.</p>
<p>For the “habitually truant” student, the court may order that the child attend an alternative school, or the court may order that the child not be absent without a legitimate excuse from school for a specified number of days.</p>
<p><u>Chronic Truants and Delinquency Charges</u></p>
<p>Regarding “chronic truants,” if the parent fails to get the child to attend school and the child is considered a “chronic truant,” the building administrator, in cooperation with the attendance officer, will file a complaint jointly against the child and the parent. The complaint must state that the child is a “delinquent child” by virtue of being a “chronic truant,” and that the parent has violated the School Attendance Law.</p>
<p>The Governing Board directs the administration to develop investigation strategies that shall include:</p>
<ol>
<li>withdrawing the student from the school if the student without a legitimate excuse fails to participate in one hundred five consecutive hours of the learning opportunities offered to that student; or</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>notify the students home building that the student has been withdrawn from Pickerington Community School and needs to reenroll back at his/her home building.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Governing Board directs the administration to develop investigation strategies that may include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>providing counseling for a habitual truant;</li>
<li>where appropriate, assisting in the development of county parental and student programs for truancy prevention;</li>
<li>notifying the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or</li>
<li>requiring parents to attend an educational program for the purpose of encouraging parental involvement in compelling their child&#8217;s attendance;</li>
<li>taking appropriate legal action against the truant child and his/her parent(s).</li>
</ol>

                        <p><strong>LEGAL:<br />
</strong>ORC 3313.20; 3313.753</p>
<p><strong>ADOPTION DATE:<br />
</strong>August 10, 2015</p>
<p><strong>USE OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICES BY STUDENTS</strong></p>
<p>A &#8220;wireless communication device&#8221; (WCD) is a device that emits an audible signal, vibrates, displays a message, or otherwise summons or delivers a communication to the possessor. The following devices are examples of WCDs: cellular and wireless telephones, pagers/beepers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), BlackBerry/Smartphones, iPhones, laptops, tablets, WiFi-enabled or broadband access devices, two-way radios or video broadcasting devices, and other devices that allow a person to record and/or transmit (on either a real time or delayed basis) sound, video or still images, text, or other information.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<ol>
<li>Students may possess WCDs in school, on school property, during after-school activities (e.g. extracurricular activities), at school-related functions, and on school vehicles. During these times, the WCDs must be powered off or set on silent. The requirement that WCDs must be completely powered off or silent will not apply in the following circumstances when the student obtains prior approval from a building administrator or teacher:
<ol>
<li>The student is a member of a volunteer fire company/department, ambulance or rescue squad;</li>
<li>The student has a special health circumstance (e.g. an ill family member or his/her own special health condition);</li>
<li>The student is using the WCD for an educational or instructional purpose with the teacher’s permission and supervision; or</li>
<li>Other circumstances that the building administrator and/or teacher deems significant.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Students may use WCDs as long as they do not create a distraction, disruption or otherwise interfere with the educational environment or after-school activities. Classroom teachers will determine appropriate use of WCDs during class time. Classroom teachers may ask students to power off their devices at any time.</li>
<li>Students may not use WCDs on school property or at a school-sponsored activity to access and/or view Internet websites that are otherwise blocked to students at school.</li>
<li>Students may use WCDs while riding (a) to and from school on a school bus or other vehicle provided by the Board, or (b) on a school bus or Board-provided vehicle during school-sponsored activities. The bus driver or PLSD staff member (e.g. teacher, activity sponsor, advisor, coach) has the right to ask any student to turn off his/her WCD. Distracting behavior that creates an unsafe environment will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Students are prohibited from using WCDs to capture, record or transmit the words (i.e. audio) and/or images (i.e., pictures/video) of any student, staff member or other person while in the school or attending a school-related activity without express prior notice and consent for the capture, recording or transmission of such words or images. Using a WCD to capture, record, or transmit audio and/or pictures/video of an individual without his/her consent is considered an invasion of privacy and is not permitted, unless authorized by a staff member or the building principal. Posting such pictures or videos on the Internet or any public forum may violate federal law and may be met with school discipline.</li>
<li>Students are prohibited from using a WCD in any way that might reasonably create in the mind of another person an impression of being threatened, bullied, humiliated, harassed, embarrassed or intimidated. See Board Policy JFCF and Student Handbook Part III, #19 (Hazing and Bullying).</li>
<li>Students are prohibited from using a WCD to capture and/or transmit test information or any other information in a manner constituting fraud, theft, cheating, or academic dishonesty. Likewise, students are prohibited from using their WCDs to receive such information.</li>
<li>WCDs have wi-fi and networking capabilities. Students should be aware that if their WCD connects with District resources, the District may receive data transmitted from the student’s WCD. The District reserves the right to review any data that passes through its network as a result of the student’s use of a WCD. No expectation of confidentiality will exist when accessing the District’s networks through a WCD or using WCDs on school premises/property.</li>
<li>Students may use personal laptops or laptops provided by the District on school property for educational purposes as approved by the building administrator or Superintendent and in accordance with the District’s acceptable use policy and regulations (EDE-1 and EDE-1-REG).</li>
<li>Possession of a WCD by a student is a privilege that may be forfeited by any student who fails to abide by the terms of this policy, or otherwise engages in misuse of this privilege.</li>
<li>Students are personally and solely responsible for the care and security of their WCDs. The Board assumes no responsibility for theft, loss, damage, or vandalism to WCDs brought onto its property, or the unauthorized use of such devices.</li>
<li>Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action and/or confiscation of the WCD. The building principal may also refer the matter to law enforcement if the violation involves an illegal activity. Discipline will be imposed on an escalating scale ranging from a warning to an expulsion based on the number of previous violations and/or the nature of or circumstances surrounding a particular violation. If the WCD is confiscated, it will be released/returned to the student or the student’s parent/guardian depending on the circumstances of the offense.</li>
<li>Parents/Guardians are advised that the best way to get in touch with their child during the school day is by calling the school office.</li>
