Courses eligible for the pass/fail option are identified on the <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pass-Fail-1_24_17.pdf" target="_blank">pass/fail registration form</a>. The student, his/her parent, and the teacher must complete and sign a <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pass-Fail-1_24_17.pdf" target="_blank">pass/fail registration form</a>. Interested students may secure this form in the Counselor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>1. &#8220;Electives&#8221; are defined on the <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pass-Fail-1_24_17.pdf" target="_blank">pass/fail registration form</a> that students must complete.</p>
<p>2. Students in grades <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1135464152"><span class="aQJ">9-12 may</span></span> take up to one (1) elective credit per year as Pass/Fail (in addition to P.E.) in all areas excluding core classes and foreign languages. PE classes may always be taken pass/fail and may be an additional pass/fail class beyond the student&#8217;s pass/fail course selection.</p>
<p>3. Foreign Languages will only be considered an &#8220;elective&#8221; and eligible for pass/fail if, after a student has completed at least two years of a foreign language and wants to attempt a different foreign language.</p>
<p>3. Registration for a pass/fail course must be made during the first four (4) weeks of a course. Should a student decide later to take the course as a grade option (A, B, C, D, F), he/she must do so by the end of the final grading period. For students choosing the grade option (A, B, C, D, F), only the final grade will be changed. If a student elects to change a pass/fail course to a letter grade, this will count as his/her one pass/fail selection for the school year.</p>
<p>5. The procedure for adding or dropping a course shall also apply to pass/fail courses.</p>
<p>6. A grade of satisfactory (pass) or unsatisfactory (fail) will be given for progress in each grading period. The teacher should record all letter grades as usual in his/her grade book. Pass/fail will be recorded only on grade cards and permanent record cards.</p>
<p>7. Given extenuating circumstances, pass/fail grading may be utilized in grades 6-8 as determined by the building principal in consultation with the teaching staff and by approval of the Superintendent/designee for all classes that are not for high school credit.</p>
<p>8. English Learners (EL) students (K-12) may take any class pass/fail as long as recommended by the appropriate teaching staff and by approval of the Superintendent/designee</p>

<p><b>Credit Recovery</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a self-guided, computer-based program that will allow a student to earn credits in areas where the student has previously been unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><b>New Credit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> courses are </span>only<span style="font-weight: 400;"> available to students on an approved early graduation plan or with approval of the Director of Secondary Instruction.</span></p>
<p>Courses <span style="font-weight: 400;">will vary in terms of the hourly requirements needed to complete a course. Each course will be worth ½ to 1 (0.5 – 1.0) Carnegie units. There are ways for a student to accelerate progress by pre-testing out of some units. Students will be able to take as many credits as they want during the session but will not be permitted to work on more than one course at a time.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration will be on a first-come basis, although students who should have graduated in June 2016 will be given the first priority of placement.

No actual credit is attached for interscholastic athletics and cheerleading. Students still must complete 20 credits to graduate.</p>
<p>A student shall be able to participate in this program provided he or she brings evidence of participation signed by either the athletic or band director and the school principal/designee documenting participation in one or two full seasons of an interscholastic athletic team, marching band, or cheerleading.</p>
<p>Interscholastic athletics shall comprise any sport that has the approval and is sanctioned by the Board and the Ohio High School Athletic Association.

<p>Completion of a season will mean that a student has participated in the entire length of a season. A partial participation shall be considered as not completing the season. Any student who is injured during said season and is unable to participate in at least 50% of the season shall be considered as not completing the season. If a student is removed, quits or becomes academically ineligible during the season, said student shall forfeit the option of using that activity as partial fulfillment of the Replacement of Physical Education Policy. Any student who fails to meet the 2-season requirement shall be required to complete the one-half credit of Physical Education before graduating.</p>
<p>In order to graduate from the Pickerington Schools a student must have earned a total of 20 credits.</p>

<li>to balance classes between semesters/trimesters;</li>
<li>to accommodate a senior who may need to make a change to meet graduation requirements;</li>
<li>to adjust for courses completed, with a passing grade, in summer school or through correspondence;</li>
<li>to drop a study hall and add a class;</li>
<li>to accommodate an original request that was not honored due to a scheduling conflict;</li>
<li>to change the teacher – only if the student has had the teacher previously for the same course and he/she failed that course;</li>
<li>to adjust for special/alternative programming; or</li>
<li>to change an inappropriate course level as dictated by the prerequisite.</li>
</ol>
<p>B. After the first ten days of school Schedule changes made after the first ten days of school must be approved by the parent, teacher, counselor, and building administrator. Courses will be dropped and/or added within this timeframe if space is available with counselor and administrative approved for the following reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. Adding a course:</strong> After the first ten days of a semester/trimester, no courses will be added with the exception of students enrolled in a CCP class. Students who drop a CCP class in accordance with the post secondary partner&#8217;s timeline should be permitted to add the HS equivalent if it is required for graduation. The student is responsible for making up missed material.</p>
<p><strong>2. Dropping a course:</strong> Before dropping a course, students must complete the <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Course_Level_Change-Form-1_25_17.pdf" target="_blank">Course Drop Request Form/Procedure</a>. Upon receipt of a Drop Request Form it must be determined: (1) whether the student is passing or failing. The teacher makes this determination by averaging the grades from all preceding grading periods, including the current grading period, to arrive at a cumulative grade; and, (2) whether or not the course has passed the midway point of the semester/trimester or year depending upon the length of the course. When both of these determinations have been made, the following will apply: Before the course is midway through, the following criteria will be applied for all high school courses:</p>
<p>a. Before the course is midway through, the following criteria will be applied for all high school courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the cumulative grade is a D- or above, the student will receive an F for the current grading period and a WDP (Withdraw Passing) for the remainder of the course.</li>
<li>If the cumulative grade is an F, the student will receive an F for the current grading period and a WDF (Withdraw Failing) for the remainder of the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>b. For students in grades 9-12, after the midway point of the course, the following criteria will be applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon receipt of the request to drop, the student will receive an F in the current grading period and, regardless of whether the cumulative grade is passing or failing, a WDF (Withdraw Failing) will be the grade for the remainder of the course.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Level change:</strong> A level change means moving up or down a level within the same subject area course. Once a student, parent and/or teacher recognize that the level of difficulty is not appropriate, a level change should occur immediately. Students wishing to change levels shall complete the appropriate <a href="http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Course_Level_Change-Form-1_25_17.pdf" target="_blank">Course Level Request Form/Procedures</a> before a level change will be permitted.</p>

                        <p>Credit flexibility applies to any coursework, assessment or performance completed outside of traditional high school course offerings. If a student is using credit flexibility to receive transcripted credit, he/she must receive approval from the Credit Flexibility Committee prior to starting any credit flex experience.</p>
<p>Credit awarded through this process will be posted on the student’s transcript and count toward a student’s grade point average, class rank, and as graduation credit in required subject areas or as an elective.</p>
<p>Students may demonstrate proficiency through the test-out process or they may propose an educational option that demonstrates course proficiency.</p>
