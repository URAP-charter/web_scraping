The students will volunteer at a number of different local charities and non-profits giving back to their community in a variety of ways. They will also plan, organize and run fundraisers to benefit these organizations.  We meet once a month and offer the choice of before or after school.  Club Hope is just as dedicated to the students at North as it is the community, working through all of its events to make the students more dynamic and teach them important values they can take with them wherever they go in life.</p>

                        <p>Parents,</p>
<p>If your son/daughter is interested in joining Drug Free Clubs of America at Pickerington HS North, they need to complete the application with the fee and turn it into the main office by Wednesday October 7. The application was mailed home a few weeks ago and students were also given a copy in their 3rd period class. If you need another application form, there are extras in the main office and student officers will be in each lunch period passing them out to those interested.</p>
<p>The first year of having this club at PHSN was a huge success where we had 274 students voluntarily sign up to be drug tested. Each member will receive a photo ID card in the near future and receive school and community incentives for staying drug free!</p>
<p>You can also sign your child up online by going to the link below and you can view some of the rewards that our members receive within the community.</p>

                        <p>Eco Club is about becoming more award of the ecosystems around us in a fun interesting way.  At meetings, we discuss upcoming events and brainstorm ideas for ways to fundraise and bring awareness to the ecosystem.  Last year, we started a recycling system in the cafeteria and cleaned up the outside area outside of the cafeteria.  This upcoming year, there is a possibility of taking a trip on the weekend to the zoo or the Franklin Park Conservatory.  As a club, we like to be open about ideas and make everyone feel like they have a say.  Even if you aren’t super interested about the ecosystem, we are confident that you will enjoy being in the club.  Hope to see you there!</p>

                        <p>The Junior State chapter is the most fundamental part of the organization. The vast majority of a student’s involvement in JSA takes place at the chapter level. JSA chapters have a huge impact on the lives of high school students and have an equally meaningful impact on their high school campuses and communities. In more than 500 high schools across the nation, JSA chapters are recognized as the place to go for students who are interested in politics.<br />
A strong JSA chapter attracts liberals, conservatives, moderates and even people who don’t know where they fall on the political spectrum. The lively debates, stimulating discussions and engaging activities let students express their opinions while learning about the issues. The student leaders of the chapter gain valuable skills as they build and run the club. School administrators and faculty recognize the chapter augments the social studies curricula and is an addition to the civic-education mission of their school.<br />
Junior State chapters are school-sponsored extracurricular clubs. They must have a teacher/advisor and at least eight members and follow the regulations of their high school. Junior State chapters hold regular meetings on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Visit to the Starting A Chapter section of this site for information on bringing JSA to your school.</p>

                        <p>There are several key Yearbook events happening in the next week, so I wanted to take an opportunity to let you know what important things are going on.</p>
<p>First, the base price of $65 for the yearbook expires at the end of the day tomorrow, Friday the 2nd. Starting on Saturday, yearbooks will be $70. If you have not ordered your book, please act quickly to ensure you receive the base price. All ordering is done through www.smart-pay.com.</p>
<p>Along with this, starting Monday, December 5, the yearbook editors will be raffling off ten candy bouquets. Anyone who has bought a book by Monday the 5th will be entered in the raffle. We will hold one raffle each school day through Friday, December 16th, so there will be ten winners. </p>
<p>Next Friday, December 9th, is our annual club/group picture day. Students will be receiving specific information throughout the next week, but if they are a part of a school club/group, they will need to see their adviser for a pass. This pass will allow them to get out of class for the group picture. </p>
<p>December 9th is also the day that seniors will take their portrait for the yearbook. This year, we are asking all seniors to take a photo on the 9th to ensure consistency throughout the portrait section. Seniors will be excused during part of their English class to get their portrait taken. Any senior who attends a career center will have an opportunity later in the year to get their senior portrait. </p>
<p>Finally, the editors are holding a &#8220;cover picture contest&#8221; as they gather photos for a collage on our cover. Students are encouraged to submit pictures to the yearbook email account (phsn_yearbook@plsd.us). The photos should be close-up shots of students&#8217; faces, as we hope to capture the individual personalities of our students. In addition to being featured on the cover, the students whose pictures are selected will receive a $5 discount/refund on the purchase of their book. </p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions. My direct line at the school is 614-830-2752, and my email address is ben_baptist@plsd.us.</p>

                        <p>This is a nation wide organization that has branches in 46 states. Each state has a conference in the spring where students go to form and act out the three branches of government in their statehouse. Last year, Pickerington North was represented by four students at the state assembly, and two students at the national assembly. This conference is a very rewarding experience, because not only students really get a strong understanding of how government works, but they also get to meet people from all across Ohio and understand different viewpoints, perspectives, and ideas. </p>
