                        <p>Dear Families:</p>
<p>Out PTO sponsored Father/Daughter event was held on Friday, February 17, 2017 at our school. Aryn Goslee and Lisa Winters planned a Candyland themed evening for the girls and their special guests. Thank you to everyone who helped make the event a success, especially Mrs. Goslee and Mrs. Winters.</p>
<p>Seven students were chosen as school leaders for the month of January. Each of the students was nominated by a staff member for demonstrating one of the seven habits described in the book The Leader in Me by Stephen R. Covey, and in the series of books titled The 7 Habits of Happy Kids by Sean Covey. Each student demonstrated what a highly effective leader looks like and were recognized during the February 15, 2017 PTO meeting. During the meeting, the selected students received a leadership T-shirt, a certificate, and a charm. Congratulations to the following students: Sasha B, Lily R, Holten Y, Kiran O-A, Gracie S, Joeseanna H, and Walker F.</p>
<p>On behalf of the entire staff, we wish all of our families a relaxing week during our upcoming Spring Break, March 20-24, 2017, and we&#8217;ll look forward to having students back in the building on Monday, March 27, 2017.</p>

                        <p>Prior to testing in March and April, School Counselor, Lisa Lowe will visit each third and fourth-grade classroom to review test taking strategies and tips.  Students will also learn strategies for test anxiety and yoga poses they can practice in their chair to help them relax and refocus during the text.  Please look for more information regarding my March classroom visits within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Please note that testing will begin at 9:30 AM sharp.  If possible, please schedule appointments in the afternoon on these days.</p>

                        <p>As we learn to incorporate the increased usage of electronic devices in our schools, we must make some adjustments to keep children safe from posts, applications, and sites that they should not see. With a recent change of restrictions within YouTube, we have removed that option from all district owned, student iPads in the elementary buildings.</p>
<p>Since our district is moving towards 1:1 devices for all students, all elementary buildings will institute a guideline requiring students to keep personal devices, such as cell phones and iPads, off and in their book bags during school hours. This also applies to recess, whether indoor or outdoor.</p>

                        <p>Dear Families:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting to share that during our January PTO meeting, 14 students were recognized for being chosen as school leaders, seven for the month of November and seven for the month of December. Each of the fourteen students were nominated by a staff member for demonstrating one of the seven habits described in the book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Leader in Me</span> by Stephen R. Covey and in the series of books titled <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The 7 Habits of Happy Kids</span> by Sean Covey. Each student demonstrated what a highly effective leader looks like. During the meeting, the students were given a leadership T-shirt, a certificate, and a charm. Congratulations to the following students: <strong>November:</strong> Habit 1 &#8211; Oliva C, Habit 2 &#8211; Trayven C, Habit 3 &#8211; Ava Marie D, Habit 4 &#8211; Elijah W, Habit 5 &#8211; Isabella C, Habit 6 &#8211; Ivan K, Habit 7 &#8211; Addie G. <strong>December:</strong>  Habit 1 &#8211; Faith B, Habit 2 &#8211; Jonathan C, Habit 3 &#8211; Ava C, Habit 4 &#8211; Ava W, Habit 5 &#8211; Eman M, Habit 6 &#8211; Hudson S, Habit 7 &#8211; Bella N. Great job students!</p>
<p>Our Fourth Grade Spelling Bee was held the evening of January 25, 2017. Congratulations to our winner, Peter Perkins, and our runner-up Andrew Worth. Peter will represent our school at the Regional Bee in Lancaster on March 18. Good luck Peter!</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support, and helping us establish a positive learning climate. Stay warm as the weather turns colder, and stay involved with your child&#8217;s education!</p>

These individual screenings (called Bracken assessments) are performed by trained district educators. They are only used by the district to help teachers determine where to begin teaching individual children.</p>
<p>The Bracken assessment tests children on skills such as identifying common colors by name, identifying upper case and lower case letters, identifying single and double-digit numbers, counting objects, demonstrating a basic knowledge of words used to depict size, identifying shapes, and matching or differentiating objects based on specific characteristics.</p>

Soon, the in-school dentist will be at our school! Enrollment forms will be sent home with your child this week. To take advantage of this convenient opportunity and have your child see the dentist at school, please fill out and sign the enrollment form and return it to the school with your child. If you have not received a form, please contact the school today and ask for one to be sent home with your child. Together, we can keep our children healthy, in-school and learning.</p>

                        <p>We had a wonderful turnout for our November KISS luncheons, just as in years past. Many family members shared that they were so appreciative of the opportunity to enjoy a short activity or program prior to lunch, and to spend time there at school during lunch too. Families who are new to Pickerington Elementary also mentioned that they loved our luncheons! Our book fair was open during the same time frame and was also very well attended during the luncheons. If you didn&#8217;t receive an invitation for a November luncheon, you child will have a luncheon in March, and you will receive an invitation approximately two weeks before the event. Thank you to everyone who attended, to our teachers for opening up their classrooms, to our students who were greeters and guides, and to our PTO members who helped set up and serve during the luncheons, and worked our book fair.</p>
<p>As we enter the holiday season, we&#8217;re thankful for our wonderful students, staff and families at Pickerington Elementary. The entire staff wishes you a safe and restful holiday break!</p>

                        <p>Before the end of this year, parents should replace the current &#8220;bus tracker&#8221; mobile application with Petermann Transportation&#8217;s new and improved version.</p>
<p>Petermann Transportation has updated its mobile app, which parents  can use to track their children&#8217;s buses. The new version can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.petermannbus.com/Pages/PetermannBusTracker.aspx.">http://www.petermannbus.com/Pages/PetermannBusTracker.aspx.</a> Parents will need their students ID numbers to set up the app.</p>
<p>The new app improves functionality from the old version, including giving Petermann Transportation the ability to communicate directly with parents about bus delays and other issues.</p>
<p>Parents are reminded they should not use the system to wait until the very last minute to send their children to the bus stop. Students must be at their designated stop by the scheduled bus arrival time, and waiting until the last minute can be dangerous if children are running to the bus. The system operates by tracking the GPS units in each bus. so it operates on a lag that can be up to two minutes. During that time, the bus may have made progress on its route, so GPS locations are only approximate.</p>

<p><strong>STEM Day</strong> &#8211; Our second annual STEM Day was held on Friday, October 14, and was a tremendous success! To launch STEM day, the entire student body gathered outside to observe science behind balloon flight. They watched the crew inflate the balloon envelope with a fan, then use propane burners to heat the air, launching it into flight. Students also learned about drones, ultrasound technology, fire fighting technology, and our district’s own BioSTEM opportunities. Once they were back in their classrooms, students all participated in a grade appropriate STEM challenge. Families, if you haven’t asked your kids about this day, please do so. They’ll have lots to share.</p>
<p>This day wouldn’t have been possible without a number of volunteers who gave of their time and expertise. Thank you to Ted Saneholtz &amp; his volunteer crew with FTK Adventures for the hot air balloon, Dave King and Beth King with Rentasky for sharing the drone, OSU’s Department of Emergency Medicine, David Way, and Cindy Chang for the ultrasound session, firefighters and medics from the Violet Township Fire Station, and our district’s own Andy Harris and his biomedical STEM students, several of whom were graduates of Pickerington Elementary! Thank you to our supportive PTO for providing monetary and volunteer support, and to fourth grade teacher, Sarah Burre, for coordinating and organizing our fabulous STEM Day!</p>

                        <p><strong>Notes</strong> &#8211; Please remember, when possible, to send notes in with your children when they will be leaving early for appointments. This allows the teachers to be prepared and to have them ready to go at the designated time. Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>Cold Weather Preparations</strong> &#8211; Students continue to go outside during the winter months when weather permits. Children should always come to school prepared for outside recess, wearing coats, hats, gloves, etc. Remember to listen to your radio or watch television weather-related school closings and delayed openings. You may also sign up for text alerts by going to the Pickerington Local School District website and following the directions. On a two (2) hour delay, morning kindergarten times are 11:15 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and afternoon kindergarten is from 1:55 p.m. to 3:40 p.m.</p>

                        <p><strong>Clothing</strong> &#8211; We really appreciate the clothing that parents have donated to the clinic. Thank you for your generosity. We&#8217;re still low on boys pants, especially those with elastic waistbands. We could use all sizes, but sizes 7-12 in particular. If you have any that your child has outgrown, feel free to send them our way!</p>
<p>Also, if your child has borrowed clothing from the clinic, please wash and return them.</p>
<p><strong>Who Should be Vaccinated for Flu?</strong> &#8211; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that the vaccination is given to those people who are at an increased risk of influenza complications. These include:<br />
-People age 65 and older;<br />
-Children ages six (6) months to 23 months;<br />
-Anyone with a chronic medical condition, such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease or lung disease;<br />
-Anyone with an immune disorder.<br />
Also, the CDC recommends vaccination for people in close contact with those at increased risk of complications, for medical personnel and for anyone else who wants to minimize the risk of getting the flu.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Care of a Cold</strong> &#8211; Most people get several colds a year. You cannot completely avoid them, but you can reduce the changes by keeping your hands away from your face and washing your hands frequently. The common cold is caused by viruses and lasts 7-14 days. It usually starts with a sore throat, sneezing, and runny nose. You may have a mild fever or headache, stuffy nose, and thicker yellowish mucous. Stuffy ears and sinus pressures around the eyes, forehead, and cheekbones may develop.</p>
<p><strong>What can I do to feel better? </strong><br />
-Get enough sleep to feel rested;<br />
-Drink plenty of fluids, especially hot ones;<br />
-Gargle with warm salt water to soothe a sore throat;<br />
-Breathe the steam from a hot shower, or drink a hot beverage or soup<br />
-Avoid smoke and other irritants.<br />

                        <p>Parents  often have trouble knowing whether their child is too ill to go to school. The following guidelines will help you decide.</p>
<p>Your child is too ill to go to school if he/she has any of the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seems very tired and needs bed rest (this is common with flu symptoms</li>
<li>Has vomiting and diarrhea</li>
<li>Becomes short of breath or has an increase in wheezing during normal activity.</li>
<li>Has a cough that interrupts his normal activity</li>
<li>Has a temperature above 100 degrees by mouth</li>
<li>Has moderate to severe pain from earache, headache, sore throat, or recent injury</li>
<li>Has yellow or green drainage from the eye(s).</li>
<li>Breaks out in a rash</li>
</ul>
<p>Fever</p>
<ul>
<li>Your child should not go to school if his temperature is above 100 degrees. He or she may return to school 24 hours after his temperature is below 100 degrees without the use of fever-reducing medication, such as Tylenol or Motrin, and he or she is feeling better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contagious Disease</p>
<ul>
<li>A contagious disease is one that can be spread by close contact with a person or object. Examples of contagious diseases are: chickenpox, the flu with vomiting or diarrhea, colds, &#8220;runny nose,&#8221; strep throat, and &#8220;pinkeye.&#8221; A disease is most often contagious <strong>24 hours before the child shows signs of illness</strong>. It is very hard to prevent the spread of some germs, especially in a school classroom. <strong>Good hand washing will help prevent the spread of germs</strong>.</li>
<li>Your child should stay home from school if he or she has a contagious disease to keep from spreading it to others.</li>
<li>If your child has chickenpox or strep throat, ask your doctor when he or she may return to school. Generally, children who have active chickenpox should not return to school until all the lesions are dried and crusted. Children with strep throat should be on antibiotics for 24 hours and have no fever before returning to school.</li>
<li>If an antibiotic medicine is prescribed for your child, be sure he has taken the medicine for at least 24 hours before returning to school. Remember &#8211; the antibiotic medicine should be taken as prescribed until it is all gone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please remember</p>
<ul>
<li>School is a child&#8217;s work. It is important for normal development. If your child is absent often, it may be harder to keep up with the class. It is important that your child does not miss more than a few days of school a year due to illness.</li>
<li>Ask your doctor when you are not sure about keeping your child home.</li>
</ul>

                        <p>Greetings Families!</p>
<p>The 2016-2017 school year is off to a great start. Pickerington Elementary was one of two elementary schools that was fortunate enough to go &#8220;1 to 1&#8243; Technology. Each of our students has an electronic device; either iPad mini or iPad for use on a daily basis. This allows students and teachers to use technology in various ways throughout the day to enhance learning through whole group or small group instruction, learning stations or independent work. If you ever have any curriculum concerns, feel free to contact me at school.</p>
<p>Encourage your child to use the following Technology Resources at home this month!</p>
<ul>
<li>ST Math</li>
<li>Reading Eggs (K-2)</li>
<li>Reading A to Z</li>
<li>Google Classroom (if your child&#8217;s teacher has introduced them to this)</li>
<li>Encourage your child to read his/her AR (Accelerated Reader) Books and take tests at school when done.</li>

                        <p>Once again this year, third and fourth graders will be able to participate in the Newbery Book Club. This club encourage great reading! Students just need to read a Newbery Medal winning book or a Newbery Honor book (both on display in our library). After reading a Newbery selection, and AR test must be passed for the book to count. We will gather for lunch once a month and celebrate at the end of the year. Happy Reading!</p>

                        <p>Dear Families,</p>
<p>Are your children ready to start back to school? We hope so, because we&#8217;re looking forward to welcoming them back.</p>
<p>If you are new to our school or the community, we truly hope you&#8217;ll like it here. Our school and district have a positive reputation, and we presume that is one of the reason you chose to move here. During the 2013-2014 school year, our school received the &#8220;Hall of Fame&#8221; Award, only one of six schools in the State of Ohio to do so. We will continue to work hard for our students and families to show that we are indeed, an exemplary school.</p>
<p>We hope you are able to join us for the &#8220;Meet the Teacher&#8221; and curriculum meetings scheduled for your child&#8217;s grade level on Friday, August 12, 2016. We will also have our annual Title I Meeting the same evening at two different times, 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. in our cafeteria. In addition, be sure to mark your calendar for our PTO&#8217;s Welcome Back Party on Thursday, September 1 from 6:00 &#8211; 8:00 p.m. We hope to see many of your here at school the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>As always, if you ever need to speak to me, your child&#8217;s teacher, our school counselor, or any other staff member, please call the school office at (614) 548-1400.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to another great year!</p>
<p>Melissa Moriarty, Principal</p>

                        <p>We would like to thank everyone in advance for your cooperation in following our procedures for arrival and dismissal of student. With an enrollment of 450 students, being accountable for safety, as well as the academic program, takes much effort from the school, parents and students. Together we can make it work.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MORNING ARRIVAL</strong></span></p>
<p>This year, in all of our elementary buildings, the buses will be unloading a 9:05 a.m. While we encourage parents to send children to school on the bus, if you are dropping of your child in the morning, please adhere as closely as possible to the 9:05 a.m. time. Since school does not begin until 9:15 a.m., we believe this provides plenty of time for our children to get to their rooms. Students will not be permitted to go to their classrooms until 9:05 a.m.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A</strong><strong>FTERNOON DISMISSAL</strong></span></p>
<p>Each day as school ends, we dismiss the same 450 students. We have buses, cars and daycare vans picking up children.</p>
<p>We will use the following procedures for dismissal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Children who are being picked up will wait on the West, Diley Road side of the building with an adult on duty.</li>
<li>If you are picking up your child, please remain in your car, following the arrows on the parking lot blacktop. Your child will be released to your vehicle.</li>
<li>Bus riders are dismissed to board the buses that are parked in the bus lane in front of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p>The teacher and the office need to be notified of any changes that will occur at dismissal.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your help in allowing our arrival and dismissal procedures to operate smoothly.</p>

                        <p>During the course of this school year, it may become necessary to send the children home due to an emergency. This could be caused by weather, electrical outage, or other types of emergencies as determined by emergency personnel. These emergency situations occur suddenly, leaving no time for parent notification other than radio announcement. In such an emergency, your child needs to know ahead of time what to do. Please talk with them about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they know how to enter the home?</li>
<li>Do they go to the neighbors?</li>
<li>Who do they call when they arrive home?</li>
<li>Do they have a list of phone numbers?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, our phone system does not operate during electrical outages and having your child wait at school to be picked up is not an option if we are told to evacuate by emergency personnel.</p>
<p>Please take the time to talk with your child and help us keep your child safe!</p>
