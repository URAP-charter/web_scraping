                        <p>Pickerington Schools uses the online payment system <a href="https://www.mypaymentsplus.com/" target="_blank">My Payments Plus</a> as a safe, secure and convenient way to allow parents to pay for their children’s meals. With a My Payments Plus account, you can take advantage of other free benefits of the site, such as low-balance e-mail notifications and even the ability to download the free MyPaymentsPlus mobile app, which is available for all iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android devices. The mobile app will also allow for you to set up push notifications regarding your student’s balance.</p>
<p>Through the system, parents can check their children’s cafeteria balances and purchase histories, make prepayments for breakfast and lunch with auto-pay capability, and receive email reminders if account balances get low.</p>
<p>We highly encourage you to at least set up an account so you can be included in any direct messaging from our nutrition department.</p>
<p>Thank you for partnering with us in an effort to make managing your student’s account easy and the fall transition a smooth one.</p>

                        <p><u><b></b></u>Negative balance notices are sent home with elementary children weekly. Balances may also be checked at any time at <a href="http://www.MyPaymentsPlus.com" target="_blank">www.MyPaymentsPlus.com</a> or by calling the Food Service Office at 614.833.3645. You will need your student&#8217;s pin number to check balances.</p>
<p>In addition to paying for student meals through MyPayments Plus, Pickerington Schools also accepts checks and cash for payment of meals. Make checks payable to Pickerington Food Service Department. Please include child’s name and ID# on the check.</p>
<p>While high school, junior high and middle school students are not permitted to charge, children in grades 1 thru 4 may charge up to $7.05 which is equal to 3 lunches. No extra items may be charged and no breakfast may be charged. When the student has reached the charge limit of $7.05, meals may be denied.</p>
<p>Elementary School students may charge up to $7.05, or the equivalent of three student lunches. After charging $7.05, students will be denied a student lunch.</p>
<p>Middle school, junior high, and high school students may not charge lunches.</p>
<p>During the final two weeks of school, no charging for meals is allowed. If your student has a negative balance, or a balance not high enough to cover the cost of a lunch, the balance must be paid or increased before the student receives lunch. If an elementary student has a negative balance, or less than $2.35, they will receive a cheese sandwich and juice.</p>
<p>No student will be allowed to receive a full student lunch if he/she does not have enough money in their account (or cash of a money order) to pay for a meal. Grade cards may be held for any students with negative balances.</p>

                        <p><strong>Setting up low-balance email notifications and auto payments online</strong></p>
<p>Step one: Log-in to your account at: <a href="http://www.mypaymentsplus.com/" target="_blank">www.MyPaymentsPlus.com</a></p>
<p>Step two: Each of the customized settings have a button pertaining to that setting. Those buttons are “Low Balance Notifications,” “Auto Pay,” “Online Payment History,” and “Purchase History.”</p>
<p>Step three: By clicking either the “Low-Balance Notifications” button or the “Auto-Pay button,” you will then enter the dollar amount that you want to outline as the “lowest amount” your student’s account will hit before a low-balance e-mail notification or auto-payment is processed.</p>
<p>Step four: If your school offers both “Meal” and “General” accounts for their cafeteria deposits, be sure to click the box for the desired account in which you are referring to. (As a reminder, Meal accounts allow for one plated meal per lunch/breakfast, whereas the General account enables the student to eat multiple meals and a la carte options.)</p>
<p>Step five: Be sure to click “Save Changes” when you are finished.</p>

<p>Children receiving SNAP (formerly food stamps) or OWF are eligible for free meal benefits. If your total household income is the same or less than the amounts shown on the income chart, your child may receive free or reduced-price meals. A foster child is eligible to receive free meals regardless of your household income. If you receive WIC your child may be eligible for meal benefits. Please fill out an application. Homeless, runaway, and migrant children receive free meals. Please call the school or your homeless or migrant coordinator to see if your child(ren) qualify. You may apply even if you or your child(ren) are not a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>When filling out an application you must include all people living in your household, related or not (such as grandparents, other relatives, or friends.) You must include yourself and all children who live with you. You must include income from everyone living in the household, related or not. Call 866-711-7341 to check to see if your child&#8217;s application is approved. We will notify you in writing only if your application is denied.</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong> School officials may ask you at any time during the school year to provide proof of eligibility.</p>
<p><b>Fair Hearing:</b> Contact Pickerington Food Services if you do not agree with the decision on your application or the results of verification. If you are not satisfied after speaking to Food Service, you may ask for a fair hearing by writing Vince Utterback, Business Manager, Pickerington Schools, 90 East St., Pickerington, OH 43147, or by calling 614-833-2110.</p>

<p><b>Confidentiality:</b> Food Service will provide information about your child&#8217;s eligibility to other school officials. This information is used to determine if your child is eligible for a waiver of school instructional fees. <strong>On the application, p</strong><b>lease check the box &#8220;yes&#8221; if you want this information shared. Check &#8220;no&#8221; if you do not want this information shared. Please sign the waiver choice.</b> Answering the question either way will not change whether your child will get meal benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Last year&#8217;s eligibility:</strong> Children who were approved last year must have a new application approved this year to continue receiving meal benefits. New applications must be received in the Food Service office no later than September 28, 2016, or your child will be dropped from the program.</p>
<p><b>Special dietary needs:</b> All meals served in our cafeterias meet meal pattern requirements and national dietary guidelines; however, if a child has a disability that prevents eating regular school meals, we will make doctor prescribed substitutions at no extra charge. If you believe your child has special dietary needs due to a disability, you may contact Food Service Supervisor Judy Riley at 614-833-3645.</p>
<p><strong>Online applications:</strong> Online applications are now available. You may apply and submit your application for meal benefits after August 3, 2016, <a href="http://onlineapps.pickerington.k12.oh.us" target="_blank">at this link</a>.</p>
