                        <p>Pickerington Schools operate using no exclusion evidenced-based practice, which means that a student suspected or confirmed to have head lice or nits shall remain in school and is not isolated or otherwise subjected to restrictions of activities.</p>
<p>The student&#8217;s parent or guardian shall be informed that their child is suspected of being infested by head lice and will be offered information and guidance on the biology and management of the condition. It is expected that the parent or guardian will provide appropriate treatment for the condition and the student will return to school the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Management of Head Lice and Nits</strong></p>
<p>PLSD operates on a no exclusion evidenced-based practice supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Association of School Nurses.</p>
<p>Reminders to staff and parents or guardians on lice prevention and management will be sent home to families at regular intervals throughout the school year in an effort to sustain a positive attitude toward containment of head lice/nits and discourage head-to-head contact.</p>
<p>When a school staff member is notified by a parent or guardian that a student has lice, the staff member will notify the building school nurse. The school nurse will contact the parent or guardian to provide information about diagnosis and management of lice. The nurse will offer services (if needed) to support the family.</p>
<p>Confidentiality of a student with suspected or confirmed lice or nits will be maintained.</p>
<p>By the end of the school day, the school nurse will notify parents or guardians of students with suspected lice or nits by phone. The student will not be excluded from school and may be transported home by bus.</p>
<p>The school nurse and building principal shall work with the parents and guardians of any student who has been determined to have a chronic infestation of head lice. This will be done through advocating for the education of staff, students, and parents or guardians about head lice and promoting evidenced-based management for students with head lice.</p>

                        <p><strong>Encourage good hand washing.</strong> According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) the number one method for controlling the spread of disease is hand washing. Make sure you use soap, warm water, and wash all surfaces of the hands. A simple way to ensure you have washed long enough is to silently sing the “Happy Birthday” song to yourself twice while washing. Follow washing with a good rinse, pat hands dry, and use the towel to turn off the faucet to avoid getting hands dirty again. Wash hands after blowing the nose, playing with pets, before eating, after using the restroom, or when they are visible dirty.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure your child gets enough sleep each night.</strong> Children should get between nine and ten hours of sleep each night in order to feel rested. Those who do not get enough sleep are often groggy, irritable, and have decreased alertness in school. It’s easy to see how school performance and behavior are negatively affected when children are not rested.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure your child eats breakfast each day.</strong> Studies have shown that children who eat breakfast actually do better on tests, and are better able to fight off disease and infection. Breakfast should consist of wholesome nourishing foods such as cereal, fruit, juice, milk, eggs, peanut butter, toast, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Encourage your child to drink plenty of water.</strong> Many of the complaints that bring students to the clinic can be attributed to dehydration, such as headaches, stomachaches, sore throats and nosebleeds.</p>
<p><strong>Dress your child appropriately for the weather.</strong> Children who are too hot or too cold will have difficulty concentrating. During the winter months hats decrease heat loss through the head, and gloves protect against frostbite. Proper footwear should also be considered: boots during snowy times, shoes and socks during more mild weather. “Flip-flops” are never appropriate footwear for school.</p>
<p><strong>Cover your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing.</strong> Cold and flu germs are spread though the air. Covering the mouth and nose can decrease the spread of germs. Teach your student to cough/sneeze into his/ her bent elbow, thus decreasing the amount of germs in the air, and keeping the hands cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your student home if he/she has a fever.</strong> For school purposes, a fever is 100 degrees F. Your child needs to be fever free for 24 hours without the use of medication prior to returning to school. Even if your child feels better, fevers often return if he/she is sent to school too soon. Keeping your child home will also help limit the spread of disease to other students.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your student home if he/she vomits during the night.</strong> As with fevers, vomiting often occurs again if the child is sent to school too soon. Keeping him/her home allows for rest and recovery, and protects other students from exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Follow directions on medication prescribed for your child.</strong> If your child has been prescribed antibiotics or eye drops for pink eye, please make sure the medication is completed, even if your child feels or looks better. This medication must be taken in its entirety in order to ensure the condition is resolved. Failure to finish antibiotics may allow the condition to return.</p>
<p><strong>Consider your home environment.</strong> Remember the old adage: Children learn what they live. Modeling healthy behavior can help your child learn healthy habits. Children are more likely to adopt healthy behaviors such as good diet, daily exercise, and not smoking when the home environment encourages it. Also, studies have shown that second hand smoke increases the likelihood of respiratory illness in children.</p>
