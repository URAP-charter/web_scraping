                <p>The Instructional Technology Department helps improve student achievement and academic growth by integrating technology into the curriculum to increase academic opportunities. The department works closely with the Teaching and Learning Department to enhance the curriculum and to increase 21st-century technology skills of all students and all staff members.</p>
<p>The department’s goal is to ensure that every school has the infrastructure to support learning with technology. The adoption of the Pickerington Schools Technology Plan in 2016 will allow the district to move toward a One2One model, providing a device for every student in the district.</p>

<p><strong>Chromebook Care Reminders</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take good care of your new Chromebook.  You will use the same Chromebook for 4 years.</li>
<li>Carry your Chromebook with both hands.</li>
<li>Set your Chromebook on a flat surface to use it.  An example of a flat surface is a desk or table.</li>
<li>Keep food and drinks away from your Chromebook.  <em>In other words, do not eat or drink while you are using the Chromebook.  Instead, take a study break away from your Chromebook.</em></li>
<li>Never place a heavy object or a lot of objects on top of your Chromebook.</li>
<li>Charge your Chromebook every night at home.
<ul>
<li>If you close the lid of your Chromebook, you will help save the battery.</li>
<li>You can use your Chromebook when the level is low.  Just remember to charge when you get home.</li>
<li>When you plug in your Chromebook to charge it, look for the charging light indicator.  This will assure you that your Chromebook is being charged.</li>
<li>Let the Chromebook completely charge to a full battery.</li>
<li>Charging a Chromebook could take up to 4 hours.  Therefore, plug it in to charge and go do something else.</li>
</ul>

                        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Technology Planning Process</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This technology plan was created through a collaborative process with faculty, support staff, administrators, Board of Education, and the community. Members of the District Technology Committee attended meetings and work sessions between August 2013 and December 2015 to continue to develop the various components of the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In order to provide a technology program that will continue to support and enhance the educational and administrative programs in our district, the committee developed this on-going plan.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to discussions and presentations within the District Technology Committee and meetings throughout the District, a wide range of additional information was used in the development of this plan. This information included staff meetings, reviews of research, and other technology planning literature, such as the federal E-Rate planning guidelines, the ISTE planning tools, and the Partnership for 21st Century Skills framework. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Instructional Technology Department has updated its goals and redefined its mission and vision for the current and future school years.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The District established through the strategic planning process a vision, mission and belief statements, which led to the corresponding implementation plan for the next phase of technology training and acquisition that includes objectives for each area.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This planning document reflects the vision for instructional technology implementation in each critical area. For each area, the vision process will establish the District’s expectations, appropriate measures of implementation success, and implementation milestones for the upcoming school year, and existing and emerging technologies to support the goals and proposed timeline. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some examples of the questions that will be addressed as part of the vision and planning process include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">How can we encourage and train teachers to use technology in powerful ways?</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">How can data be housed and collected in a more meaning and impactful way?</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">How can teachers integrate more technology into their curriculum?</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">How can we expand our infrastructure to support all of the instructional technology needs and goals?</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">How can we provide students and staff with the appropriate number of devices?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This technology plan is intended to mesh with all Pickerington Local School District’s instructional technology and curriculum initiatives, as well as to support our District&#8217;s mission, vision and belief statements. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The plan was developed from the strong belief, supported by research, that technology can significantly enhance the learning environment and improve teaching and learning. Furthermore, technology is seen as a critical component of our efforts to adequately prepare our students. This technology plan defines the vision and objectives for continuing to move our students and the Pickerington Local School District forward in the 21st century.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The committee members recognize that as they continue planning during the ongoing technology implementation phase, they will provide support across schools in the following areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Matching devices with instructional needs and curriculum goals</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Matching software and accessory purchases with instructional needs and curriculum goals</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Creating the vision and policies to be used by schools and departments to determine how technology will be distributed to instructional areas</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Implementing and tracking the priorities for technology leases and purchases</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Providing professional development for instructional and non-instructional staff</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Evaluating the effectiveness of current and new instructional technology tools.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Possible Future Technology Impact</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Technology Committee understands that the world of technology is ever-changing and to forecast the future use of emerging technology is difficult.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With that idea the technology committee points to the following technology trends for making future recommendations.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Mobile devices continue to gain market share</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Desktop computers become less important</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Cloud based software continues to impact in usage of software and instructional technology tools</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Users expect access to information and data anytime/anywhere</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Significant growth in importance of 1:1 environments</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Students have choice between online and traditional learning</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Paperless, digital lifestyle (books, news, media, video, images, music, etc) </span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Leveraging of social media in the classrooms</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Bring your own device (BYOD) will gain importance</span></li>
<li class="p5"><span class="s1">Gamification in digital curriculum</span></li>

                        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Technology Vision</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Pickerington Local School District (PLSD) is committed to providing students with a technology rich learning environment. The Pickerington Local School District will incorporate technology as a natural part of education through an integrated, comprehensive framework to govern acquisition, application, and evaluation of technological resources to ensure that all students will have the opportunity to develop the 21st century skills necessary to be productive citizens in an information-driven, global society.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Vision</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The vision of Pickerington Local School District is to provide all students with a blended learning experience with access to technology which will assist them in:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1"> showing mastery in all of the content areas </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1"> increasing skills in critical thinking, collaboration and communication</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1"> being prepared for the next level of education</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1"> successfully attaining the skills and proficiencies required of today&#8217;s work force.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition, all administrators, teachers, and district/school staff will use technology through a blended learning approach to effectively help students attain high standards and prepare for tomorrow&#8217;s world of work.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Blended Learning</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Blended Learning is a method of instruction in which a student learns at least in part through delivery of content and instruction via digital and online media with some element of student control over time, place, path, or pace. We believe that students need a rich and wide array of instructional methods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tools that the teacher or the student uses to learn must to be the appropriate tool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some tasks may require the use of technology, some tasks may require paper and pencil, some may require the student to act out their learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a blended learning environment all of those tools and learning methods are significant to end goal of increasing student achievement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Why Technology?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the 21st century, understanding and using technology will be an integral part of virtually every aspect of daily life. It is the school system&#8217;s responsibility to prepare students for this future. The classroom is the primary place where this preparation will occur; therefore, every classroom must be equipped with technology to support teaching and learning. Every teacher must be knowledgeable and skilled in the use of these technologies in daily instruction. When integrated into instruction, technology will support new strategies for teaching and learning by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">addressing diverse learning styles,</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">accommodating individual learning rates,</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">encouraging cooperative learning,</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">helping students accept responsibility for their learning,</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">providing the means to communicate globally, and</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">improving academic achievement in all areas.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The use of technology in instruction changes the structure of the classroom. No longer should the teacher rely solely on the traditional lecture/seat work method of instruction. In a technology-rich, student-centered classroom, the teacher serves as a facilitator of instruction, mentor, and coach. Technology will provide a record of the student&#8217;s academic history and ways to manage learning progress and activities. Teachers have the data and information needed to individualize instruction and assessment as well as make other important instructional management decisions. Through technology, teachers and students will access a wealth of materials, services, and networks throughout the state, nation, and world. Technology does not replace the teacher, but rather supports and enhances the educational process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Instructional Purpose of Technology</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Integrating technology into classroom instruction means more than teaching basic computer skills and software applications in a separate computer class. Effective technology integration must happen across the curriculum in ways that research shows deepen and enhance the teaching and learning process. In particular, it must support four key components of learning: active engagement, participation in groups, frequent interaction and feedback. Effective technology integration is achieved when the use of technology is routine and transparent and when technology supports curriculum goals.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Effective technology integration to improve teaching and learning is not about the device, but how the device is used to improve both teaching and learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The instructional outcome or result is always the goal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The device is an instrument to achieve those goals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Technology can allow educators and students a new way to reach previously unreachable learning outcomes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Technology also changes the way teachers teach, offering educators effective ways to reach different types of learners and assess student understanding through multiple means. It also enhances the relationship between teacher and student. When technology is effectively integrated into subject areas, teachers grow into roles of advisor, content expert, facilitator and coach. Technology helps make teaching and learning more impactful and engaging.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Pickerington Local School District is adopting a blended learning approach to the integration of technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This approach allows teachers to combine the best teaching practice from a traditional classroom and those from a digital classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The teaching strategies should align to the goals of the learning objective.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some lessons may require the use of technology, other lessons technology may not be needed, while other lessons may need technology for part of the lesson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The end goal is to have and utilize the proper tool to enhance the curriculum and meet the instructional needs of the students.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Technology is all too often applied as an add-on to existing curriculum. To maximize its potential benefits — such as the development of higher-order thinking skills — educators must weave technology into the curriculum in such a way that the tool matches the desired learning outcome.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Connection with Teaching and Learning</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Technology and teaching &amp; learning must be a close relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When integrating technology in the classroom or curriculum there are a few questions that should be examined first:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Regardless of the technology, what’s the essential outcome the lesson?</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">How are these technology tools enhancing the curriculum?</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">What will the students do with these tools – during and after class?</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Am I using technology in a powerful way?</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">How will the use of this technology improve my teaching?</span></li>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">SAMR is a model designed to help educators infuse technology into teaching and learning. Developed by Dr. Ruben Puentedura, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>model supports and enables teachers to design, develop, and infuse digital learning experiences that utilize technology. The goal is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to transform learning experiences so they result in higher levels of achievement for students.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Substitution Augmentation Modification Redefinition model offers a method of seeing how computer technology might impact teaching and learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It also shows a progression that adopters of educational technology often follow as they progress through teaching and learning with technology. </span></p>

                        <p class="p1">In Pickerington Local School District, we believe that the future of technology integration is through a  blended learning model that would create an environment where students and teachers learn and teach more effectively. Blended learning can provide students with choice and voice in their learning which has the ability to be customized for each student, reaching students of varying learning styles.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The goal of blended learning is to combine the best teaching practice from a traditional classroom and those from a digital classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The teaching strategies should align to the goals of the learning objective.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some lessons may require the use of technology, other lessons technology may not be needed, while other lessons may need technology for part of the lesson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The end goal is to have and utilize the proper tool to enhance the curriculum and meet the instructional needs of the students.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Here are the eight characteristics of Pickerington’s Blended Learning environment.</span></p>

This environment promotes communication, collaboration, innovation, inspiration, creative exploration which encourages learning through productivity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">Blended learning model of learning require educators to rethink how they organize physical spaces to facilitate best collaborative learning using digital tools. Considerations include the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li2"><span class="s5">Are the design and layout of the physical space dynamic and flexible enough to facilitate the technology-enabled learning models and practices selected? Can a space in which an educator delivers whole-class instruction also be shifted to facilitate individual online practice and research? </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s5">Do the physical spaces align in their ability to facilitate individual and collaborative work? When practices such as project-based learning require students to be working together with multiple devices for research and presentation building, is the space as useful as when individual learners need time and space to connect with information and experts online for personalized learning? </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s5">Can the physical spaces and tools be shaped to provide multiple contexts and learning experiences such as Wi-Fi access for outdoor classrooms? Are library spaces able to become laboratories? Can a space used as a history lecture hall for one class become a maker space for engineering the next period? </span></li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Criteria for Near End of Life Devices</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The District understands the rapid rate of change and advancement in the areas of hardware. In response to this change, the District must manage its technology assets in a manner consistent with both fiscal prudence and the need to provide technologically appropriate systems to students and staff.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The goals of the technology replacement plan are to:</b></span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Assure that appropriate technology is available to support the mission and vision of the District</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Assure that each faculty member has a device of sufficient capability to fulfill his/her responsibilities</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Provide for the cost effective and timely purchasing and installation of new equipment</span></li>

</ol>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Computer Life Cycle</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The useful service life of a typical device is approximately four to seven years. The District’s inventory of computers may turn over every five to six years. In the Summer of 2013, the District entered into a three-year lease agreement with Apple for the lease of iPads, laptops and desktops. In the One2One program the student devices will be refreshed on a four-year cycle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students will have one devices for grades 5-8 and then traded in for a new device for grades 9-12.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Near End of Life Technology Equipment</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The District will maintain all technology equipment until it is ineffective. This process will continue until the equipment is no longer capable of functioning or the cost to upgrade or repair becomes too great. The technology equipment considered to be at the end of life cycle will be submitted to the Technology Department for removal from the inventory. Devices that are determined to be at the end of life cycle will either be recycled or sold back to a company.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Google Apps for Education</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The District is offering students and staff a free educational suite of applications for use to enhance teaching and learning. Google Apps is a concept known as “in the cloud” where services and storage are provided over the Internet. The District is providing users Google Message Security. This service provides System Administrators the capability to limit messages based on where they are from, where they are going, or the content they contain. The District will use this technology protection measure to block or filter, to the extent practicable, access of visual depictions that are obscene, pornographic, and harmful to minors over the network.This is in compliance with CIPA, Children’s Internet Protection Act.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The District focuses on helping all students learn and grow. The One2One digital learning program empowers teachers and students to engage in teaching and learning through the district’s curriculum in more impactful ways then with limited technology. The One2One digital learning program allows our students and teachers access to a variety of resources at all achievement levels, the ability to participate in differentiated learning activities based upon the skills and concepts that they need to learn, and develop unique learning products that demonstrate their understanding of the curriculum standards and learning objectives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The One2One digital learning program allows for access, authenticity, equity, and choice; while also increasing the collaboration, communication, creativity and critical thinking of our students. The advantage of the One2One digital learning program exists because each student will have his/her own device and can learn anytime and anywhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The focus is not solely on technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The main focus is about a paradigm shift in how instruction is delivered and how that instruction sparks creativity and innovation in students providing a new sense of engagement and ownership in their own learning.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition, One2One learning environments differ from traditional environments in most school settings because they offer all students and teachers continuous access to a wide range of software, electronic documents, the Internet and other digital tools for teaching and learning. The key component is the access of information, engaging students and encouraging them to take responsibility for their own learning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Implementation of the 1:1 Digital Learning Program</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The One2One Digital Learning device is a learning tool that will be integrated with the District’s curriculum. In order to receive the device, the student and parents/guardian must sign off on the One2One Digital Learning Program Student Use Agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All students must abide by the District’s Acceptable Use Policy and Social Media Guidelines. Students are expected to bring the device to school each day and keep the device charged and in good working order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See the Student Use Agreement for more details.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Starting in the 2016 &#8211; 2017 school year, all current fifth and sixth grade students (Class of 2023 and 2024) will be supplied with a device. Each subsequent 5th grade class will receive a device at the beginning of the 5th grade year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then when entering the 9th grade students will be requested to trade in their current device for an updated model. Any student withdrawing or graduating from the District is required to turn in their device or additional fees will be placed on the student’s account.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Digital Learning at the High School Level</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The District’s venture into expanded digital learning includes increase the integration of technology in the classroom through the One2One Digital Learning Program, additionally the creating of digital learning courses at the high school level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Digital learning at this level is a part of the digital learning program in which the District will create additional opportunities for students to be involved in coursework digitally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This plan will increase the use of a learning management platform during the regular school day, promote the use of digital learning strategies such as flipped learning, and create digital academic opportunities for students through asynchronous online and hybrid course offerings.</span></p>

                        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why iPad Minis/Airs for Grades Pre-K &#8211; 4?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The device that used needs to be selected due to the academic needs and instructional purpose in the classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Elementary One2One model will be where each classroom teacher has a cart of iPad Minis available in their classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The iPads will stay in the classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There will be a limited number of iPads available for check out through the school’s media center for students that need to take a device home. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Elementary staff members have given the recommendation that we continue with the iPad for numerous reason: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">The iPad works well with current digital tools that are already in place with the elementary curriculum.</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">The apps that are available for the iPad are more elementary student friendly then the apps available in the Google Play store.</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Elementary students perform better with the touchscreen functionality.</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">iPad Minis are lighter and easier for younger students to handle.</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Improved battery life will last the entire school day.</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Students are comfortable with the device and the iPad Mini is extremely easy to use.</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">iPad Minis have all of the creative tools (video, audio) that are needed to integrate with the elementary curriculum.</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">More simulations, videos and interactive media for elementary students then the Chromebooks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why Chromebooks for Grades 5-12?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The District in 2015 transitioned all email systems, file storage, calendar services, video conferencing services, classroom learning management systems to Google Apps for Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With this transition more of more of the District’s educators are using Google Apps for Education products in their classrooms, ranging from Google Classroom to collaborative Google Docs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The past practice of using shared iPads is difficult to properly use Google Apps for Education as the iPads are clunky in using multiple apps for Google.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Education Benefit </b>&#8211; In choosing the Chromebook the District has the ability to put a device in the hand of every student in the District.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Technology can have positive impacts on the educational process, but only if the technology is available when needed by the teacher or the student. The current model of sharing iPad carts limits the time students can use technology. Additionally the Chromebook 1:1 model will allow students to have devices 24/7.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hope is this model will allow learning to become a never-ending process, in which students can learn anywhere, anytime.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Chromebooks can work with or without an Internet connect </b>&#8211; Current surveys show that 92% of the District’s students have access to the Internet at home, but 8% do not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through the PickConnect program we are working to increase opportunities for students to access the Internet, through partnership with local business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Chromebooks do have a small hard drive built into the system and can even be used at home without a Internet connection and be properly synced in seconds once the student enters the school.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Apps can be pushed out in seconds</b> &#8211; The current practice of utilizing iPads causes some issues for loading apps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This process involves one person in the building (the Building Technology Advisor) syncing the carts to update/install apps and operating systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This process through an iPad can be time consuming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By utilizing the Google Apps Management Console, the technology department can push out apps wirelessly to specific groups of students or to all of the students in the District within minutes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also teachers have the ability to create contact groups and push out apps just for their students.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>There are little to no security/virus issues </b>&#8211; As with all of the Chromebooks most things are stored in the cloud.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That means there is nothing to “steal” from the computer and nothing for a virus to attach itself. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>They turn on in eight seconds or less </b>&#8211; The quick start up process saves precious instructional time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Chromebooks have a battery life of eight to ten hours</b> &#8211; Current<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chromebooks will last the entire school day, making re-charging during the day not needed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Why the Dell Chromebook 11?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Technology Committee has selected the Dell Chromebook 11 as the Chromebook Model to begin the 1:1 digital learning program with grades 5-8. The Dell Chromebook 11 merges the benefits of a chromebook and touchscreen device, giving teachers and students more resources to use to improve teaching and learning. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Product Overview:</span><span class="s1"> The Dell Chromebook 11 runs the Chrome operating<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>system, has 4 GB of RAM, a 32 GB solid state hard drive, an 11.6 inch touchscreen, 802.11 ac WIFI connection and bluetooth capabilities. Superior durability and design:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1"><b>School tough</b>: The Dell Chromebook 11 is MIL-STD (U.S. Military Standard) tested for durability, pressure, temperature, humidity, shock and vibration so it can handle student life. </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1"><b>Built for the backpack: </b>The rubberized LCD and base trim absorbs shock for superior drop protection. </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1"><b>Surface strength:</b> The scratch-resistant touch screen is made of Corning® Gorilla® Glass NBT™ — built to handle every tap, stroke and swipe. </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1"><b>Spill protection:</b> Students can learn without fear. A fully sealed keyboard and touch pad provide the industry’s best spill protection for a student laptop. </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1"><b>Lightweight design: </b>At under three pounds with a compact 11.6&#8243; display, it’s easy to pop it in a backpack and head from class to class.</span></li>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The goal of blended learning is to combine the best teaching practice from a traditional classroom and those from a digital classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The teaching strategies should align to the goals of the learning objective.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some lessons may require the use of technology, other lessons technology may not be needed, while other lessons may need technology for part of the lesson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The end all goal is to have and utilize the proper tool to enhance the curriculum and meet the instructional needs of the students.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Live and Work in a Blended Learning Environment:</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">With the addition of the One2One devices teachers and students now have access to technology and digital tools anytime they are needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers need to transition lessons that can be enhanced or better achieved into a digital media.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We understand that not all teachers will be at the same skill and knowledge level, but every attempt needs to be made to have a digital presence in each teacher’s classroom. It is recommended that teachers explore digital resources that are supported by the District (ST Math, Gale Virtual Library, STAR, Illuminate Ed).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also staff members are encouraged to join a digital Professional Learning Network through a social media platform (Twitter, Google+, Facebook) to learn and share from people outside of the district.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Have a Presence in Google Classroom:</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The District has adopted the suite of digital tools with Google Apps for Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hence the District is adopting Google Classroom as our Learning Management System (LMS).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each teacher needs to have an online presence in Google Classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By having everyone utilize the same LMS students, teachers and parents will be more comfortable with the LMS, building consistency across the District.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Use the Device as an Teaching and Learning Tool with the Key Applications supported by the District:</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Over the past few years the District has adopted numerous digital tools to enhance and support the curriculum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the addition of the One2One program teachers and students now have access to devices anytime, anywhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teachers need to utilize the digital tools that have been adopted and are supported by the District. Some of those digital tools support by the District are: Eureka/Wheatley Online, Gale Virtual Research Library, Google Apps, History Alive, Illuminate Education, Imagine Learning, Moby Max, Naviance, Reading Eggs, Renaissance Learning, Springboard Online, ST Math.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Use Less Paper, Not Completely Paperless</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">With the increase use of digital collaboration and communication tools the need to print every document should decrease.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The use of Google Apps for Education (especially Google Drive and Google Classroom) teachers and students can communicate and receive feedback through digital tools instead of traditional printing methods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through communicating via digital tools teachers and students can create more of a collaborative environment in which teachers can give feedback and then students can clarify and continue to communicate in ways that traditional methods will not allow. It is understood that there will be times that printing is needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is requested that only those necessary items get printed. The district will not support printing from the student One2One devices.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Have an Open Mind, Be a Contributor:</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Venturing into the world of blended learning is pulling those best practices that teachers have learned in a traditional classroom, plus the addition of new practices learned by effective use of digital tools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through these new tools and new way of thinking of teaching and learning, everyone is encouraged to be willing to try new strategies and integrate the digital tools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Staff has the ability to implement blended learning without the fear of failure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some things are going to go well and some things will go wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is up to everyone to learn from those things that go wrong and share those things that go well. Educators need to work together to share best practices and contribute to improved teaching and learning of everyone in the District.</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additional monthly professional development will be scheduled for building leaders to build their capacity to share with staff in their building.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The District has partnered with the Tierney Professional Development Team to provide ongoing face to face and online support and training.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The District will also partner with the Instructional Technology Services of Central Ohio (ITSCO) to deliver some online and face-to-face trainings on major technology initiatives in the District.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The District will send a group of teachers or school leaders on an annual basis to the Ohio Educational Technology Conference (OETC). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In-district technology courses for college credit will be taught on an on-going basis concentrating on the major initiatives from the Technology Department. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On-going, relative, and personalized professional development for the District’s staff will be crucial for continued effective use of technology by educators.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Instructional Technology Professional Learning Series</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The PLSD Instructional Technology Professional Learning Series is a targeted professional development series designed to advance the skills, abilities, and knowledge of teachers, administrators and support staff of the Pickerington Local School District. The Professional Learning Series (PLS) ensures that educators become even more effective in their skills in advancing the practice of integrating technology, ultimately helping to improve student learning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The PLSD Instructional Technology Professional Learning Series is grounded in the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) standards for students, teachers, instructional coaches and administrators, as well as examining the essential conditions for successful technology integration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Professional Learning Series provides a sequenced curriculum that develops foundational instructional technology integration skills as well as increasing those skills to be able to make technology used in more impactful ways. The Professional Learning Series will focus on current instructional technology tools used in the PLSD classrooms and concentrate on increasing the effectiveness of those technology tools through the SAMR Model.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Professional Learning Series is made up of eight, one-hour sessions over the course of the academic year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to our face-to-face PLS offering, there will be the availability for online extension sessions through Google Hangouts, as well all sessions will be recorded and placed online to extend the anytime, anywhere learning of our educators.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Google Certified Training for all District Educators</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the District continues to utilize more and more tools from Google Apps for Education it is important that we supply the District’s educators with quality professional development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through this plan the District will make Google Level 1 Certification training available to all educators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This online training created by Google will allow all educators to get a solid understanding of the digital tools in Google Apps for Education.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Additionally the District will make 400 Google Level 2 Certificate Trainings on a first come, first serve basis to educators that finish the Google Level 1 Certification program.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Bringing Equity to Learning Through Technology </b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Closing the Digital Use Divide </b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Traditionally, the digital divide in education referred to schools and communities in which access to devices and Internet connectivity were either unavailable or unaccessible. However, we have to be cognizant of a new digital divide—the disparity between students who use technology to create, design, build, explore, and collaborate and those who simply use technology to consume media passively. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On its own, access to the Internet and devices does not guarantee access to engaging educational experiences or a quality education. Without thoughtful intervention and attention to the way technology is used for learning, the digital use divide could grow even as access to technology in schools increases. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Through ongoing and personalized professional development PLSD staff members will learn strategies and skills to take technology integration from passive use to more active use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The SAMR model will be the framework in which staff members will be able to measure passive or active use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Partnership with Tierney Professional Development Team</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the increase number of devices and digital opportunities available to students and staff there will be an even larger need for support and professional development then what the current Instructional Technology Department can provide. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Tierney Professional Development Team will work with the District to create a responsible plan and timeframe that supports instructional technology implementation best practices for teacher success that drives effective student learning outcomes and achievement. Outside of teachers and students, other stakeholder involvement will be decided as they are an integral part of instructional technology implementation.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Utilization of Evaluation Metrics</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Through the use of the first three evaluation metric tools, the District will on an annual basis, update each of the evaluation tools, with the following goals:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>ISTE Lead &amp; Transform Diagnostic Tool </b>&#8211; Increase in all 14 areas into the “meeting” category.</span></li>

</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The PLSD Technology Summative Evaluation will allow the committee to determine the larger communities beliefs and feedback.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The additional rubrics will allow the committee and technology department to evaluate the individual use of digital tools.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>ISTE Lead &amp; Transform Diagnostic Tool</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The technology committee will use the ISTE Lead &amp; Transform Diagnostic Tool to evaluate the effective use of technology in the District.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The ISTE Lead &amp; Transform Diagnostic Tool is a resource that takes a snapshot of your school or district’s alignment to the 14 Essential Conditions for learning and teaching with technology. The tool generates a report with data that can guide the District’s tech planning and implementation decisions as the committee moves forward.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After completing the questionnaire, the committee will receive immediate access to results that will help the committee pinpoint the District&#8217;s strengths and areas of growth. The data in the report will allow the committee to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p7"><span class="s1">Measure the District’s progress toward becoming tech- and standards-ready.</span></li>
<li class="p7"><span class="s1">Inform the District’s comprehensive planning and decision making.</span></li>
<li class="p7"><span class="s1">Identify the resources the District will need to help meet the tech integration goals.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">See more about ISTE’s 14 Essential Conditions at: http://www.iste.org/standards/essential-conditions</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Future Ready Digital Learning Readiness Tool</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Technology now allows for personalized digital learning for every student in the nation. The Future Ready District Pledge, according to the U.S. Department of Education, is designed to set out a roadmap to achieve that success and to commit districts to move as quickly as possible towards a shared vision of preparing students for success in college, careers and citizenship. This roadmap can only be accomplished through a systemic approach to change, as outlined in the graphic below.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With student learning at the center, a district must align each of the seven (7) key categories, or gears, in order to advance toward successful digital learning:</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">Use of Time</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">Technology, Networks, and Hardware</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">Data and Privacy </span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">Community Partnerships</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">Professional Learning</span></li>
<li class="p4"><span class="s1">Budget and Resources</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The outside rings in the figure emphasize the importance of empowered leadership and the cycle of transformation where districts vision, plan, implement and assess continually. Once the district is strategically staged in each gear, district leaders can be confident that they are ready for a highly successful implementation phase that leads to innovation through digital learning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Apple’s Educator Technology Profile</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">About the Technology Profile Report<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&#8211; The report contains summary data from the Apple Educator Technology Profile, plus analysis and recommendations for next steps to support teachers in their technology infusion practices. In addition, the report provides data about the technology available to teachers either personally or at school, their preferences for professional development delivery, and their views on technology support at both school and district levels. Survey responses are unique to each institution, and the response rate is solely the responsibility of the institution.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Education Technology Profile is a 15-minute online self-assessment that gathers information about educators’ technology skills and infusion practices within an institution, school, or district. The resulting data is aligned to Dr. Ruben Puentedura’s SAMR model and provides education leaders information that spotlights faculty strengths and professional development opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is important to realize that all four stages of SAMR practice can make valuable contributions to the work of an institution; however, large improvements in student outcomes are not observed until the upper stages are reached. Hence, it is desirable for faculty to progressively develop their practice to reach these upper stages. When the Education Technology Profile is used as an evaluation metric tool, it engages the entire leadership team in identifying the levels of professional development best suited to faculty and creating actionable steps that move their goals from vision to reality. Along with the Education Leadership Profile, it provides a data-driven view of the institution’s technology implementation impact on learning and teaching.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Student Perception Survey based on ISTE Standards</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In a partnership with Dr. Laci Fiala, Associate Professor of Sociology for Walsh University, the District will survey all students involved in the One to One program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Questions on the survey are based on the ISTE Student Standards, which have been deconstructed and rewritten into student-friendly language. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This survey, and the ISTE standards, will measure the students perception on how technology is improving their learning through six different areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Creativity and Innovation</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Communication and Collaboration</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Research and Information Fluency</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Critical Thinking, Problem Solving and Decision Making</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Digital Citizenship</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Technology Operations and Concepts</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As the District continues to roll out the One to One program, this survey will turn into a longitudinal study of the effect of technology on teaching and learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All identifiable student information will be kept in the District, only an identification number, for each student, will be shared with Dr. Fiala and only for data analysis purposes.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Q. What is a Chromebook? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A. &#8220;Chromebooks are mobile devices designed specifically for people who live on the web. With a comfortable, full-sized keyboard, large display and clickable trackpad, all-day battery life, lightweight and built-in ability to connect to Wi-Fi and mobile broadband networks, the Chromebook is ideal for anytime, anywhere access to the web.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Q. What kind of software does a Chromebook run? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A. &#8220;Chromebooks run thousands of web-based applications, or web apps, that open right in the browser. You can access web apps by typing their URL into the address bar or by installing them instantly from the Chrome Web Store.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recently announced, Chromebooks will be able to run Android apps starting in the summer/fall of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Q. How are these web-based applications managed? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A. Each Chromebook we provide to students will be a managed device. Members of Pickerington Local School District Technology Department will maintain devices through our Google Apps for Education account.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Q. Can the Chromebook be used anywhere at anytime?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A. Yes, as long as you have a wi-fi signal to access the web. There is an offline option, as well, when using Google Drive, and when students enter a wi-fi connection, it syncs again to the student’s google account.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Q. Will our Chromebook have 3G/Cellular Signal? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A. No. The district Chromebooks will not have 3G broadband or a cellular signal. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Q. Is there antivirus software included with the Chromebooks? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A. No, there is not. As all of the data is stored in the cloud, there is no need for antivirus software. They do, however, come with web filtering. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Q. How long will the Chromebook run on a fully charged battery? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A. Chromebooks have a rated battery life of 8-10 hours. However, we do expect that students charge them each evening to ensure maximum performance during the school day without interruption of use. </span></p>

                <div class="togglecontent">
                                        <div class="full">
                        <p>Does your child have a phone or other new piece of technology? Are your children always on their iPhones or tablet? Do your children have a Twitter, Facebook, SnapChat, or KIK account? If you answer yes for any of these questions – or if your answer was, “What’s SnapChat and KIK?” – these hints, tips and tricks for parenting in the digital world will be helpful.</p>
<p>After a recent study on the impact of social media on kids and families, The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reported that there could be benefits to children using sites like Facebook. Those benefits include increased communication, access to information, and help in developing a sense of self. But, there can be serious downsides to all this online sharing, too.</p>
<p>Social networking is on the rise. The study found that 22 percent of teenagers log onto their favorite social media sites more than 10 times a day, and 75 percent own cell phones. This level of engagement online increases the risks of cyberbullying, “Facebook depression” (a new phenomenon where “de-friending” and online bullying lead to symptoms of depression), exposure to inappropriate content, and sexting.</p>
<p>Just as we prepare our kids for life in the real world, we should prepare them for life in the online world.</p>

                        <p><strong>No Underage Facebooking</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that no one under the age of 13 is permitted to join Facebook? Of course, there is no real way for Facebook to truly enforce this limit, because everyone can lie about age. That’s why it’s up to parents to ensure their children stay away from Facebook until 13 – and until you as a parent are comfortable with them having an account.</p>
<p><strong>Check the Device’s Privacy Settings </strong></p>
<p>Check that the privacy settings for the Internet and <a href="https://www.fosi.org/good-digital-parenting/how-set-facebook-privacy-settings/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> on your children&#8217;s digital devices are set to the strictest levels. Depending on which browser you are using, you can adjust settings directly from the “options” tab. Adjust levels on things such as cookies, third party sites, and more. This protects the computer user as well as the computer from the threat of viruses.</p>
<p>Checking Facebook privacy settings is easy, too. Ensure that you are up to speed on Facebook&#8217;s privacy policy and make any changes you deem necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Create Ground Rules</strong></p>
<p>If your kids are old enough to use the computer on their own, they are old enough to understand that there are rules they need to follow. Breaking those rules should not have a lesser consequence than if they broke a rule in the offline world. One way for families to agree on ground rules is to create a contract that all parties must sign. The Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI) (<a href="http://www.fosi.org">www.fosi.org</a>) encourages parents and kids to have an open discussion about what these rules mean, and offers <a href="https://www.fosi.org/good-digital-parenting/family-online-safety-contract/" target="_blank">a good example of a contract here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Learn Your Child’s Habits</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need to be a super sleuth and spy on your kid’s every online move, but it is important to be aware of the people they are associating with and the kinds of sites they are frequenting. After all, you get to know the friends they are hanging out with at school; knowing their online friends shouldn’t be any different. Parents should require full access to their children’s Facebook friends and the ability to take a look whenever they wish.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Computers in a Central Location</strong></p>
<p>It’s much easier to keep tabs on online activity when computers are located in a high-traffic zone rather than in the privacy of a child’s own room. Place computers in a central location like your kitchen or family room so everything is out in the open.</p>
<p><strong>Teach Children to Avoid Online Questionnaires, Free Giveaways and Contests</strong></p>
<p>A pop-up ad appears and tells kids they can win a free iPad by simply clicking the link. Anyone would be tempted by this kind of offer, but kids are particularly susceptible. It’s important to warn kids against falling for this kind of Internet trick. Many of these ruses are attempts to glean personal information or to download malware to digital devices. Teach children that even if a friend forwards a fun online questionnaire, it’s best to close the window and not participate.</p>
<p><strong>Monitor Pictures Your Children Post Online</strong></p>
<p>In an ideal world, your children would never post photos of themselves online, but that might not be entirely realistic. If children want to share photos with their friends via email or a social networking site, be sure you know exactly which pictures are being posted. Make sure the content of the photo is completely innocuous and that no identifiable locales are noticeable in the background.</p>
<p><strong>Set a Good Example</strong></p>
<p>If parents are tweeting and updating their Facebook pages at a stoplight or taking every opportunity to “just check something,” they are setting a poor precedent for social media use that children will surely follow. Always ask yourself if you’re setting a good example and demonstrating proper technology etiquette as well.</p>
<p><strong>Limit Cell Phone Use</strong></p>
<p>Parents should limit cell phone use, just as they would limit use of a computer, TV or gaming system. Only allow cell phone use at certain hours in the evening or after homework has been completed.</p>
<p>If you have teens of driving age, teach them that under no circumstances should cell phones ever be used while driving. (For underage teens in Ohio, this is a primary offense, meaning police can pull drivers over for texting while driving.) Phones should be kept off or in the glove compartment so incoming text sounds aren’t a distraction.</p>
<p><strong>Teach Kids about their Online Reputation</strong></p>
<p>What is posted online stays online forever. Many kids don’t understand the permanence of the images and messages they post online. They also don’t understand that there are no secrets in social media. Parents should talk to their children about the impact posting inappropriate messages and images could have if a future college administrator or employer were to find them.</p>
<p><strong>Talk to Kids about Online Dangers</strong></p>
<p>You may feel like you’re scaring your kids when talking to them about the dangers of being online, but it’s better for them to be scared than to be unaware. Having an open line of communication is crucial the minute your kids start using the Internet more independently.</p>

                        <p>Kids master technology quickly and easily pick up the nuances any new gadget has, often far more easily than adults. It is every parent’s responsibility to know exactly which key features are included in the gadgets their kids are using.</p>
<p>To help parents understand the technology, below is a list of the most common social media apps students are using today, along with a description about what parents should know and understand about each one.</p>

                        <p><strong>Facebook </strong></p>
<p>This is the world&#8217;s largest social network, with more than 1 billion users worldwide.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook is not private. Anything posted online, whether it’s an image or a comment, stays in cyberspace forever. A Facebook post is only as good as a friendship. A friend today may be gone tomorrow. What happens with that post or image then? That “no-longer” friend may disseminate it to others. Images might even be digitally altered and sent to others.</li>
<li>Many parents think “friending” their kids is enough to keep them safe and ensure they are behaving appropriately on Facebook. However, many kids are creating two Facebook profiles, one for their friends and one for their parents.</li>
<li>According to the FBI, there are 500,000 predators trying to engage kids online. Facebook is one of the venues where predators try to “friend” children and establish a relationship.</li>
<li>Whenever a child posts anything on Facebook, whether it’s an image or a comment, it can affect their futures. Why? Because every time a child posts something online, they are creating their own personal brand online and permanent digital footprint that stays in cyberspace forever. Children should be taught to think, “Is this post or image really representing who I am? Would I be embarrassed if a teacher or my grandma saw it?”</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>KIK Messenger</strong></p>
<p>This app lets kids text for free. It&#8217;s fast and has no message limits, character limits, or fees if you only use the basic features. Because it&#8217;s an app, the texts won&#8217;t show up on a phone&#8217;s messaging service, and you&#8217;re not charged for them (beyond standard data rates).</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s loaded with ads and in-app-purchases.</li>
<li>KIK specializes in &#8220;promoted chats,&#8221; which are basically conversations between brands and users. It also offers specially designed apps (accessible only through the main app), many of which offer products for sale.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s some stranger danger. An app named OinkText, linked to KIK, allows communication with strangers who share their KIK usernames to find people to chat with. There&#8217;s also a KIK community blog where users can submit photos of themselves and screenshots of messages (sometimes displaying users&#8217; full names) to contests.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ooVoo</strong></p>
<p>This is a free video, voice, and messaging app. Users can have group chats with up to 12 people for free. It&#8217;s common for kids to log on after school and keep it open while doing homework.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You can only chat with approved friends. Users can only communicate with those on their approved contact lists, which can help ease parents&#8217; safety concerns.</li>
<li>It can be distracting. Because the service makes video chatting so affordable and accessible, it also can be addicting. A conversation with your kids about multitasking may be in order.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp</strong></p>
<p>This app lets users send text messages, audio messages, videos, and photos to one or many people with no message limits or fees.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s supposed to be for users 16 and over, but lots of younger teens seem to be using the app. This age minimum has been set by WhatsApp.</li>
<li>It can be pushy. After you sign up, it automatically connects you to all the people in your address book who also are using WhatsApp. It also encourages you to add friends who haven&#8217;t signed up yet.</li>

                        <p><strong>Instagram</strong></p>
<p>This lets users snap, edit, and share photos and 15-second videos, either publicly or with a private network of followers. It unites the most popular features of social media sites: sharing, seeing, and commenting on photos. It also lets you apply fun filters and effects to your photos, making them look high quality and artistic.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Teens are on the lookout for digital &#8220;likes.&#8221; Similar to the way they use Facebook, teens may measure the &#8220;success&#8221; of their photos &#8212; even their self-worth &#8212; by the number of likes or comments they receive. Posting a photo or video can be problematic if teens post it to validate their popularity.</li>
<li>Public photos are the default. Photos and videos shared on Instagram are public unless privacy settings are adjusted. Hashtags and location information can make photos even more visible to communities beyond a teen&#8217;s followers if his or her account is public.</li>
<li>Private messaging is now an option. Instagram Direct allows users to send &#8220;private messages&#8221; to up to 15 mutual friends. These pictures don&#8217;t show up on their public feeds. Although there&#8217;s nothing inherently wrong with group chats, kids may be more likely to share inappropriate things with their inner circles.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Periscope </strong></p>
<p>This app lets you share and experience live video streams direct from a smartphone or tablet. It can be used to capture the atmosphere among fans at an important match, to broadcast an unfolding news story, or to experience what it’s like to walk down the streets of Pickerington or New York City.</p>
<p><em>What parents should know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The premise of the app is that it allows you to live stream video, direct from your phone or tablet.</li>
<li>Aside from just watching video streams, Periscope allows for real time interaction. Viewers can “heart” the streams they like and can interact with the person streaming the video through the comments/chat function.</li>
<li>You can explore the videos being broadcast in different parts of the world through the interactive map feature. This allows you to search for videos by location and find streams of particular events taking place.</li>
<li>All Periscope accounts and broadcasts are public for anyone to see, unless you adjust the settings. The integration with Twitter makes it easier to reach a worldwide audience very quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Tumblr </strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">This is like a cross between a blog and Twitter. It&#8217;s a streaming scrapbook of text, photos, and/or videos and audio clips. Users create and follow short blogs, or &#8220;tumblelogs,&#8221; that can be seen by anyone online (if made public). Many teens have tumblelogs for personal use: sharing photos, videos, musings, and things they find funny with their friends.</span></p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy can be guarded but only through an awkward workaround. The first profile a member creates is public and viewable by anyone on the Internet. Members who desire full privacy have to create a second profile, which they&#8217;re able to password-protect.</li>
<li>Pornography is easy to find. This online hangout is hip and creative but sometimes raunchy. Pornographic images and videos and depictions of violence, self-harm, drug use, and offensive language are easily searchable.</li>
<li>Posts are often copied and shared. Reblogging on Tumblr is similar to re-tweeting: A post is reblogged from one tumblelog to another. Many teens like &#8212; and, in fact, want &#8212; their posts reblogged. But do you really want your kids&#8217; words and photos on someone else&#8217;s page?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>
<p>This is a microblogging site that allows users to post brief, 140-character messages &#8212; called &#8220;tweets&#8221; &#8212; and follow other users&#8217; activities. It&#8217;s not only for adults. Teens like using it to share tidbits and keep up with news and celebrities.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Public tweets are the norm for teens. Though you can choose to keep your tweets private, most teens report having public accounts. Talk to your kids about what they post and how a post can spread far and fast.</li>
<li>Updates appear immediately. Even though you can remove tweets, your followers can still read what you wrote until it&#8217;s gone. This can get kids in trouble if they say something in the heat of the moment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vine</strong></p>
<p>This social media app lets users post and watch looping six-second video clips. This Twitter-owned service has developed a unique community of people who post videos that are often creative, funny, and sometimes thought-provoking. Teens usually use Vine to create and share silly videos of themselves and/or their friends and families.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s full of inappropriate videos.</li>
<li>There are significant privacy concerns. The videos you post, the accounts you follow, and the comments you make on videos all are public by default. But you can adjust your settings to protect your posts so that only followers will see them, and you have to approve new followers.</li>
<li>Parents can be star performers (without their knowledge). If your teens film you being goofy or silly, you may want to talk about whether they plan to share it.</li>

                        <p><strong>Burn Note</strong></p>
<p>This app erases its messages after a set period of time. Unlike many other apps of this sort, it limits itself to text messages. Users cannot send pictures or video. That may reduce issues such as sexting, but words can hurt, too.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It allows kids to communicate covertly. To discourage copying and taking screenshots, a spotlight-like system that recipients direct with a finger (or the mouse) only reveals a portion of the message at a time.</li>
<li>It may encourage risky sharing. The company claims that its &#8220;Multi-Device Deletion&#8221; system can delete a message from anywhere: the device it was sent from, the device it was sent to, and its own servers. But it&#8217;s wise to be skeptical of this claim, and it&#8217;s always possible for anything sent online to be copied as an image via screenshots.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t have to have the app to receive a Burn Note. Unlike other apps &#8212; for example, Snapchat &#8212; users can send a Burn Note to anyone, including others who don&#8217;t have the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Snapchat </strong></p>
<p>This messaging app lets users put a time limit on the pictures and videos they send before they disappear. Most teens use the app to share goofy or embarrassing photos without the risk of them going public. However, there are lots of opportunities to use it in other ways.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s a myth that Snapchats go away forever. Data is data: Whenever an image is sent, it never truly goes away. For example, the person on the receiving end can take a screenshot of the image before it disappears. Snapchats can even be recovered.</li>
<li>It can make sexting seem OK. The seemingly risk-free messaging might encourage users to share pictures containing sexy images.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TapTalk</strong></p>
<p>After connecting via Facebook, this app lets you tap the image of a friend to take a picture. By holding their picture down, you record a short video of a few seconds. Using the front-facing camera, users can send a selfie or, as is often the case, a short video message to that friend. Click on the bottom half of the camera field and you can type in a short message.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The app displays both the photo and a map of where you are when you upload the picture.</li>
<li>Talking a cue from SnapChat, any photo of video you send can’t be retrieved after you’ve seen it. You also can’t pre-take a photo and upload it. Everything you send to others is unique.</li>
<li>Because the app displays both the photo/and a map of where you are — in the case of sending a video — this means the app is turning into a sort of video walkie-talkie.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Whisper</strong></p>
<p>This a social &#8220;confessional&#8221; app that allows users to post whatever&#8217;s on their minds, paired with an image. With all the emotions running through teens, anonymous outlets give them the freedom to share their feelings with the perception that they are free of judgment.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Whispers are often sexual in nature. Some users use the app to try to hook up with people nearby, while others post &#8220;confessions&#8221; of desire. Lots of eye-catching nearly nude pics accompany these shared secrets.</li>
<li>Content can be dark. People normally don&#8217;t confess sunshine and rainbows. Common Whisper topics include insecurity, depression, substance abuse, and various lies told to employers and teachers.</li>
<li>Although it&#8217;s anonymous to start, it may not stay that way. The app encourages users to exchange personal information in the &#8220;Meet Up&#8221; section.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>YikYak</strong></p>
<p>This free social-networking app lets users post brief, Twitter-like comments to the 500 geographically nearest Yik Yak users. Kids can find out opinions, secrets, rumors, and more. Plus, they&#8217;ll get the bonus thrill of knowing all these have come from a 1.5-mile radius (maybe even from the kids at the desks in front of them!).</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It reveals your location. By default, your exact location is shown unless you toggle location-sharing off. Each time you open the app, GPS updates your location.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a mixed bag of trouble. This app has it all: cyberbullying, explicit sexual content, unintended location-sharing, and exposure to explicit information about drugs and alcohol.</li>
<li>Some schools have banned access. Pickerington Schools has blocked this app on our Internet, but all students have to do is use their own phone&#8217;s cellular signal and they are online. Some teens have used the app to threaten others, causing school lockdowns in other parts of the country. The app&#8217;s gossipy and sometimes cruel nature can be toxic to a school environment.</li>

                        <p><strong>Hinge/Tinder/Grindr/OkCupid</strong></p>
<p>This is a photo and messaging dating app for browsing pictures of potential matches within a certain-mile radius of the user&#8217;s location. It&#8217;s very popular with 20-somethings as a way to meet new people for casual or long-term relationships.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting up (and possibly hooking up) is pretty much the goal.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s all about swipes. You swipe right to &#8220;like&#8221; a photo or left to &#8220;pass.&#8221; If a person whose photo you &#8220;liked&#8221; swipes &#8220;like&#8221; on your photo, too, the app allows you to message each other.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s location-based. Geolocation means it&#8217;s possible for teens to meet up with nearby people, which can be very dangerous.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Meet Me</strong></p>
<p>“Chat and Meet New People,&#8221; says it all. Although not marketed as a dating app, MeetMe does have a &#8220;Match&#8221; feature whereby users can &#8220;secretly admire&#8221; others, and its large user base means fast-paced communication and guaranteed attention.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s an open network. Users can chat with whomever&#8217;s online, as well as search locally, opening the door for potential trouble.</li>
<li>Lots of details are required. First and last name, age, and ZIP code are requested at registration, or you can log in using a Facebook account. The app also asks permission to use location services on your teens&#8217; mobile devices, meaning they can find the closest matches wherever they go.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Omegle</strong></p>
<p>This is a chat site (and app) that puts two strangers together in their choice of a text chat or video chat room. Being anonymous can be very attractive to teens, and Omegle provides a no-fuss opportunity to make connections. Its &#8220;interest boxes&#8221; also let users filter potential chat partners by shared interests.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Users get paired up with strangers. That&#8217;s the whole premise of the app. And there&#8217;s no registration required.</li>
<li>This is not an app for kids and teens. Omegle is filled with people searching for sexual chat. Some prefer to do so live. Others offer links to porn sites.</li>
<li>Language is a big issue. Since the chats are anonymous, they&#8217;re often much more explicit than those with an identifiable user might be.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Skout</strong></p>
<p>This is a flirting app that allows users to sign up as teens or adults. They&#8217;re then placed in the appropriate peer group, where they can post to a feed, comment on others&#8217; posts, add pictures, and chat. They&#8217;ll get notifications when other users near their geographic area join, and they can search other areas by cashing in points. They receive notifications when someone &#8220;checks&#8221; them out but must pay points to see who it is.</p>
<p><em>What parents need to know</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If your teens are going to use a dating app, Skout is probably the safest choice, if only because it has a teens-only section that seems to be moderated reasonably well.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no age verification. This makes it easy for a teen to say their older than 18 and an adult to say their younger.</li>

                        <p>The following apps were all created to hide things away from others. Many of the apps require additional PIN numbers to access the “hidden” material. Some of the apps even go as far as calling itself a calculator and looking/functioning like a calculator, to only have a PIN unlock a secret hidden vault of items.</p>
<p>Parents should be wary and start asking questions if they see any of the following apps on their child’s device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Private Photo Vault</strong></p>
<p>This allows users to import photos into albums and hide them behind a PIN lock. Beyond basic password protection, the app has two other bonus features called &#8220;break-in report&#8221; and &#8220;decoy password.&#8221; If someone tries to enter the app, it will secretly take a photo of the person and log their GPS location so you can see who was trying to access your private photos. Users also have the option to set up a decoy password that launches a different set of pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gallery Lock Lite</strong></p>
<p>Unlike other apps, Gallery Lock Lite lets you put the app icon in &#8220;Stealth Mode,&#8221; so it doesn&#8217;t appear on your phone. If you opt for this feature, you&#8217;ll have to access the app by typing in an asterisk, your password and pressing &#8220;Call.&#8221; Gallery Lock Lite will also catch a photo of any intruder with your phone&#8217;s front-facing camera after three failed password attempts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Best Secret Folder</strong></p>
<p>This app is used by people who don&#8217;t want anyone to know that they downloaded a privacy app. The icon is disguised as &#8220;My Utilities,&#8221; so no one will ever guess there are private photos tucked away in a phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Keep Safe</strong></p>
<p>This is a simple app with basic password protection for photos and videos. Users simply type in a PIN and import photos to albums in the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>KYMS</strong></p>
<p>This app&#8217;s icon is disguised as a calculator with the label of Ky-Calc. When the app is launched, a fully functional calculator appears. All a user has to do is punch in a 4-digit PIN number and the equal sign, and they have access to hidden contents. Along with hidden photos, you can store PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations and text files. KYMS allows you to import media from your computer, camera roll, the web and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vaulty</strong></p>
<p>In addition to password-protected galleries, Vaulty allows users to edit photos, sort and filter files, and create multiple vaults with different passwords. It hide photos and videos. Like similar apps, Vaulty includes a &#8220;mugshot&#8221; feature, with which it snaps a photo of anyone who enters the incorrect password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PhotoVault </strong></p>
<p>Specifically designed for hiding photos, PhotoVault differs from other apps because it has public and private galleries. The Private gallery is password-protected for hidden photos, and the Public gallery is accessible to anyone on your phone. Users can choose to set the app to open in Public mode, so it appears to be like any other photo app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bonus “Hidden” Album in iOS8 and iOS9</strong></p>
<p>Although this isn&#8217;t the most secure way to hide photos, it is an alternative to downloading a privacy app. With Apple&#8217;s iOS 8 update, users have the option to &#8220;hide&#8221; a photo from your Collections album. The hidden album is not password-protected, so anyone can still access it.</p>

                        <p>Social media, when used correctly, can a powerful tool for students and teachers in the classroom. There is a myth that if students are allowed to use social media in the classroom, then students will do nothing but tweet, send messages and chat while we are trying to teach. Social media if used properly can allow students, teachers and parents the greater ability to communication, collaborate, and think critically.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways in which some of our teachers are using social media in the classroom:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tweet or post status updates as a class. Teachers let students propose nuggets of learning that are posted for parents to read. Many teachers and administrators are tweeting about the positive things going on in the District.</li>
<li>Connect to other classrooms through social media. Teachers have connected with other classrooms in other countries to discuss social studies and diversity issues.</li>
<li>Students are creating videos and sharing them via YouTube.</li>
<li>Teachers are using social media to connect with other teachers around the world to create personal learning networks (PLNs) that allow teachers to learn from each other.</li>
<li>Numerous teachers and administrators have blogs in which they post updates for events and activities in their classroom or buildings.</li>
<li>Numerous teachers have created Facebook groups that are specifically for their classes, in which students can communicate in forming study groups or project groups.</li>
<li>Teachers are using Pinterest to find creative projects to use with their students.</li>
<li>Teachers are using Skype to communicate with authors, business professionals and people of interest.</li>
