            <div class="content">
                <article id="story-body">Pickerington Schools have been recognized for taking steps to prepare for cardiac arrest incidents in each of the district&#8217;s 14 buildings by obtaining <a href="http://www.sads.org/HSSA-1#.V_FoSJMrJ0s" target="_blank">HEARTSafe School Accreditation</a> for every building in the district.The district is believed to be the first in the country to hold the designation districtwide.</p>

<p>The HEARTSafe School Accreditation program is an initiative started in 2013 by Fairfield Medical Center and the Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes Foundation.</p>
<p>It has continued through a partnership between SADS, the cardiovascular institute and the Snider Community Heart Watch by which accreditation is granted to schools that meet criteria designed to ensure safety of students, staff and school visitors who might suffer sudden cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Those criteria include having students undergo pediatric sudden cardiac arrest risk assessments, development of care plans for students with cardiac medical diagnoses and the establishment of medical emergency response drills.</p>
<p>Additionally, automated external defibrillators must be available through the schools, their CPR-trained staff to student ratio must be one to 50 or better, CPR instruction must be provided to students as part of classroom instruction and education on sudden cardiac arrest in youth must be provided annually.</p>

                        <p>State-mandated health screenings (such as vision and hearing) are completed during the school year. Please contact your school nurse if you have concerns regarding your child and the screening process.</p>
<p>Vision screenings are done for all new students and those in preschool, kindergarten, and grades one, three, five, seven, and nine. Hearing screenings are performed with preschool, kindergarten, first, third, fifth, ninth, eleventh, and new students. Referrals letters are sent home if the school nurse suspects a concern or if the student fails a screening.</p>
<p>Vision screenings are not meant to replace comprehensive eye exams, but can help find children at risk for eye problems.</p>
<p>Sometimes, parents or teachers can tell if a child is having a problem. Squinting, complaining of things appearing blurry, or holding reading material close to their face may be signs. Other signs may be less obvious. Sometimes having a short attention span or losing interest in activities that require students to use their eyes for an extended period of time may signal a vision concern. Children who lose their place when reading may be having difficulty seeing. Avoiding reading, drawing, writing or other close activities may also be a sign of a vision problem. Children with vision problems may also turn their heads to the side when looking at an object in front of them to see it better.</p>
<p>Success in school is closely tied to eye health. The earlier a vision concern is found and treated, the better off your child will be. Please contact your child’s school nurse if you have any questions about vision and hearing screenings.</p>

                        <p>Pickerington Schools operate using no exclusion evidenced-based practice, which means that a student suspected or confirmed to have head lice or nits shall remain in school and is not isolated or otherwise subjected to restrictions of activities.</p>
<p>The student’s parent or guardian shall be informed that their child is suspected of being infested by head lice and will be offered information and guidance on the biology and management of the condition. It is expected that the parent or guardian will provide appropriate treatment for the condition and the student will return to school the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Management of Head Lice and Nits</strong></p>
<p>PLSD operates on a no exclusion evidenced-based practice supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Association of School Nurses.</p>
<p>Reminders to staff and parents or guardians on lice prevention and management will be sent home to families at regular intervals throughout the school year in an effort to sustain a positive attitude toward containment of head lice/nits and discourage head-to-head contact.</p>
<p>When a school staff member is notified by a parent or guardian that a student has lice, the staff member will notify the building school nurse. The school nurse will contact the parent or guardian to provide information about diagnosis and management of lice. The nurse will offer services (if needed) to support the family.</p>
<p>Confidentiality of a student with suspected or confirmed lice or nits will be maintained.</p>
<p>By the end of the school day, the school nurse will notify parents or guardians of students with suspected lice or nits by phone. The student will not be excluded from school and may be transported home by bus.</p>
<p>The school nurse and building principal shall work with the parents and guardians of any student who has been determined to have a chronic infestation of head lice. This will be done through advocating for the education of staff, students, and parents or guardians about head lice and promoting evidenced-based management for students with head lice.</p>
<p><strong>What are head lice?</strong></p>
<p>Head lice are tiny, wingless insects that live close to the human scalp. They feed on blood. The eggs, also called nits, are tiny, tear-drop shaped eggs that attach to the hair shaft. Nits often appear yellowish or white and can look like dandruff but cannot be removed or brushed off. The nymph, or baby louse, is smaller and grow to adult size in one to two weeks. The adult louse is the size of a sesame seed appears tan to grayish-white. An itchy and inflamed scalp is a common symptom of lice. Although not common, persistent scratching may lead to skin irritation and even infection.</p>
<p><strong>Who is affected by head lice?</strong></p>
<p>Head lice are not related to cleanliness. In fact, head lice often infest people with good hygiene and grooming habits. Infestations can occur at home, school or in the community. Head lice are mostly spread by direct head-to-head contact—for example, during play at home or school, slumber parties, sports activities or camp. Less often, lice are spread via objects that have been in recent contact with a person with head lice, such as hats, scarves, hair ribbons, combs, brushes, stuffed animals or bedding.</p>
<p><strong>What to do if an infestation occurs?</strong></p>
<p>If you think your child has head lice, it’s important to talk to a healthcare provider to discuss the best treatment approach for your family. Resistance to some over-the-counter head lice treatments has been reported, but the prevalence of resistance is not known. There are new prescription treatment options available that are safe and do not require nit combing.</p>

                        <p class="">Bed bugs have been an issue in Central Ohio for several years.</p>
<p class="">Bed bugs are a nuisance, but their bites are not known to spread disease. Bed bugs are usually active at night and feed on human blood. The bite does not hurt at first, but may become swollen and itch, much like a mosquito bite.</p>
<p class="">Symptoms of exposure include clusters of bites, usually in a line on exposed areas of the body. If you have medical concerns for you or your child, please contact your doctor.</p>
<p class="">The source of bed bugs often cannot be determined. Bed bugs may be found in many places, including hotels, planes, and movie theaters. They can be found anywhere, not only in &#8220;dirty&#8221; locations.</p>
<p class="">It is unlikely for bed bugs to infest a school, but Pickerington Schools inspects as necessary and, if needed, will work with licensed pest control specialists assist with management if needed.</p>
<p class="">Contact your physician or school nurse for proper care and treatment of bed bug bites.</p>
<p class="">If you have any questions regarding bed bugs in your home, refer to the Central Ohio Bed Bug Task Force website at <a href="http://www.centralohiobedbugs.org/">www.centralohiobedbugs.org</a>.</p>

                        <p>Pertussis  (whooping cough) is a serious respiratory illness spread through face-to-face contact and by being in confined spaces for extended periods of time with those who already have whooping cough. That is part of the reason the illness tends to be transmitted within close-knit student groups, such as athletic teams.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for the district to have cases of whooping cough each year. Some important facts about pertussis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pertussis is most contagious early on, before symptoms become severe.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Early symptoms can be mild, resembling a mild cough, cold, or allergies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Vaccines help protect your child, but do not guarantee that your child will not get pertussis. Everyone’s body is different and protection can decrease over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your child has been exposed and has these symptoms, even if they are mild, please see your doctor for testing. Keep in mind that the classic “whoop” sound, fits of coughing, and vomiting after coughing often don’t appear until later. Also, vaccinated children may have a milder illness due to the protection they have. However, even mild illness is contagious.</p>
<p><strong>What should parents do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your child home when they are sick.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If your child is tested, please keep your child home from school while awaiting results.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If your child is diagnosed, he/she must stay home for 5 full 24-hour days after starting the antibiotic.</li>
</ul>

                        <p><strong>Encourage good hand washing.</strong> According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) the number one method for controlling the spread of disease is hand washing. Make sure you use soap, warm water, and wash all surfaces of the hands. A simple way to ensure you have washed long enough is to silently sing the “Happy Birthday” song to yourself twice while washing. Follow washing with a good rinse, pat hands dry, and use the towel to turn off the faucet to avoid getting hands dirty again. Wash hands after blowing the nose, playing with pets, before eating, after using the restroom, or when they are visible dirty.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure your child gets enough sleep each night.</strong> Children should get between nine and ten hours of sleep each night in order to feel rested. Those who do not get enough sleep are often groggy, irritable, and have decreased alertness in school. It’s easy to see how school performance and behavior are negatively affected when children are not rested.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure your child eats breakfast each day.</strong> Studies have shown that children who eat breakfast actually do better on tests, and are better able to fight off disease and infection. Breakfast should consist of wholesome nourishing foods such as cereal, fruit, juice, milk, eggs, peanut butter, toast, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Encourage your child to drink plenty of water.</strong> Many of the complaints that bring students to the clinic can be attributed to dehydration, such as headaches, stomachaches, sore throats and nosebleeds.</p>
<p><strong>Dress your child appropriately for the weather.</strong> Children who are too hot or too cold will have difficulty concentrating. During the winter months hats decrease heat loss through the head, and gloves protect against frostbite. Proper footwear should also be considered: boots during snowy times, shoes and socks during more mild weather. “Flip-flops” are never appropriate footwear for school.</p>
<p><strong>Cover your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing.</strong> Cold and flu germs are spread though the air. Covering the mouth and nose can decrease the spread of germs. Teach your student to cough/sneeze into his/ her bent elbow, thus decreasing the amount of germs in the air, and keeping the hands cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your student home if he/she has a fever.</strong> For school purposes, a fever is 100 degrees F. Your child needs to be fever free for 24 hours without the use of medication prior to returning to school. Even if your child feels better, fevers often return if he/she is sent to school too soon. Keeping your child home will also help limit the spread of disease to other students.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your student home if he/she vomits during the night.</strong> As with fevers, vomiting often occurs again if the child is sent to school too soon. Keeping him/her home allows for rest and recovery, and protects other students from exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Follow directions on medication prescribed for your child.</strong> If your child has been prescribed antibiotics or eye drops for pink eye, please make sure the medication is completed, even if your child feels or looks better. This medication must be taken in its entirety in order to ensure the condition is resolved. Failure to finish antibiotics may allow the condition to return.</p>
<p><strong>Consider your home environment.</strong> Remember the old adage: Children learn what they live. Modeling healthy behavior can help your child learn healthy habits. Children are more likely to adopt healthy behaviors such as good diet, daily exercise, and not smoking when the home environment encourages it. Also, studies have shown that second hand smoke increases the likelihood of respiratory illness in children.</p>
