<p>Will March come in like a lamb or a lion? It’s hard to believe that we’ll soon find out! I’d like to ask that you pay particular attention to the dates listed in this and the next two newsletters. There are many important events coming up this spring of which you will want to be aware.</p>
<p>First, I would like to draw your attention to the state testing dates for grades 3 &amp; 4, which are March-28-31.   It is especially important that your child report to school on time on these days. Please refer to specific information in this newsletter. Remember the first bell rings at 9:05 a.m. with the tardy bell ringing at 9:15 a.m. Students need to be in their class by 9:15 a.m. in order to participate in testing on these days.</p>
<p>In addition, please review your child’s teacher’s classroom newsletter/webpage. It contains information about upcoming classroom activities.</p>
<p>Our spring break will be March 20-24. Classes resume March, 27.</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing to provide a quality educational experience for your child over the next three months.</p>
<p>Educationally Yours,</p>
<p>Kristi Motsch</p>

<p>Growing Leaders</p>

<p>Parents, please remember to sign in and take a badge from the office when you enter the building. You should always enter from the front, office entrance. Wearing a badge lets our staff know that you have officially signed in with the office. If you are dropping off items for your child, we will call them to the office to limit classroom interruptions. We are very protective of our instructional time and we try to maximize our teachers’ time with students. We appreciate your understanding and your help in limiting classroom interruptions.</p>

                        <p><strong><u>Kindergarten Registration</u></strong></p>
<p>Kindergarten registration for Fall 2017 begins in the district Thursday, March 16, 2017. Please contact our Welcome Center at 614-920-6140 for 2016-17 Kindergarten Registration. Due to the high number of callers, our staff and phone lines at the Welcome Center may be very busy at the beginning of kindergarten registration. Thank you for your patience!</p>
<p>Children must be at least 5 years old by Aug. 1, 2017, to be registered for kindergarten this fall. The district offers half-day kindergarten in both morning and afternoon sessions. Parents may request a morning or afternoon preference. Depending on the number of parents with preferences, a lottery may be held to determine placement.</p>
<p>Parents may register online through Infinite Campus starting on that date. Access to the kindergarten registration system will be open by approximately 9 a.m. that morning. After filling out the basic registration information, parents will receive an email with details about contacting the district’s Welcome Center to arrange an appointment to sign paperwork. At that time, parents also will set an appointment for a readiness assessment for their children. Those assessments will be held April 24, 25 and 27 at Violet Baptist Church, 8345 Blacklick-Eastern Road (S.R. 204).</p>
<p><strong>How do I know if my child is ready for kindergarten?</strong></p>
<p>Assuming your child will be 5 years old by Aug. 1, the district will perform an assessment. This year, those assessments will be April 24, 25 and 27 at Violet Baptist Church, 8345 Blacklick-Eastern Road (S.R. 204). These individual screenings (called Bracken assessments) are performed by trained district educators. They are only used by the district to help teachers determine where to begin teaching individual children. The Bracken assessment tests children on skills such as identifying common colors by name, identifying upper case and lower case letters, identifying single and double-digit numbers, counting objects, demonstrating a basic knowledge of words used to depict size, identifying shapes, and matching or differentiating objects based on specific characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Find complete information about kindergarten registration and assessments on our website at</strong><strong> </strong><strong>http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/news/2017-18-kindergarten-registration-starts-march-17/.</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>OPEN ENROLLMENT REQUESTS FOR 2017-2018 DEADLINE – March 30, 2017</u></strong></p>
<p>Form is available on the district website under District forms, Enrolling and Open enrollment. The application is necessary for the district to consider allowing students to attend a school outside their normal attendance boundaries. Interested K-6 parents must submit an application each year they are requesting intradistrict open enrollment. Application is not a guarantee that students will be open enrolled. Approval is based on staffing and space availability.</p>

                        <p>TIPS FOR A HEALTHY HEART</p>
<p>Heart disease is the #1 killer in the United States today. This is not just a disease that affects men, but also women and children. While heredity may play a big part in whether you or a family member gets heart disease, we all can choose to reduce our risk by living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Better lifestyle habits can help you reduce you and your families risk for heart disease, heart attack, and stroke. Choosing the right foods and preparing them the right way will provide health benefits. Learning about dietary fats when eating out and cooking at home is very important. Not all fats are created equal. Saturated and trans fats will clog arteries and promote the development of heart disease. Mono saturated and poly saturated fats including those rich in omega3 are a healthy choice and they will prevent the development of heart disease.</p>
<p>Managing your weight through healthy eating plus exercise will improve your overall health. To maintain a healthy weight, there must be an equal balance of the calories you take in with the calories your body burns. This will enable you to maintain your weight. To do this you must keep track of the calories you take in and the ones that you burn. Get yourself into a habit of recording these numbers and you will be surprised of the health benefit.</p>
<p>Choose exercise activities that you enjoy-you will increase your chances of sticking with it. Make it a family fun time; go for bike rides, swimming, walking, play ball, or any activity that gives you a workout. There are several fitness programs available on the American Heart Association (AHA) website at <a href="http://www.americanheart.org">www.americanheart.org</a>. Also on this website is a section specifically for kids. The AHA is working to raise public awareness about the serious effects child obesity poses for children. There are several related links and resources available.</p>

<p>Ohio’s Students in Grades 1-6 Encouraged to Participate in the 2017 Severe Weather Awareness Poster Contest</p>
<p>Columbus, OH – The Ohio Committee for Severe Weather Awareness is looking for students in first through sixth grades, including specialized instruction classes, to participate in its annual poster contest. The purpose of the severe weather awareness poster contest is to engage Ohio’s youth in learning the importance of severe weather safety and to demonstrate through illustrations, actions they can take before, during and after severe weather events to protect themselves and others.</p>
<p>Tornadoes, floods, thunder and lightning storms, extreme heat, and winter storms are weather conditions that typically affect the state.</p>
<p>“As educators, parents and mentors, we are committed to teach safety and preparedness to our students – our children,” said Sima Merick, executive director of the Ohio Emergency Management Agency. “Because Ohio has had mild winters two years in a row, it kind of opens us up to more rain and wind events. We’ve seen multiple days of 60-degree weather this winter. So, we really need to be prepared for anything: heavy rain, snowstorms, even tornadoes. This poster contest provides the perfect opportunity for students to learn about Ohio weather and severe weather safety and preparedness.”</p>
<p>Ohio schools have until Monday, April 17 to send their first-place posters (per grade) to their regional National Weather Service offices. The NWS offices will judge all poster entries and choose their top regional winners, per grade. Then in early May, the Severe Weather Awareness Committee will judge the top regional posters to determine the state and overall state winners.</p>
<p>Schools will be notified of their regional winners by the end of May. All regional winners will be invited to attend the poster contest awards ceremony, which will be held at the Ohio State Fair’s Janis Center on Saturday, July 29.</p>
<p>The prizes are big and the day’s event is fun. All regional winners will receive two entry passes for the day at the Ohio State Fair. All regional-winning students will receive a host of prizes, certificates and awards. State-level winners for each grade will receive additional prizes, and the overall state winner will receive even more, along with a personalized trophy. The overall winner’s school will be loaned a “traveling trophy” to showcase during the school year.</p>
<p>For complete rules and forms to participate in the poster contest, visit the Ohio Committee for Severe Weather Awareness website at www.weathersafety.ohio.gov or click here.</p>
<p>The Ohio Committee for Severe Weather Awareness is comprised of 16 organizations and state agencies that are dedicated in teaching Ohioans severe weather safety and preparedness.</p>

<td>February 2017As our staff looks forward to this semester, it is equally important for us to refer back to our earlier work this year. One document that we use to guide us is our building continuous improvement plan.This plan was developed by our Building Leadership Team, and acts as a vehicle to move us towards better instruction. These plans have led us, as both educators and learners, to effective methods that improve student learning &amp; generate more authentic teaching practices. We acknowledge that our students need to be competent in communication (oral &amp; written), collaboration, and critical thinking skills.Providing lessons that utilize these practices makes learning more relevant to our students. I am excited and honored to continue our journey towards offering the highest quality services for your children.Educationally Yours,Kristi Motsch, PrincipalGrowing Leaders</td>

<p>Dear Toll Gate Elementary Parents,<br />
The Holiday Season is quickly approaching, along with all the joy and memories it brings.  However, it is not a joyous time for all families due to financial hardship or difficult family situations.  PLSD is once again partnering with the Violet Fire Department to collect toys and gift cards for families within our school district.  <strong>If you are out and about and can pick up needed items, please bring or send them to Toll Gate Elementary School on the week of December 5th &#8211; 9th</strong>. We will have a large red collection box in front of the Media Center</p>

<p><strong>The clinic is in need of clothing for when the unexpected happens!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The following items are needed:</strong></p>
<p><strong>**Socks (new)—all sizes</strong></p>
<p><strong>**Underwear (new): Boys and Girls – small 6-8 medium 8-10, large 10-14</strong></p>
<p><strong>**Sweatshirts, sweatpants (new or gently used) …gender neutral</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sizes: S 6-8, M 8-10, L 10-12, XL 14.    </strong></p>
<p><strong>You can leave the items in the office. </strong></p>
<p>Holiday Stress and Children</p>
<p>Help your child beat the holiday stress by following these tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Limit TV and video games</strong> It may be easier to let the TV or video games occupy your child’s time, however, children who are stressed need some type of physical activity or exercise. Physical activity is a great way to decrease stress in everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Remember routines</strong> Routines are very important to children. During the holiday season, children’s routines can be disrupted with shopping expeditions and special events. When a routine is broken, stress can result. Try to keep your child on their routine to keep the stress level down.</li>
<li><strong>Family traditions</strong> are very important to children. They offer comfort and security. Enjoy the family traditions you have started. Some traditions to try might be, baking cookies, reading holiday books together, or visiting an elderly person.</li>
<li><strong> Attitude check</strong> Both children and parents need to have an attitude check before the holiday season begins. Take a deep breath, and have everyone in the family pledge to make the holiday season a time of joy and peace. With the right attitude, everyone can enjoy the holiday season.</li>
<li><strong>Nutrition</strong> Eating healthy helps us to stay well. Plan at least one healthy meal as a family everyday. Remember to toss in a healthy snack while you’re out shopping.</li>
<li><strong>Rest and relaxation</strong> Everyone, especially children need to take a “time out” over the holiday season to rest and relax. When a child is well rested, they will enjoy the holiday activities better. Schedule some R&amp;R time for everyone in the family.</li>
<li><strong> Laugh</strong>  Laughter is still the best way to beat stress and change everyone’s mood from bad to good. Take time to read the comics to your children or find a holiday joke book with family humor at your bookstore or library.</li>
</ol>
<p>The holiday season does not have to be a time of stress and exhaustion. Hopefully, following these simple tips will help reduce the holiday stress in your family.</p>

                        <p>Petermann Transportation Bus Company has provided a mobile app, which parents can use to track their children’s buses.  The new version can be downloaded at http://www.petermannbus.com/Pages/PetermannBusTracker.aspx</p>
<p>Parents will need their children’s student ID number to set up the app.</p>
<p>Petermann will have the ability to communicate directly with parents about bus delays and other issues.  Please be reminded not to use the system to wait until the last minute to send their child to the bus stop.  Students should be at designated stop by the scheduled bus arrival time, and waiting until last minute can be dangerous if children are running to meet their bus.</p>
<p>The system operates by tracking the GPS units in each bus, so it operates on a lag that can be up to two minutes.  During that time the bus may have made progress on its route, so GPS locations are only approximate.</p>

<p>We are proud to announce that we will be reviewed this spring for Lighthouse status. This means that a review team will visit our school and rate our progress.</p>
<p>Our journey began three years ago when our staff began training and preparing to become a Leader in Me School. Through book studies, formal training, and school site visits we learned more about the powerful impact of students recognizing their strengths as leaders. I can truly say that over the last three years, students are more involved in their learning by goal setting, data tracking, and identifying their strengths. We look forward to continuing this educational journey with your family.</p>
<p>Educationally Yours,</p>

<p>Because students are our most precious resource, we care deeply about their safety. We ask all visitors to sign in and obtain a visitors pass to be in the school or on the playground.  Parents are asked to respect the teacher’s duty to provide instruction from 9:15 a.m. – 4:05 p.m. We try to limit the number of classroom interruptions during the school day. Please make sure that your child brings their homework, lunch money, projects, etc to school in the morning. In addition, if you are interested in visiting your child’s classroom, please make arrangements in advance with the teacher according to our districts’ policy which is displayed by the front office door</p>

                        <p><strong><u>DISMISSAL CHANGES</u></strong></p>
<p>While we all know that consistency in important in a child’s life, it may become necessary to change your child’s dismissal plans. If you must change the way your child is to be dismissed, we ask that you follow the following procedures:</p>
<p>1)   Send a note <u>in advance</u> to your child’s teacher. They will then inform the office.</p>
<p>2)    Please allow enough time for you to come into the building to sign your child out. Students will be called from class to meet you in the office.</p>
<p>3)    We ask that you do not call the office after <strong>2:30 p.m</strong>. with alternate plans for your child. This causes interruptions to the classroom instruction and with almost 625 students and 5 different grade level schedules; it takes an inordinate amount of time out of the school day. We thank you in advance for your cooperation<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Emergency School Dismissal:</p>
<p><strong><u>EMERGENCY SCHOOL DISMISSAL</u></strong></p>
<p>During the course of the school year, it may become necessary to send the children home due to an emergency. Weather, electrical outage, or other types of emergencies as determined by emergency personnel could cause an emergency dismissal. These emergency situations could occur suddenly leaving no time for parent notification other than radio announcement. In order to help our staff prepare for any such emergency, please complete the Calamity Form included in your back to school folder.</p>
<p>Please list on the form the instructions your child is to follow when leaving school and returning home. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they know how to enter your home?</li>
<li>Do they go to the neighbors?</li>
<li>Who do they call when they arrive?</li>
<li>Do they have a list of phone numbers?</li>
<li>Do they ride another bus with a friend?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, our phone system does not operate during electrical outages and waiting at school to be picked up is NOT an option if we are told to evacuate by emergency personnel. Please take time to consider your emergency plan and help us keep your child safe.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>The state mandated Vision and Hearing screenings are in the process of being done for all Kindergarten, 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> graders. If your student does not pass, you will be notified that further assessment by a professional eye or ear specialist is recommended. If your child is not in Kindergarten, 1<sup>st</sup>, 3rd or 5<sup>th</sup> grade, and you are concerned about their vision or hearing, please let me know and I will gladly do a screening for your student. Also, as we get closer to cold and flu season, please remember to follow the district guidelines in regards to medications at school as well as keeping your child home when ill. You can find the details for this information in the packet of information sent home at the beginning of the school year, as well as at the Health Services section of the PLSD website:</p>

<p><strong>FLU SEASON IS COMING</strong></p>
<p>Which of these symptoms describe influenza?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea.</li>
<li>Runny nose, sneezing and normal temperature.</li>
<li>High fever, headache and cough.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you picked #3, you are right! Vomiting and diarrhea are not the flu at all, but you will hear many people saying they have “the flu” with these symptoms. Actually they may have an infection in their stomach or intestinal system called gastroenteritis.</p>
<p>A cold is described in #2. Headaches and fever do not commonly occur with a cold, but cold symptoms are present with influenza. You may also have body aches, feel tired, have chills, a cough and a sore throat with the flu.</p>
<p>Like many illnesses, the influenza virus is spread from the respiratory tract. If the mouth or nose is exposed to the virus particles in the air, or on a surface that has been contaminated with the virus, you are likely to get sick with influenza. Someone is contagious from one day before symptoms start until five days after becoming ill. You can help to prevent illnesses by using good personal hygiene. Persons with colds or the flu need to cover their mouths when sneezing or coughing. Then immediately afterward wash their hands because any article they touch after sneezing may carry a virus. The other way to prevent spreading the illness is by washing your own hands frequently. This is especially true before eating.</p>
<p>The best way to prevent getting infected by the influenza virus is by getting a flu vaccine every year. The earlier in the season that you get the shot, the stronger your immunity will be to fight the virus. The flu vaccine is safe and recommended for most of the population. The people who should not get the vaccine are children under six months of age, those with a severe egg allergy, having a history of developing Guillain-Barreí syndrome after a previous vaccine, and people who have a moderate or severe illness accompanied by a fever (you just need to wait until the fever is gone before getting the vaccine).</p>
<p>The vaccine is especially recommended for those at high risk, which include children from 6 months to 19 years, pregnant women, people over 50, those with a chronic medical condition and those living with or caring for those who are at high risk of getting the flu. The flu vaccine contains killed virus with which the body will build defenses. Since there is no live virus in the vaccine, you cannot get ill from getting the flu shot.</p>
<p>See if you can identify the true statements from the myths.</p>
<p><u>True</u> or <u>False</u> (answers at bottom of the page)</p>
<ol>
<li>More than 200,000 people each year have complications from the flu that put them in the hospital.</li>
<li>People with asthma should not get the vaccine.</li>
<li>It is not safe to return to work or school after resting for a day or two of having the flu since you are still contagious.</li>
<li>You have to get a new shot every year, because different viruses cause the flu each year.</li>
<li>Over the counter medications can help relieve some of the symptoms of the flu.</li>
<li>The flu can be diarrhea and vomiting rather than cold like symptoms.</li>
<li>A cough can last for weeks to months after the other flu symptoms disappear.</li>
<li>When sick with the flu, you need to drink a lot of liquid and get plenty of rest.</li>
<li>One last note, if you or a loved one comes down with flu symptoms, you should go to your doctor right away. If caught in the first day or two, the doctor may give you anti-viral medication that will decrease the symptoms and length of your illness. Some great Internet resources about influenza are:</li>

                        <p>Welcome to the 2016-2017 school year! We are looking forward to seeing all of you and providing excellent educational opportunities for our children.</p>
<p>We would like to ask that you go to the Back to School Page on our website and review the forms now located online and follow the directions where indicated. Pay particular attention to the Student Handbook and digitally signing the acknowledgement that you have read the handbook. A registration card will be coming home with your child on the first day of school. Please fill that out and return so we have the correct contact information.</p>
<p>Please make sure you have signed up in Infinite Campus for a parent portal account. You can start this process online by   going to the top right of the district website under the “I want to box”.   Scroll down to the “Access Infinite Campus” to start the process. By registering for a parent account you will automatically receive important school information, such as upcoming school events and cancelations due to bad weather. Our goal is to provide efficient communication to our school community. I would also encourage you to frequently visit Toll Gate Elementary’s webpage for current information of upcoming events. Our webpage can be accessed by going to our district’s website at www.pickerington.k12.oh.us Click “Schools” at the top and scroll down to Toll Gate Elementary.</p>

                        <p>To serve the requirements of child custody order, a parent should present an official order to be placed on record for the guidance, attendance and administrative offices. Ohio Revised Code 3313.673 states for“…the custodial parent of the child shall notify the school of those custodial arrangements…” Our primary concern is knowing who is the legal custodian, residential parent, and knowing the answer to the question, “Can your child be dismissed to a non-custodial parent?” Schools are obligated to follow court documentation regarding the rights of a non-custodial parent.</p>

The Safe School Help line allows students/parents to anonymously report wrongdoing and have this information reported to school officials. The toll free number assigned to our school district is 1-800-418-6423, ext. 359. When you dial this number, you will be instructed as to how to leave your information. We hope that any information, which could negatively impact our school, will be reported, so that the staff can respond in an appropriate manner to keep our schools safe for all students.</p>
