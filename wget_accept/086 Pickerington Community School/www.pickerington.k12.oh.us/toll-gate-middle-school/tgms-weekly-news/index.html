                        <p>Our Outdoor Education is a three-day, two-night camp experience at Heartland Environmental School in Marengo, Ohio.  Outdoor Education for sixth grade students is scheduled for Nov. 13 -15, 2017. This resident Outdoor Education program helps students appreciate their environment in ways not attainable through a classroom setting. The camp fee includes: 24-hour medical care, meals, snacks, insurance, lodging, the use of the facilities, and a camp T-shirt.<br />
In order to help defray the costs for all of our families we will be offering four ODE fundraisers in the coming weeks.  These events will help our 5th grade students attend camp but the fun is open to everyone.<br />
        Join us for the following special theme days  &#8211; all proceeds will benefit the Outdoor Education Fund &#8211; 2017!<br />

                        <p>Children must be at least 5 years old by Aug. 1, 2017, to be registered for kindergarten this fall. The district offers half-day kindergarten in both morning and afternoon sessions. Parents may request a morning or afternoon preference. Depending on the number of parents with preferences, a lottery may be held to determine placement.<br />
Parents may register online through Infinite Campus starting on that date. Access to the kindergarten registration system will be open by approximately 9 a.m. that morning. After filling out the basic registration information, parents will receive an email with details about contacting the district’s Welcome Center to arrange an appointment to sign paperwork. At that time, parents also will set an appointment for a readiness assessment for their children. Those assessments will be held April 24, 25 and 27 at Violet Baptist Church, 8345 Blacklick-Eastern Road (S.R. 204).<br />
How do I know if my child is ready for kindergarten?<br />
Assuming your child will be 5 years old by Aug. 1, the district will perform an assessment. This year, those assessments will be April 24, 25 and 27 at Violet Baptist Church, 8345 Blacklick-Eastern Road (S.R. 204). These individual screenings (called Bracken assessments) are performed by trained district educators. They are only used by the district to help teachers determine where to begin teaching individual children.<br />
The Bracken assessment tests children on skills such as identifying common colors by name, identifying upper case and lower case letters, identifying single and double-digit numbers, counting objects, demonstrating a basic knowledge of words used to depict size, identifying shapes, and matching or differentiating objects based on specific characteristics.<br />
Find complete information about kindergarten registration and assessments on our website at http://www.pickerington.k12.oh.us/news/2017-18-kindergarten-registration-starts-march-17/.</p>

                        <p>Toll Gate Middle School will once again be participating in projects that give back to the community.  Classrooms will be raising money through various activities in order to help area families during the holiday season.  Pickerington Schools are teaming up, once again, with the Violet Township Fire Department to help provide some assistance for families in need during this holiday season.  A collection box for the Violet Township Fire Department Holiday Toy Drive is located in the Main Office.</p>
<p>We will be selling candy canes each morning in the cafeteria from Dec. 5-9 to benefit our holiday outreach.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support of our service projects.  In the midst of what is always a very hectic season, pausing for just a moment to discuss a simple act of charity can add significant meaning to your family’s holiday, as well as throughout the rest of the year.</p>

                        <p>Before the end of this year, parents should replace the current “bus tracker” mobile application with Petermann Transportation’s new and improved version.<br />
Petermann Transportation has updated its mobile app, which parents can use to track their children’s buses. The new version can be downloaded at http://www.petermannbus.com/Pages/PetermannBusTracker.aspx</p>
<p>Parents will need their children’s student ID numbers to set up the app.</p>
<p>The new app improves functionality from the old version, including giving Petermann Transportation the ability to communicate directly with parents about bus delays and other issues.</p>
<p>Parents are reminded that they should not use the system to wait until the very last minute to send their children to the bus stop. Students must be at their designated stop by the scheduled bus arrival time, and waiting until the last minute can de dangerous if children are running to meet their bus.</p>
<p>Plus, the system operates by tracking the GPS units in each bus, so it operates on a lag that can be up to two minutes. During that time, the bus may have made progress on its route, so GPS locations are only approximate.</p>

                        <p>Three Pickerington schools have earned the Momentum Award from the Ohio State Board of Education, recognizing schools that exceed expectations in student growth for the year.</p>
<p>Diley Middle School, Toll Gate Middle School, and Toll Gate Elementary received this recognition. They were among just 169 Ohio schools and five in Fairfield County to be recognized.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the Momentum Award, schools must earn straight A’s on all value-added measures on the state report card. The school also must have at least two value-added subgroups of students, which include gifted, students with disabilities, and students in the lowest 20 percent of achievement.</p>
<p>The “value-added” measure is a gauge of whether a school ensured its students received a year’s worth of academic growth in reading and math within the 2015-16 school year.</p>
<p>This was the second year in a row Toll Gate Middle School received the award.</p>

                        <p>The state mandated Vision and Hearing screenings are in the process of being done for all Kindergarten, 1st, 3rd and 5th graders.  If your student does not pass, you will be notified that further assessment by a professional eye or ear specialist is recommended.  If your child is not in Kindergarten, 1st, 3rd or 5th grade, and you are concerned about their vision or hearing, please let me know and I will gladly do a screening for your student.<br />
Also, as we get closer to cold and flu season, please remember to follow the district guidelines in regards to medications at school as well as keeping your child home when ill.  You can find the details for this information in the packet of information sent home at the beginning of the school year, as well as at the Health Services section of the PLSD website:<br />

FLU SEASON IS COMING<br />
Which of these symptoms describe influenza?<br />
1.	Stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea.<br />
2.	Runny nose, sneezing and normal temperature.<br />
3.	High fever, headache and cough.</p>
<p>If you picked #3, you are right!  Vomiting and diarrhea are not the flu at all, but you will hear many people saying they have “the flu” with these symptoms.  Actually they may have an infection in their stomach or intestinal system called gastroenteritis.</p>
<p>A cold is described in #2.  Headaches and fever do not commonly occur with a cold, but cold symptoms are present with influenza.  You may also have body aches, feel tired, have chills, a cough and a sore throat with the flu.  </p>
<p>Like many illnesses, the influenza virus is spread from the respiratory tract.  If the mouth or nose is exposed to the virus particles in the air, or on a surface that has been contaminated with the virus, you are likely to get sick with influenza.  Someone is contagious from one day before symptoms start until five days after becoming ill. You can help to prevent illnesses by using good personal hygiene. Persons with colds or the flu need to cover their mouths when sneezing or coughing.  Then immediately afterward wash their hands because any article they touch after sneezing may carry a virus.  The other way to prevent spreading the illness is by washing your own hands frequently.  This is especially true before eating.  </p>
<p>The best way to prevent getting infected by the influenza virus is by getting a flu vaccine every year.  The earlier in the season that you get the shot, the stronger your immunity will be to fight the virus.  The flu vaccine is safe and recommended for most of the population.  The people who should not get the vaccine are children under six months of age, those with a severe egg allergy, having a history of developing Guillain-Barreí syndrome after a previous vaccine, and people who have a moderate or severe illness accompanied by a fever (you just need to wait until the fever is gone before getting the vaccine).</p>
<p>The vaccine is especially recommended for those at high risk, which include children from 6 months to 19 years, pregnant women, people over 50, those with a chronic medical condition and those living with or caring for those who are at high risk of getting the flu.  The flu vaccine contains killed virus with which the body will build defenses.  Since there is no live virus in the vaccine, you cannot get ill from getting the flu shot.</p>
<p>See if you can identify the true statements from the myths.<br />
True or False  (answers at bottom of the page)<br />
1.	More than 200,000 people each year have complications from the flu that put them in the hospital.<br />
2.	People with asthma should not get the vaccine.<br />
3.	It is not safe to return to work or school after resting for a day or two of having the flu since you are still contagious.<br />
4.	You have to get a new shot every year, because different viruses cause the flu each year.<br />
5.	Over the counter medications can help relieve some of the symptoms of the flu.<br />
6.	The flu can be diarrhea and vomiting rather than cold like symptoms.<br />
7.	A cough can last for weeks to months after the other flu symptoms disappear.<br />
8.	When sick with the flu, you need to drink a lot of liquid and get plenty of rest.</p>
<p>One last note, if you or a loved one comes down with flu symptoms, you should go to your doctor right away.  If caught in the first day or two, the doctor may give you anti-viral medication that will decrease the symptoms and length of your illness.  Some great Internet resources about influenza are:<br />

                        <p>October is Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Month<br />
In an ongoing effort to maintain our Heart Safe Schools, we would like to take this opportunity to remind parents about Sudden Cardiac Arrest and encourage you to read the information provided by the SADS Foundation.  </p>
<p>www.sads.org is website for Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes</p>
<p>Please take a moment to complete the risk assessment for each of your children and if you have any concerns, please discuss them with your health care provider.</p>
<p>The assessment can be found here as an attachment.<br />
If you have any questions, you may contact your child&#8217;s school nurse for assistance.</p>
<p>My nephew, Frankie, died at age 13 while running to the school bus one morning. My daughter was then diagnosed with LQTS &#038; has been taking medication for several years. —Patti</p>
<p>Remember…<br />
●	Most cardiac problems that may cause sudden death in the young can be diagnosed and treated.<br />
●	With treatment, people with these conditions can have normal, productive lives.<br />
●	Most sudden cardiac deaths in children are due to hereditary conditions, so every family member should be tested.<br />
●	All children should have the questionnaire completed—and be checked by a doctor if they answer “yes” to any question—before they participate in organized sports programs.</p>
<p>SADS’ Mission<br />
To save the lives and support the families of children &#038; young adults who are genetically predisposed to sudden death due to heart rhythm abnormalities.</p>
<p>	Is Your Child At Risk?<br />
Facts About Sudden Cardiac Death</p>
<p>Your child or a young person you know may be at risk for sudden cardiac death due to an inherited condition. He/she will appear healthy and, in most cases, you will have absolutely no idea that something might be wrong. Once diagnosed, these conditions are treatable!</p>
<p>About sudden cardiac death in the young:<br />
●	Each year in the United States, approximately 400,000 Americans die suddenly and unexpectedly due to cardiac arrhythmias. About 7,000 of those are young people under age 18. These deaths total more than lung cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined! (AHA Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics—2014 Update)<br />
●	These conditions include LQTS, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM), and Brugada Syndrome, among others.<br />
●	10-12% of SIDS is due to Long QT Syndrome (LQTS).<br />
●	LQTS is now known to be at least 3-4 times more common in the US than childhood leukemia.<br />
●	It is estimated a sports-related sudden cardiac death occurs every 3 days, equaling approximately 110 deaths per year. (Br J Sports Med 2013;47:1171-1174)<br />
●	Sudden cardiac death is one of the top five leading causes of death in<br />
young adults.</p>
<p>What you can do:<br />
●	You or your child’s doctor should fill out the questionnaire on the back of this form. If you answer yes to any of the questions, your doctor should check your child’s heart.<br />
●	If your child has any of the following signs, see your doctor:<br />
♥	Family history of unexpected, unexplained sudden death in a young person<br />
♥	Fainting (syncope) or seizure during exercise, excitement or startle<br />
♥	Consistent or unusual chest pain and/or shortness of breath during exercise<br />
●	Ask your school or child’s sports association to make this questionnaire a mandatory for all kids before they participate in any active sport.<br />
For more information, call (801) 272-3023 or visit www.StopSADS.org.<br />
The life you save may be your child’s…or your own!</p>
<p>Pediatric Sudden Cardiac Death<br />
Risk Assessment Form<br />
Parents, answer these questions (or have your child’s doctor help complete them) every few years at these times: preschool, before/during middle school, before/during high school, and before participating in organized sports.</p>
<p>Patient History Questions	Yes	No<br />
Has your child fainted or passed out DURING exercise, emotion or startle?<br />
Has your child fainted or passed out AFTER exercise?<br />

                        <p>As always, the safety of your child is our utmost concern. Please help us maintain a safe environment in the parking areas around the building by observing the following rules. If you need to drop off your child before school or pick them up after school, always pull into the main lot on the south side of the building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After school, all students who are not riding a bus will exit through the main front door and will be directed to cars by the teachers on duty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Please pull all the way up to the sign designated for the start of Parent pick up.   Do not stop in front of the Main Entrance.</li>
<li>In order to keep the flow of cars moving, students will load beyond the curve as parents pull up.</li>
<li><strong><u>Students must use the crosswalk</u></strong> if parents are parked in the lot. A staff member will help students cross.</li>
<li>Do not drive behind the school, as this route is reserved for buses only.</li>

                        <p><strong><u>Reminders about Medications at School&#8230;</u></strong></p>
<p>As we go into the spring season, I’d like to remind parents about the school district policy for sending in medications to school. This policy states that a note from the parent and/or doctor must accompany the medication.  Below you will find information regarding the Medication Policy for Prescription and Non-Prescription Medications.</p>
<p><strong><u>PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION</u></strong> can be administered at school, if necessary, following all of these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li> Note from physician with:  **</li>
<li> Name of medication</li>
<li> Dosage</li>
<li> Time to be administered</li>
<li> Side effects</li>
<li> Start/ End Date</li>
<li> Signature of the physician</li>
<li> Note from the parent giving permission to administer (with parent’s signature)</li>
<li> Medication must be in the original pharmacy labeled container.</li>
</ol>
<p>** You may obtain a <em><u>Request for Administration of Medication by School Personnel Grades K-12 </u></em>form in the school office or on the PLSD website.</p>
<p><strong><u>NON-PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION</u></strong> (like cough drops, Tylenol, cough syrup) can be administered, if necessary, and requires:</p>
<ol>
<li> Note from parent with: ***</li>
<li> Name of student</li>
<li> Name of medication</li>
<li> Time to be administered</li>
<li> Dosage to be given</li>
<li> Signature of parent and date</li>
<li> Medication must be in the original container</li>
<li> Dosage must be age and weight appropriate for your child.</li>
</ol>
<p>(i.e., We cannot administer medication to children under 12 if the label says: “Do not administer to children under 12, except under the direction of a physician.”  We need to have a note from the doctor in order to give a dose of medication that is different than the dose stated on the bottle.)</p>
<p>*** You may obtain an <em>Administering Nonprescription Medication-Grades K-12</em> form in the school office or on the PLSD website.</p>

                        <p>Now that spring is here and the weather will be getting nice, bike riding is a great way to spend time together as a family while getting fresh air and exercise.</p>
<p>Wearing a helmet when bicycle riding should not be an option for anyone in the family even if it is for short distances in a safe area.</p>
<p>Helmets are important because most bicycle accidents involve head injuries that could cause permanent brain damage or death. Each year in the United States, about half a million kids are seriously injured in a bicycle-related accident. Most of these injuries could have been avoided if a helmet was worn.</p>
<p>When choosing a bicycle helmet the main things to keep in mind are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick bright colors that are visible to motorist and other cyclists.</li>
<li>Make sure the helmet is well ventilated.</li>
<li>Make sure that the helmet has a CPSC or Snell sticker inside. These indicate that the helmet meets standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) or the Snell Memorial Foundation, a nonprofit group that test helmet safety.</li>
<li>Make sure your child’s helmet fits correctly and can be adjusted. If you purchase your helmet at a bike store, you should be able to get assistance with the fit and adjustment of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to replace any helmet made before 1999. If your child hits any surface hard while wearing a helmet, replace it. Helmets lose their capacity to absorb shock after taking serious hits.</p>

                        <p>How are Pickerington Schools “leaping” into the future?<br />
Answers to that question are the focus of the 2016 State of the Schools presentation and Celebration of Excellence Expo, planned for Leap Day on Monday, Feb. 29.<br />
The public is invited and encouraged to attend this event, to be held in the Pickerington High School Central Performing Arts Center from 6:30 to 8:15 p.m.<br />

At 7:15 p.m., Superintendent Valerie Browning-Thompson and Treasurer Ryan Jenkins will present the 2016 State of the Schools, a 45-minute presentation covering subjects ranging from the district’s financial outlook to academic initiatives and plans for the future.

The presentation will open and close with musical performances by the PHSC Band and PHSN Choir.<br />

Members will also be invited to the BBC party at the end of the school year. You may join at any time. Your donated books will be a gift to our library that can be opened again and again.

                        <p>The state mandated Vision and Hearing screenings are in the process of being done for all Kindergarten, 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> graders. If your student does not pass, you will be notified that further assessment by a professional eye or ear specialist is recommended.

<p>Also, as we get closer to cold and flu season, please remember to follow the district guidelines in regards to medications at school as well as keeping your child home when ill. You can find the details for this information in the packet of information sent home at the beginning of the school year, as well as at the Health Services section of the PLSD website:</p>

<p><strong>FLU SEASON IS COMING</strong></p>
<p>Which of these symptoms describe influenza?</p>
<ol>
<li>Stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea.</li>
<li>Runny nose, sneezing and normal temperature.</li>
<li>High fever, headache and cough.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you picked #3, you are right! Vomiting and diarrhea are not the flu at all, but you will hear many people saying they have “the flu” with these symptoms. Actually they may have an infection in their stomach or intestinal system called gastroenteritis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cold is described in #2. Headaches and fever do not commonly occur with a cold, but cold symptoms are present with influenza. You may also have body aches, feel tired, have chills, a cough and a sore throat with the flu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like many illnesses, the influenza virus is spread from the respiratory tract. If the mouth or nose is exposed to the virus particles in the air, or on a surface that has been contaminated with the virus, you are likely to get sick with influenza. Someone is contagious from one day before symptoms start until five days after becoming ill. You can help to prevent illnesses by using good personal hygiene. Persons with colds or the flu need to cover their mouths when sneezing or coughing. Then immediately afterward wash their hands because any article they touch after sneezing may carry a virus. The other way to prevent spreading the illness is by washing your own hands frequently. This is especially true before eating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to prevent getting infected by the influenza virus is by getting a flu vaccine every year. The earlier in the season that you get the shot, the stronger your immunity will be to fight the virus. The flu vaccine is safe and recommended for most of the population. The people who should not get the vaccine are children under six months of age, those with a severe egg allergy, having a history of developing Guillain-Barreí syndrome after a previous vaccine, and people who have a moderate or severe illness accompanied by a fever (you just need to wait until the fever is gone before getting the vaccine).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vaccine is especially recommended for those at high risk, which include children from 6 months to 19 years, pregnant women, people over 50, those with a chronic medical condition and those living with or caring for those who are at high risk of getting the flu. The flu vaccine contains killed virus with which the body will build defenses. Since there is no live virus in the vaccine, you cannot get ill from getting the flu shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See if you can identify the true statements from the myths.</p>
<p><u>True</u> or <u>False</u> (answers at bottom of the page)</p>
<ol>
<li>More than 200,000 people each year have complications from the flu that put them in the hospital.</li>
<li>People with asthma should not get the vaccine.</li>
<li>It is not safe to return to work or school after resting for a day or two of having the flu since you are still contagious.</li>
<li>You have to get a new shot every year, because different viruses cause the flu each year.</li>
<li>Over the counter medications can help relieve some of the symptoms of the flu.</li>
<li>The flu can be diarrhea and vomiting rather than cold like symptoms.</li>
<li>A cough can last for weeks to months after the other flu symptoms disappear.</li>
<li>When sick with the flu, you need to drink a lot of liquid and get plenty of rest.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last note, if you or a loved one comes down with flu symptoms, you should go to your doctor right away. If caught in the first day or two, the doctor may give you anti-viral medication that will decrease the symptoms and length of your illness. Some great Internet resources about influenza are:</p>

                        <p>Dear Families,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The holidays are quickly approaching along with all the wonderful memories made during these special times. The holidays are an enjoyable time with family and friends, however, that does not mean that they are not stressful! I realize some families may need some assistance providing a memorable holiday for their children. Pickerington Schools are teaming up, once again, with the Violet Township Fire Department to help provide some assistance for families in need during this holiday season.</p>
<p>For those out and about during the holiday season, you may see big red boxes throughout the community and in the schools. If you would like to donate a new toy/gift for the holiday season it can be placed in the big red boxes. If you would prefer to donate in other ways, please let me know.</p>
<p>If you would like an application for holiday assistance this year, please contact me at kelli_saksa@plsd.us or 614-834-6400. The application will then be provided to you, only one application per household please. This application is handled in a confidential manner; however, the information will be shared with local agencies. More details will be shared with applicants. The deadline for applications in will be NOVEMBER 20<sup>th</sup>, 2015.</p>

                        <p>Ohio First Lady Karen Kasich visited Toll Gate Middle School Wednesday to learn more about the school’s lunch program. Mrs. Kasich talked to staff and students, helping to pass out milk during lunch.</p>
<p>The event coincided with National School Lunch Week. Toll Gate Middle School was picked for the visit, in part, because it received the Healthy U.S. School Challenge Award in 2012. The district’s food service program also was named one of the Top 100 food service programs in the country in 2015 by “Best Foods”!</p>

                        <p>Recently Mrs. Saksa, our Guidance Counselor offered &#8220;Coffee with the Counselor&#8221;.  The topic of discussion was &#8220;Transitioning into 5th Grade&#8221; and Parent/Teacher Conference Tips!  Mrs. Saksa shared the following articles with the group.</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE SCHOOL TRANSITION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emotional/Social Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start to form stronger, more complex friendships and peer relationships. It becomes more emotionally important to have friends, especially of the same sex.</li>
<li>Experience more peer pressure.</li>
<li>Become more aware of his or her body as puberty approaches. Body image and eating problems sometimes start around this age.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thinking and Learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Face more academic challenges at school.</li>
<li>Become more independent from the family.</li>
<li>Begin to see the point of view of others more clearly.</li>
<li>Have an increased attention span.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positive Parenting Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Know where your child is and who they are with; meet families of your child’s friends.</li>
<li>Monitor all screens (tv/social media &#8211; it’s not just about the phone)</li>
<li>Spend time with your child. Talk with her about her friends, her accomplishments, and what challenges she will face.</li>
<li>Be involved with your child’s school. Go to school events; meet your child’s teachers.</li>
<li>Help your child develop his own sense of right and wrong.</li>
<li>Help your child set his own goals. Encourage him to think about skills and abilities he would like to have and about how to develop them.</li>
<li>Use discipline to guide and protect your child, instead of punishment to make him feel badly about himself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parent/Teacher Conference Tips</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plan ahead</strong></p>
<p>Mark your calendar. For families where the parents are separated or divorced, and if there are step-parents, try to ensure that everyone is included whenever possible (and if there&#8217;s not too much tension). The goal is for all parties involved to be aware of what&#8217;s happening in the classroom, even if they&#8217;re participating via speaker phone.</p>
<p><strong>Come prepared</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely that the conference will flow smoothly and the teacher will jump right in and kick off a constructive discussion. Still, it can&#8217;t hurt to have a few questions in your back pocket, in case he or she doesn&#8217;t hit all of the points you&#8217;re hoping will be addressed. Here are a few examples.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>What do you see as my child&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses?</li>
<li>What can we do at home to help maintain progress and success?</li>
<li>At what point will we hear from you if you sense a problem?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Start with a team-player approach</strong></p>
<p>Approach challenges or issues the teacher raises with the attitude of &#8220;<em>We</em> have to address this problem as partners.&#8221; This makes coming up with solutions considerably easier for everyone involved &#8212; objectivity will be crucial for a successful school year.</p>
<p><strong>Keep the teacher informed</strong></p>
<p>Teachers love-and appreciate-knowing what&#8217;s going on with your child, both at the time of the conference and beyond. It&#8217;s important to keep him or her up on any changes in your child&#8217;s life, such as medications, family problems, if it&#8217;s a dual-home family, or if a family member went into the hospital. Mandel points out, &#8220;Sometimes a child starts acting up in class, and the teacher thinks it&#8217;s just a behavior problem, but doesn&#8217;t realize that Grandpa had a heart attack this weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Respect the teacher&#8217;s time</strong></p>
<p>Conferences are only 15 minutes.  You might have questions after the meeting ends, and even in the days that follow. Before you leave, ask the teacher, &#8220;How do you prefer that we contact you-after school, via email, with a phone call?&#8221; Keeping a list of your questions and concerns can help you organize your thoughts so you can approach the teacher effectively whenever necessary. If you have a specific concern after the conference, definitely let the teacher know. Say something like, &#8220;I have some questions about this issue. When would be a good time for me to contact you?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maintain perspective</strong></p>
<p>Teachers really do understand how you feel about your child. Your goal is to leave the conference feeling confident in your child&#8217;s teacher and in the team effort that has just commenced in the interest of your child.</p>
<p><strong>Report new strategies</strong></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to involve after-school caregivers in what you&#8217;ve learned. Need a new homework plan? Create an after-school snack-and-study strategy and then an after-dinner review. Get all parents and caregivers on board so your child can have the most successful school year possible.</p>
