				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chandler campus opened in 2002 and is conveniently located at north Arizona Avenue and east Warner Road just north of downtown Chandler. It is accessible from several major freeways and the Valley Metro 12 Route (Country Club/Arizona Ave). </p>
<p>Kenny deLoera has been the principal at our Chandler campus since 2015. He began his career with IntelliSchool as a math teacher in 2012 but has been an educator for years. Principal deLoera and the staff are very passionate about helping students achieve their individual goals – whatever those may be. From credit recovery to a high school diploma to a more flexible academic experience, the staff at the Chandler campus recognize students come to IntelliSchool for different reasons, and they are ready and eager to support them.</p>
<p>The Chandler campus is supported by three teachers, and a full-time counselor. Tutors are available at this campus to assist students. In addition, the Chandler campus partners with Arizona State University’s Service Learning Program, which provides additional academic assistance to students throughout the year. This campus makes math intervention services available to its students.</p>
<p>The Chandler campus offers three daily sessions. The morning session is from <b>8:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.</b>, the afternoon session is from <b>12:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m.</b>, and the evening session is from <b>4:00 p.m. –  8:00 p.m.</b> Students are asked to attend one session per day for a total of twenty hours a week. </p>
<p>The Chandler campus’s largest session is its morning session with approximately 40 students. At least two staff members are available per session, but oftentimes there are three or more.  </p>
<p>During school sessions, snacks and drinks are available to students for purchase. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traditional high school isn’t for everyone, and at IntelliSchool we think that’s OK. In fact, it’s one of the reasons we’re here. IntelliSchool is a public charter high school with four convenient locations in the Phoenix Metro area. At IntelliSchool we recognize a traditional high school experience isn’t necessarily the best experience. We also recognize it shouldn’t be your only option. If you agree, learn more about how we’ve designed our schools because everything we do – the way we teach, the way we structure the day, and the way we tailor curriculum – is done to help our students achieve their academic goals. </p>
<p>Here are some of the things that make us different: </p>
<h4>Four-Hour School Days and Flexible Scheduling</h4>
<p>For working students or those that are supporting families, a seven or eight-hour school day can be too much. As a public charter high school, we offer a school day that is four hours long. You pick from one of three daily sessions. Each of our campuses has a morning, afternoon and evening session. You choose the one that works best for you. Even better? You don’t have to attend the same session every day of the week. If the morning session works best on Monday and Wednesday, and the evening session is what you need for Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, that’s fine. </p>
<h4>Customized Academics and Self-Paced</h4>
<p>Not all students learn the same way. This is a fact of life and one we understand at IntelliSchool. Our students come from a variety of backgrounds and circumstances, and it’s our goal to help each one achieve academic success. This means we don’t take a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, we assess our students and create academic plans that make sense for every individual. We also allow students to work faster or slower, depending on their needs and goals. </p>
<h4>Computer-Based and Supportive</h4>
<p>Part of what allows us to customize our curriculum is that we have a computer-based learning environment, which means students work independently on a computer at school. This does not make us an online school. Our students are required to attend class, which gives them daily interaction with our principals, teachers, counselors, tutors and interns who help students one-one-one or in group settings. </p>
<h4>Safe and Comfortable Environment</h4>
<p>At IntelliSchool, it is very important our students feel comfortable and safe in school. We have a zero-tolerance policy on bullying. In fact, we tell incoming students that if they are interested in traditional high school drama, they are at the wrong high school. Creating a safe learning environment is one of our top priorities, and our staff does this by building relationships with students founded in respect. </p>
<h4>Open Enrollment Year-Round</h4>
<p>We have a year-round open enrollment policy. Students can enroll at any time and for any reason. If you are looking to get caught up on credits, consider IntelliSchool. If you’re interested in graduating early, consider IntelliSchool. If you’re looking for a change from a traditional high school environment for any reason, consider IntelliSchool. We’re an alternative high school choice for you any day of the year.</p>
<p>At IntelliSchool, we think differently about high school. If you are looking for a different high school experience, <a href="/index.php/pre-enroll/">pre-enroll with us today</a>. Not ready to pre-enroll? Learn more about our <a href="/index.php/registration-info/">registration requirements</a> or <a href="/index.php/2016/09/28/locations/">our campuses</a>. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IntelliSchool is an AdvancED accredited public charter high school. AdvancED is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that accredits primary and secondary schools throughout the United States. To become accredited, IntelliSchool had to meet a comprehensive list of academic criteria and procedures that contribute to a quality educational experience. IntelliSchool has been accredited by AdvancED since 2013.</p>
<p>Accreditation is important to students because it means IntelliSchool credits are transferable to other accredited high schools. Accreditation is also important if you’re considering joining the military or going to college. It’s a verification for any organization that reviews your academic record, but that’s not the only reason it matters.</p>
<p>Here’s what accreditation means for you:</p>
<h4>External and Independent Verification</h4>
<p>Accreditation is a verification from an outside agency that schools are meeting the promises they have made. Essentially, it means a third-party has reviewed and verified we are who we say we are, and we’re following procedures and protocol to provide a quality learning environment for our students.</p>
<h4>Extensive Quality Measurements</h4>
<p>To become accredited, schools must meet extensive quality measurements, which is a thorough and lengthy process. We do this to give you confidence when you choose us as your school. It means our school is meeting the standards that have been defined by a highly-reputable organization.</p>
<h4>Continual Reviews and Opportunities to Improve</h4>
<p>Accreditation isn’t a one-time thing. Once accredited, our work doesn’t end. We continue to meet with accrediting agencies to ensure we are reaching their standards. This is important to you because it means our work is never done, and there’s always an opportunity for us to improve for our students. </p>
