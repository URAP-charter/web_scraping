Monte del Sol is a small, rigorous, community-minded, public Charter School. It maintains a non-sectarian program and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, handicap, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or cultural heritage in the administration of its educational programs. We embrace diversity fully. <br />
<br />
Monte del Sol was founded in December 1999 in a spirit of collaboration with and support from the Santa Fe School District.&nbsp;The founders believed that learning best takes place in a small school environment where every student is known well. They recognized that all learning is relational and that interactive, engaged learning is an essential element. A typical day may include project-oriented teaching, class discussion, reflective journal writing, experiential work, outdoor education, independent projects and individualized instruction as well as traditional lecture models. The school has an outstanding special services department serving the high numbers of gifted students and special needs students. Homework is expected in most classes.<br />
<br />
Every student has a faculty advisor with whom they meet at least once a week in 'Home Group' to set and monitor academic and social goals and to build a respectful bond between student and adult. With a few exceptions, every faculty member in the school has a Home Group of ten to twelve students.&nbsp; Home Group Advisors also facilitate two parent conferences a year with the student and his or her parents to review performance and to set goals. To date, we have had over 98% parent participation at conferences.<br />
<br />
Monte del Sol's diversity is reflected in the current year's enrollment of 43% Hispanic students, 4% Asian students, 48% 'Anglo' students, 5% bi-racial students as well as in the wide range of ability levels.&nbsp; We average a 93 percent retention rate of the student body and a 95 percent graduation rate.&nbsp; Ted Sizer's Coalition of Essential Schools www.essentialschools.org serves as a guide to the development of the school.<br />
<br />
Admission to Monte del Sol is through an annual lottery drawing and since our founding we have an approximately 8 to 1 ratio of applicants to spaces available.&nbsp; Charter Schools in New Mexico are required to renew their Charter every five years and our Charter was renewed in 2004 and 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since its founding, Monte del Sol has made a significant impact on education in the Santa Fe community and we trust that the best is still to come.
