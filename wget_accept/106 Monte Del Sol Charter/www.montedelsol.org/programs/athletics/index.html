<p>
We have a strong, 
competitive and exciting athletics program building on success year-after-year offering soccer, volleyball, basketball and baseball.&nbsp; We do not offer football. &nbsp;See
list of coaches and directions to home games below.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, please call &nbsp;Athletics Coordinator, Alfredo Lujan, &nbsp;505-670-2339 alujan@montedelsol.org &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Despite not having a home field, our <strong>Boys' Soccer</strong> team has qualified for State for eight years and were seeded #5 in 2011. Our <strong>Girls' Soccer</strong> team qualified for State for the first time in 2011. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Our Varsity <strong>Boys' Basketball</strong> program has qualified for State four times and has always attracted quality atheletes. &nbsp;Our Basketball team was first in the District in 03-04, qualified for regionals in 04-05 and state in 05-06.&nbsp; Go Dragons! &nbsp;<strong>Girls' Basketball&nbsp;</strong>program is strong and proactive, poised for success.&nbsp; Additionally, we consistently build our Middle School and JV programs to prepare our athletes for Varsity play.<br />
<br />
Our <strong>Volleyball</strong> Girls are hardworking and focused. Though they have not yet qualified for post-season play they now believe that they are ready to turn the corner. <br />
<br />
Our <strong>Baseball</strong> team was on an 18-game win streak and ended the season with a 22-3 overall record two years ago.&nbsp; We are now in a rebuilding phase and working diligently to expand the program. <br />
<br />
Athletics are open to all <strong>High School </strong>students and there is a 'no cut' policy, meaning all students who try out for a team will play to some degree.&nbsp; For more details and up-to-date game information, contact <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Athletics Director, Lisa Otero, 982-5225 ext. 103 or cell 231-2415.</span><br />
<br />
As we do not have our own gym nor soccer field, practices and home games take place either at Genoveva Chavez Community Center, Ft. Marcy Complex or the Municipal Recreation Complex (MRC) fields off Hwy. 599 depending on the sport and season.&nbsp;
