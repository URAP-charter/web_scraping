<strong>Monte del Sol Charter School</strong><br />
<strong>
Enrollment Policies and Procedures</strong><br />
</div>
<!--///////Guidelines start//////--><!--/////////////////////////////--><!--/////////////////////////////--><br />
<strong>Enrollment Lottery
</strong><br />
New Mexico Charter School law requires that admission to Monte del Sol Charter School be decided
by a lottery drawing. The Lottery Application form is available online at www.montedelsol.org
from October 17, 2016 through February 17, 2017 at 3:00 p.m. Each year, over 500 students
apply for grades 7 through 12.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Admissions Open House
</strong><br />
Monte del Sol will host an Admissions Open House on Tuesday, October 25, 2016, 5:30 p.m. for
parents and students wishing to learn more about Monte del Sol Charter School. Please come to
meet our teachers and learn more about Monte del Sol Charter School.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Lottery Results
</strong><br />
A list of student names and their lottery number will be posted on the home page of our
website, www.montedelsol.org, the day after the drawing. Waiting list progress will be
regularly updated on our Admissions page.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Lottery Drawing
</strong><br />
The lottery drawing is open to the public, and will take place at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, February
22, 2017 in the Monte del Sol Gathering Space. Lottery numbers for each grade are assigned to
each lottery applicant by a computer-based random number generator. Attendance at the lottery
drawing is optional and does not affect your child&rsquo;s chances of acceptance.
You will be notified by phone, email and/or mail if we reach your child&rsquo;s lottery number. Please
contact the school immediately if your contact information changes. Monte del Sol is not responsible
for incorrect contact information. You must sign and return the acceptance letter within three
school days of notification of acceptance. If we do not receive a signed acceptance letter, the
space will be offered to the next student on the waiting list.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Enrollment Openings
</strong><br />
If an enrollment opening becomes available during the school year, we notify each family on the
waiting list until the opening is filled. If your student is not accepted, you must enter the lottery the
following year. Waiting lists do not carry over from year to year.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Sibling Enrollment Policy
</strong><br />
Siblings of currently enrolled Monte del Sol students are granted sibling preference and will be
placed first in any open spots at each grade level. Siblings of currently enrolled students who
wish to attend Monte del Sol must be entered in the online lottery. A sibling waiting list will be
created if there are more siblings than spaces available in each grade. If a parent does not enter
their sibling student in the lottery, that student will be placed at the bottom of the sibling waiting list.
A sibling is defined as a brother or sister of a student attending Monte del Sol Charter School at the
time of the lottery who:
<br />
 is living in the same household and has one or both parents in common;
<br />
 is a half-sibling or step-sibling living in the same household as a currently enrolled student; or
 is a child under court-ordered legal guardianship of parent(s) of a student currently attending
Monte del Sol. Verification of sibling status is required.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Special Education Students
(Student&rsquo;s with an Individual Education Plan (IEP)).
</strong><br />
New Mexico Charter School law requires that all students, regardless of Special Education status,
must submit an online lottery application in order to attend Monte del Sol Charter School. If your
child with an IEP is accepted for enrollment, please contact our Special Services Director at 982-
5225 ext.106 to discuss accommodations and special needs.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Visiting, Observing and Shadowing
</strong><br />
Prospective parents and students are invited to attend the Open House on October 25, 2016 at 5:30
p.m. in our Gathering Space. Shadowing and parent observation is available after the lottery drawing
for students who have been accepted for enrollment. Please make an appointment for shadowing in
our school office.
