				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The front parking lot at Shiloh School is not the biggest and can create dangerous situations if everyone is not careful.  The parking lot is an area that will be addressed with the campus expansion in order to help the flow of traffic.  Until then, please use the side parking lot and drop your child off on the curb or drive slowly and be alert in the front parking lot.  We have had accidents in the past and Stanislaus County has already seen accidents involving children at school campuses this school year.  If you are using the front parking lot, please do not double park, pull half-way into a parking spot, open doors without looking, pull out without being attentive … and most importantly <strong>Drive Slowly!</strong>  None of us want anything tragic to happen at Shiloh School so be safe!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, Shiloh School has been planning for the last couple of years to expand the campus, build classrooms, and split combination classrooms into single grade classrooms.  That part of the project started this year by adding a temporary portable classroom, hiring Mrs. Lark, and splitting the 3/4 combo.  Our plans are on track to pass final approval at the state level and a petition has been approved for the November 2016 ballot for a $7 billion School Capital Facilities Bond.</p>
<p>We would like to encourage everyone to go out and vote next fall!</p>
